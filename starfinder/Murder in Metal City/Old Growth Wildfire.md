**Action Hero** When you successfully make a ranged Strike with an automatic weapon, you suppress the target until the start of your next turn. In addition, when you Auto--Fire, the size of the cone is equal to the weapon's full range increment, rather than half. When using the Auto--Fire action, you can designate a target anywhere in the cone to be your primary target, rather than the creature closest to you.

**Burst of Strength** `[reaction]` (fortune) **Frequency** once per hour; **Trigger** You fail an Athletics check to Disarm, Grapple, Reposition, Shove, or Trip; **Effect** You draw on your inner reserves and rally to try again. Reroll the triggering check, but you must use the new result, even if it's worse.

**Khizar Senses and Speech** Khizars struggle to speak in conventional humanoid languages without assistive implants. Instead, they communicate through a complicated syntax of swaying vines, creaking limbs, and pulsating seedpods. Most often, they speak telepathically using a common language. Khizars don't "see" most other creatures do, but their sensory organs give them an awareness of sources of heat and light around them that acts similarly to true vision.
