**Four Armed** You have four arms, which allows you to wield and hold up to four hands' worth of weapons and equipment. At any time, one pair of hands is designated as your active hands. You can change this designation one pair of hands to another by taking the Switch Hands `[one-action]` action. You can wield items only with your active hands.

**Area Fire** `[one-action]` electromag grenade (5--foot burst, range 70 feet), **Damage** 1d8 electricity (DC 17 basic Reflex); on a critical failure they are also glitching 1

**Aim** `[one-action]` (concentrate) **Requirements** You're wielding a ranged weapon that doesn't have the area trait. **Effect** You take careful aim at a single creature that you're aware of, designating it as your mark. Until the end of your turn, your ranged Strikes against your mark using the required ranged weapon deal an additional 1d4 precision damage and reduce the circumstance bonus to AC your mark gains from cover by 1. These benefits only apply if your mark is within your weapon's first range increment. You can only have mark at a time.

**Sabotage** `[one-action]` (concentrate, manipulate) You disrupt enemy tech to cover your tracks or gain a tactical advantage. Select a single tech creature or tech item within 15 feet that you can detect. If your target is a tech creature, attempt a Computers check against the creature's Fortitide DC. If your target is a tech item, attempt a Computers check against the item's DC or the Reflect DC of the creature posessing the item if the item is being carried, held, or worn.
	**Critical Success** The target becomes glitching 1 for 1 minute.
	**Success** The target becomes glitching 1 for 2 rounds.
	**Failure** Your attempt fails and requires more persistent analysis. The target is immune to your Sabotage until the end of your next turn.
	**Critical Failure** Your attempt backfires. The target is immune to your Sabotage for 10 minutes.
	**Enhanced Exploit:** You can Sabotage as a free action whenever you critically hit a tech creature with a melee or ranged attack, targeting the triggering creature. You can Sabotage as a reaction whenever a tech creature or a creature using a tech weapon critically fails a melee attack roll against you, targeting the triggering creature or weapon.

**Weakening Shot** `[two-actions]` **Requirements** You're wielding a gun. **Effect** You target a creature's limbs or load--bearing appendages to weaken them. You Aim and then make a ranged Strike against your mark. If the Strike hits, the creature becomes your choice of clumsy 1 or enfeebled 1 until the end of your next turn (clumsy 2 or enfeebled 2 on a critical hit).

**Express Driver** You know how to get there fast. When calculating your travel Speed for the day while piloting a vehicle, you can attempt a Piloting check to increase your vehicle's travel Speed for long--term overland or aerial travel. The DC is determined by the GM but is typically based on the vehicle's piloting DC or a difficulty based on the environment, whichever is harder. On a success, double your vehicle's travel Speed for the day. This has no effect on your vehicle's movement in encounters or on starships traveling through the Drift.
