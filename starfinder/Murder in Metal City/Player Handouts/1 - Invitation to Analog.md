ENCRYPTED MESSAGE LOG
ID VERIFIED ACCESS GRANTED

Friend,

I recognize that it has been some time since our last communication. I hope this transmission finds you well—and finds you at all. We live in exciting times, and I believe there is a chance (14.6% or more) that this communication is intercepted before you receive it. Which is exactly why I have asked you to meet me. There is much to tell you. I can’t share over a comm unit, even with encryption.

Meet me in downgrid Striving. I have a reservation at Analog Cafe, and my tab should still be open when you arrive. Meet there in two days exactly. Except company, as I have invited others. You can recognize one another by this pass phrase: “incredulous static.”

Your friend,
Tier–99–Professor, Polytechnica
