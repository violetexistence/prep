Ghellon (charming jaded female android entrepreneur) owns Analog Cafe, a famous establishment in downtown Striving. Originally from the Nitilema slums on Verces, Ghellon doesn’t remember all her personas—companion, hacker, porter, thug—before she bought a shuttle pass to Aballon and rebooted her life. She used dirty money to acquire Analog and tipped the algorithm, local slang for bribing an official to rig your Insight Array assignment, allowing her to create a small hospitality empire. Twenty-three years of excellent service, safe spectacle, and culture have earned Ghellon a position of respect in the community.

A newly honest businessperson, Ghellon enjoys bartending and working the floor alongside her robotic staff. She handles most difficult customer service situations.

**Adventure Role:** Ghellon might guide the PCs if their investigation stalls, feed them info they missed framed as juicy gossip she overheard, or just pour them free drinks and commiserate while they discuss where to go next. If her attitude is helpful, Ghellon might help bail the PCs out of a tight spot, such as by showing up to defend them in a trial.

**Making an Impression:** Ghellon’s weakness is flattery (DC 14 Diplomacy or Deception), though she tersely denies it. She likes big tippers (20 credits or more) and anyone who can mix her favorite cocktail, a Cuvacara Sunset (DC 14 Beverage Lore, Chemistry Lore, or Society; the drink has notes of diesel, sweat, and orange juice). Once per week, a success at any of these checks increases her attitude by one step; critical failure decreases her attitude by one step unless she’s already helpful toward someone in the party.

**Ally Benefits:** +1 circumstance bonus to one Diplomacy, Deception, or Intimidation check per week (friendly); free drinks (helpful).
