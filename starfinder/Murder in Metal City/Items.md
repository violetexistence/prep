This sleek black device attaches to a backpack, purse, or key ring. When you press a button on the side of the device, it creates a circular portal to an extradimensional pocket space. The space's capacity depends on the device's type.
You can interact with the *null space chamber* to stow items in it or remove them. The *null space chamber* can be opened and closed only from the outside. When a *null space chamber* is opened in an atmosphere with air it fills with 10 minutes' worth of air for every Bulk left in its capacity. An item inside the null space chamber provides no benefits unless it's retrieved first. Connecting the *null space chamber* to a computer causes it to display a readout of all items stored within it.

These latticed gemstones are suspended in a silicon casing and encoded with the magical script necessary to cast a single, specific spell.

The spell must appear on your spell list. Because you're the one Casting the Spell, use your spell attack modifier and spell DC. The spell must be of your spellcasting tradition. The spell in a spell gem can be cast only once, and the *spell gem* is destroyed as part of the casting. Spell gems can't contain cantrips or rituals. The traits for this item vary based on the spell it contains.
