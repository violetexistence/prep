Aeluon are one of three founding species in the [[Galactic Commons]]. They are notable for their advanced technology, particularly weapons. Their homeworld is [[Sohep Frie]].
## Appearance & Biology
Aeluons are a four limbed, bipedal species similar to humans, but with silver skin composed of fine scales which never molt. They are bald, and have large eyes with second eyelids and small mouths. They have iridescent patches on their cheeks which are used for communication via color. When an Aeluon becomes fertile with eggs, their scales shimmer faintly.
## Genders & Fertility
Aeluons have four distinct genders. One that produces eggs, one that can fertilize them, one that involuntarily switches between the two (called "shon"), and one that is infertile. Pre-space travel Aeluon culture segregated Aeluon villages by gender, Shimmerquick being one of the very few occasions different genders interacted.

Egg-producing Aeluons only become fertile two or three times in their lives, at most. Some of them never do. They are expected to take time off once they begin to shimmer and head to a facility to mate and have their egg. This can be a stressful time for Aeluons, so it is made as comfortable as possible and treated like a vacation. Aeluon gestation takes about a month. The Aeluon mother does not take care of their offspring but many stay in close contact with them, especially ground-dwelling Aeluons. Spacer Aeluons have a harder time keeping in touch with their children. Aeluon children are raised in creches by groups of fathers who are specifically educated for this purpose.
## Culture & History
Aeluons are known to be somewhat superstitious, putting significance into certain numbers and symbols. Interspecies relationships are taboo in Aeluon society, as they are seen as a threat to the species' future.
## Color-based Communication
Aeluons are deaf and mute, so do not traditionally speak. Instead, they communicate with each other through patches of skin located on their cheeks that are capable of flashing different colors rapidly. After making contact with other creatures and joining the Galactic Commons, Aeluon travellers have taken to implanting voice emulators into their throats to be able to communicate verbally with other species and implants that catch sound and transform it to signals that Aeluon brains can understand. As spacial hearing is a concept that just can't be processed by Aeluons, the implants produce a tingling sensation in the skin of their head in the direction the sound is coming from. Adult Aeluons' sound-processing implants are often highly decorative.

Aeluons unsettle me, though not for the reasons you might think. I am not frightened of them. It is not fear — more like the feeling of stepping into a house where someone has just stopped speaking and you know you have interrupted something private.

At first you think you know what you are looking at: two arms, two legs, shoulder like yours, a familiar tilt to the head. They move with a kind of contained grace that makes you want to mirror them, the way you unconsciously match the posture of someone you trust. For a moment, they seem almost like house-family, someone you might sit with over a warm meal.

And then the light shifts and their scales wake.

The silver is the first thing you notice — smooth, unbroken, a surface that does not molt, does not change. I find myself imagining what it would be like to grow and age inside the same surface all your life. No moment of casting off the old skin, no ritual molt-dance with your feather sibs, no fresh start. Every scrape they have ever taken must still be there, somewhere, polished smooth but not forgotten.

And then their cheeks flash. The colors speak before the talk-box does. It is impossible to ignore, not because it is loud but because it is *present*. Conversation with an Aeluon is something you witness with your whole body, like sitting by a hearth where the light plays on everyone’s faces.

Some say this is too vulnerable — that to show one’s thoughts so openly invites danger. I disagree. Living in such openness is its own form of strength. It is saying, “Here is what I feel. I will not hide it, and I will stand with you.”

I know this is just biology. Gravity, atmosphere, selection pressure. But when I share a room with an Aeluon, I feel that tug to pay attention, to slow down. They are a people who make you choose your words carefully, even if you are only thinking them. They unsettle me, yes — but perhaps only because they remind me how much of my own life I live without truly seeing who is in front of me.
