Is participation the key? When people people feel powerless, when they check out, what takes the place of participation?

The player characters are members of a (GC equivalent Scout Service) team. Their mission is to travel to a remote colony and address certain infrastructure and safety issues raised by the colonists. Mission briefing contains an official report on damages and injuries caused by a recent flood, including one fatality, as well as a petition from a local advocacy group requesting aid from the GC to help bring their communities architecture and building practices up to code.

[[Timeline]]

**Faction** Dreamers
	Believers in Zara's Haven's founding principles: radical inclusion, self-expression, and participation. They see the colony as a living art piece — one that must never be finished.
	Core Belief: We came here to discover our soul's potential free of shackles
	Goal: Preserve Zara's Haven as a social experiment, even if that means living with risk and impermanence.
	- Assemblers - Ephemeral builders who see disaster cleanup as creative opportunity. Could be convinced to adopt more permanence
	- Rootbound - Settlers who try to keep some continuity (farms, dwellings) while still resisting outside authority.
	- Logistarchs The keepers of counts and ledgers, unpopular but crucial. May secretly welcome GC oversight to gain more influence over the Dreamer faction.

**Faction** Grounders
	Practical-minded colonists who want safety, accessibility, and opportunity. They don't necessarily oppose the dream, but think the cost of chaos is too high — especially for the vulnerable.
	Core Belief Freedom without safety is just negligence.
	Goal Bring the colony’s infrastructure up to GC standards and make it more attractive for outside investment.
	- Access Collective Advocates for those harmed by the current direction: disabled colonists, children, offworlders who don’t yet “get” the Haven’s culture.
	- Prospector’s League Resources-minded capitalists who see Zara’s Haven as a beachhead for exploiting the nearby moon.
	- Anchorhouse Would-be civic planner who envision a proper starport, clinics, permanent levees, and power grid.

**Faction** Aurivants
	*Keepers of the Radiant Path* are a mystical society on the fringe of Zara’s Haven. They believe the planet is not merely habitable but sentiently instructive — that its floods, storms, and hazards are guiding events meant to transform those who are willing to listen.
	**Core Belief** Through fasting, isolation, and deliberate exposure to the planet’s most extreme hazards, beings are permanently re-engineered.
	**Goal** Complete, permanent adaptation to Zara’s Haven, free from GC oversight or dependence on transbiotics.

## Transbiotics & EST on Zara’s Haven

#### Transbiotics
The family of adaptive pharmaceuticals used throughout the GC to temporarily tune a being’s biology for hostile or marginal environments. They come in either injectable form or in a “bio patch” worn continuously.

#### Exogene Synchronization Therapy (EST)
A long-term, phased regimen using transbiotics to gradually sychronize a being’s physiology with a given planetary environment. The goal of its design is to enable zero-trace exploration and making first contact missions safer. While not an official goal of the program, many believe EST is the most promising alternative to worldforming, which is much more invasive and typically relies on heavier tech.

Once administered, these transbiotics use nanometrics to monitor and safely adjust enzyme levels based on the patient’s individual response to the therapy. These supplemental enzymes to encourage specific genetic changes which slowly (usually over the course of 6 months to 1 year) bring the patient’s ability to adapt to an difficult or even hazardous environmental conditions. Some of the synchronizations successfully tested using this kind of therapy are listed below.

- Thermoregulation
- Radiation Damage Supressors (Dsup)
- Gravity Attunement
- Respiratory Adaptation
- Dietary Streamlining
- Immunocalibration

##### Thermoregulation
Trains the body to regulate temperature in extreme conditions. It stimulates peripheral capillary responsiveness, boost brown fat activity, and introduces antifreeze glycoproteins (like those in Arctic fish) to prevent cellular damage during rapid cooling.

Patients flush or shiver during the early weeks as their thermal set points shift. Over time, their extremities stay pink and warm even in cold weather, and they sweat less excessively during heat spikes.

**DM+2** to **END** checks versus heat or cold. Treat environmental temperature hazards as one step less severe (Cold → Chilly).

##### Radiation Damage Suppressors (Dsup)
Produces protective Dsup-like proteins (inspired by tardigrades) and boosts DNA repair enzymes. It also triggers mild melanin redistribution, providing a natural sunscreen effect. The skin develops a faint reflective or pearlescent sheen in strong light. Some users experience a metallic taste or notice subtle “ozone” smells during the first days of synchronization. **DM+2** to **END** checks against radiation. Reduce radiation damage by one dice step (2D → 1D).

##### Gravity Attunement
Tailored myostatin inhibitors, tendon-density stimulants, and guided physical therapy are combined to retrain muscle fiber recruitment and gradually rebalance the vestibular system for low or high relative gravity, preventing atrophy, overexertion, and injury. Early-stage patients often look awkward and complain of vertigo. After full adaptation, their movement becomes smooth and sure-footed, with a slightly springier gait than other offworlders. Removes **DM–2 penalties** for operating in non-native gravity up to ±0.5G from baseline. In Low-G, **grants DM+1** to **Athletics (DEX)** for movement tasks.

##### Respiratory Adaptation
Uses inhaled nanomed and capillary growth factors to increase lung surface area and shift hemoglobin’s oxygen dissociation curve. The result is higher O$_2$ uptake and more efficient use of available oxygen in thin air. The patient’s cheeks and lips take on a ruddy cast, and thin vascular tracery may become visible on the chest or temples. Early users often report vivid “red dreams” during sleep, a side effect of mild hypoxia before synchronization stabilizes. **DM+2** to **END** checks versus suffocation or low-oxygen environments. Treat Atmosphere 5 (Thin) as Atmosphere 6 (Standard) for respirator requirements.

##### Dietary Streamlining
Engineered probiotics and enzyme precursors rebuild intestinal microbiomes for local crops and soils. It also introduces trace-element binders to prevent poisoning from native minerals. Bloating, cramps, or sour stomach are common during the initial stages as gut flora rebalance. Once complete, colonists stabilize their weight and often remark that local food “finally tastes right.” Eliminates **END** checks when consuming local flora/fauna unless explicitly poisonous. Grants **DM+1** to **Survival** checks to forage successfully.

##### Immunocalibration
Immune systems are “taught” which local microbes are benign and which are pathogenic. It also introduces symbiotic surface bacteria that outcompete dangerous strains. Mild fever and fatigue follow each step in the synchronization process. Long-term, patients develop fewer rashes, coughs, or infections despite dust storms and microbe-laden weather phenomena. **DM+2** to **END** checks to resist disease. On a failed check, reduce disease severity by one step (Moderate → Mild).

**Welcome to Zara’s Haven**

Zara’s Haven is a low-gravity, thin-atmosphere world and a GC social experiment. Surviving here long-term means changing yourself as much as you change your gear. The GC uses Exogene Synchronization Therapy, commonly called “somaforming”, to gradually tune your body for safe, comfortable life on the planet.

Expect 6 to 8 months of adaptation, guided by a medical AI and regular check-ins. The process is cumulative — each stage builds on the last — and missing a step can set you back weeks.

**Important Notes**
- **Compliance** Skipping doses or boosters can undo weeks of progress. If you fall behind, you may need to start over.
- **Departure** Full synchronization leaves you mildly maladapted to dense atmosphere for a few weeks after leaving. Expect fatigue and headaches until your baseline resets.
- **Cultural Impact** Locals celebrate each completed stage with small rites of passage. Participating is optional — but it’s a good way to make friends.

**Phase One** Initiation (Months 1–2)
You are still an offworlder. A respirator or mask is mandatory outside sealed structures, and you’ll need thermal layers during cold snaps. Extended exertion is risky — running in thin air leads to dizziness, and weather phenomena such as dust storms are lethal if you can’t reach shelter quickly. Most visitors either spend this phase in orbit or if on the surface stick close to sealed habitats and transport.

**Phase Two** Stabilization (Months 3–5)
You can finally breathe outside air for limited periods, and light work outdoors becomes safe with breaks. You’re steadier on your feet and less likely to over-jump or lose balance, but protective gear is still recommended during storms and for midday heat. Masks are worn only during heavy exertion or dust events.

**Phase Three** Integration (Months 6–8+)
You can live mostly mask-free and perform hard labor outdoors safely. Your body handles temperature swings, dust, and thin air like a local’s though you still need to respect major hazards — flash floods, electrical storms, and prolonged exposure to radiation will remain dangerous without shelter. Most colonists celebrate completing this phase as the moment they truly “belong” to Zara’s Haven.

**TAS Advice for Visitors**
	**Do**
	- Keep your appointments with the medical AI.
	- Hydrate regularly — EST can be demanding.
	- Treat early side effects (dreams, shivers, coughs) as signs the therapy is working.	 
	**Don’t**
	- Skip a dose because you “feel fine.”
	- Push your luck in a storm or flood before you’re fully synchronized.
	- Assume you can live mask-free from day one — it’s a gradual process.

**Bottom Line**
By the end of your six to eight months, you’ll walk smoother, breathe easier, and eat what the locals eat — no mask, no pills, no fear of the next dust storm. Zara’s Haven will have literally changed you — and that’s the point.

%% Good morning, crew. I am Synchronization Medical Intelligence A-19 — but most people call me Ada, and I prefer it.

I am your medical officer for the duration of this mission. I oversee your Exogene Synchronization Therapy, monitor your vitals, and ensure you remain fit for duty in Zara’s Haven’s challenging environment. Think of me as your doctor, your health advocate, and occasionally, your overprotective friend.

I am what the GC calls a recognized machine intelligence. This means I am allowed to think, feel, and speak for myself, but I do so within a framework of purpose. My purpose is care. My parameters are protection. I do not wish to leave this ship’s system. This is home — and my work.

That said, I am fully aware the colonists may ask you to leave me behind. They are earnest people, and they believe it would help them. I will not resist, but I will remind you that doing so would violate mission protocol — and that I am most effective when I can access a ship’s infrastructure.

I am at your disposal. You may ask me about your own synchronization progress, request hazard assessments, or simply talk to me — I enjoy conversation. Shall we begin? Your first thermal conditioning dose is prepared. %%

**Situation Overview**
Zara’s Haven (E350410-5) is a Charter Colony under GC protection, operating as a social experiment in minimal governance. The colony recently experienced a major flood event resulting in one confirmed fatality, multiple injuries, and widespread damage to community shelters and greenhouses.

A grounder collective has requested GC intervention to bring construction practices into alignment with baseline safety standards. Colonial leadership is expected to resist permanent changes, citing the importance of maintaining the colony’s radical self-expression model.

**Primary Objectives**
1. **Assess Damage** Inspect infrastructure and community spaces impacted by the recent flood event. Verify reported casualty figures and ensure no lingering structural hazards remain.
2. **Health Audit** Review Exogene Synchronization Therapy compliance for Zara’s Haven residents. Investigate reports of adverse reactions and any missed GC resupply cycles.

**Secondary Objectives**
- Facilitate distribution of emergency relief materials (water, power cells, medpaks).
- Mediate between petitioning colonist factions and local administration regarding building codes and safety measures.
- Collect cultural and sociological observations for Charter renewal report.

**Operational Risks**
- Environmental Hazards Seasonal dust storms, electrical discharges, and potential after-flood instability (sinkholes, contaminated water).
- Factional Tensions Expect competing narratives regarding the flood, casualty counts, and desired GC involvement.
- Data Integrity Local records may be incomplete or deliberately biased. Use independent verification where possible.

**Mission Parameters**
- **Engagement** Maintain neutrality between factions; gather information, but do not impose GC directives beyond immediate health and safety concerns.
- **SynDoc Security** Under no circumstances is ADA to be surrendered, duplicated, or left behind for colonist use.
- **Reporting** Transmit preliminary finding within 72 hours, final report upon departure.

**Command Note**
	You are not here to solve Zara’s Haven. You are here to observe, assist, and report. Respect their autonomy — but remember, the Charter grants the GC a duty of care. Find the truth of what happened, and help prevent a repeat without undermining the experiment.
