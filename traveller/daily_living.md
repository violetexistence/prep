Benedict Carrington, CEO of Carrington Shipping, testified on Hagarem today for the second time this standard. 

// Silent footage of a bored looking Solomani executive answering questions before a multi-species panel dressed in brightly colored clothing. An army of lawyers accompanies the executive. They confer before every one of his answers. //

This hearing was the seventh to date in Parliament's investigation into corrupt trading practices. While speculation continues as to the evidence behind this investigation, GC officials have so far declined to make official comment. Instead, vocal proponents of new radical policies continue to express concern.

//recorded interview//

> **Amber:** Governor, do you have information about the evidence obtained by Parliament?
>
> **Gov. Rahl:** I'm afraid the Galactic Commons doesn't share that kind of information with us.
> **Amber:** Don't you think your citizens deserve transparency? Don't you think they deserve the facts?
>  
> **Gov. Rahl:** These are the facts. There are 24 worlds in this main. 20 are members of the GC. A third of them are desert worlds. Almost a third have less than 10,000 population. 83% of those people live on G'Bradi. Another 17% live on Nova Paxis and Spire. The rest of the main is home to 0.25% of the population: just 174 million people across 21 planets. Asgard Station is one of only three starports capable of providing reliable enriched deuterium fuel to our fleets. It collects half of all revenues collected by the Star Port Authority in this sector.
> 
> **Amber:** What should we learn from these numbers, Governor?
> 
> **Gov. Rahl:** I'll share another fun fact. I doubt you'll get this kind of transparency from your sources on Hagarem.
> 
> **Amber:** What's that, Governor?
> 
> **Gov Rahl:** G'Bradi and Nova Paxis combined, this is both worlds mind you...receive less than nine percent per standard of funds allocated to this main.
> 
> **Amber:** Thank you for your time, Governor.
> 
> **Gov Rahl:** Thank you for listening.
> 
> **Amber:** Selena Rahl. Governor of Nova Paxis.

Here's another fun fact. There are 25 worlds in Hili Aubrug. I wonder which one she wasn't counting. 

That's all for now. Once again, this has been Amber Millhouser. Remember to like and subscribe. See you all again very soon in the...

When meeting an individual of another species for the first time, there is no sopont in the galaxy who does not immediately take inventory of xyr physiological differences. These are always the first things we see. How does xyr skin differ? Does xe have a tail? How does xe move? How does xe pick things up? What does xe eat? Does xe have abilities that I don’t? Or vice versa?

These are all important distinctions, but the more important comparison is the one we make  after this point. Once we’ve made our mental checklists of variations, we begin to draw parallels - not between the alien and ourselves, but between the alien and animals. The majority of us have been taught since childhood that voicing these comparisons is derogatory, and indeed, many of the racial slurs in colloquial use are nothing more than common names for nonsophont species (for example, the Human term lizard, to describe Aandrisks; the Quelin term tik, to describe Humans; the Aandrisk term sersh, to describe Quelin). Though these terms are offensive, examining them objectively reveals a point of major biological interest. All demeaning implications aside, we Aandrisks do look like some of the native reptilian species of Earth. Humans do look like larger, bipedal versions of the hairless primates that plague the sewer systems of Quelin cities. Quelin do bear some resemblance to the snapping crustaceans found all over Hashkath. And yet, we evolved separately, and on different worlds. My people and the lizards of Earth do not share an evolutionary tree, nor do Humans and tiks, nor Quelin and sersh. Our points of origin are spread out across the galaxy. We hail from systems that remained self-contained for billions of years, with evolutionary clocks that all began at different times. How is it possible that when meeting our galactic neighbors for the first time, we are all instantly reminded of creatures back home - or in some cases, of ourselves?

The question becomes even more complicated when we start to look beyond our superficial differences to the wealth of similarities. All sophonts have brains. Let us consider that seemingly obvious fact for a moment. Despite our isolated evolutionary paths, we all developed nervous systems with a central hub. We all have internal organs. We all share at least some of the same physical senses: hearing, touch, taste, smell, sight, electroreception. The grand majority of sapients have either four or six limbs. Bipedalism and opposable digits, while not universal, are shockingly common. We are all made from chromosomes and DNA, which themselves are made from a select handful of key elements. We all require a steady intake of water and oxygen to survive (though in varying quantities). We all need food. We all buckle under atmospheres too thick or gravitational fields too strong. We all die in freezing cold or burning heat. We all die, period.

How can this be? How is it that life, so diverse on the surface, has followed the same patterns throughout the galaxy - not just in the current era, but over and over again? We see this pattern in the ruins of the Arkanic civilization at Shessha, or the ancient fossil beds on the now-barren world of Okik. This is a question that scientific communities have wrestled with for centuries, and it seems unlikely that an answer will present itself in the near future. There are many theories - asteroids carrying amino acids, supernovae blowing organic material out into neighboring systems. And yes, there is the fanciful story of a hyperadvanced race of ancient sophonts “seeding” the galaxy with genetic material. I admit that the “Galactic Gardener” hypothesis has fueled the plots of some of my favorite science fiction sims, but scientifically speaking, it is nothing more than wishful thinking. You cannot have a theory without evidence, and there is absolutely none that supports this idea (no matter what the conspiracy theorists lurking on Linking feeds would have you believe).

For my part, I think that the best explanation is the simplest one. The galaxy is a place of laws. Gravity follows laws. The life cycles of stars and planetary systems follow laws. Subatomic particles follow laws. We know the exact conditions that will cause the formation of a red dwarf, or a comet, or a black hole. Why, then, can we not acknowledge that the universe follows similarly rigid laws of biology? We have only ever discovered life on similarly sized terrestrial moons and planets, orbiting within a narrow margin around hospitable stars. If we all evolved on such kindred worlds, why is it such a surprise that our evolutionary paths have so much in common? Why can we not conclude that the right combination of specific environmental factors will always result in predictable physical adaptations? With so much evidence staring us in the face, why does this debate continue?

The answer, of course, is that the laws of biology are nearly impossible to test, and scientists hate that. We can launch probes to test theories of gravity and space-time. We can put rocks in pressure cookers and split atoms in classrooms. But how does one test a process as lengthy and multifaceted as evolution? There are labs today that struggle to find the funding to keep a project running for three standards - imagine the funding needed to run a project for millennia! As it stands, there is no way for us to efficiently test the conditions that produce specific biological adaptations, beyond the most rudimentary observations (aquatic climates produce fins, cold climates produce fur or blubber, and so on). There have been bold attempts at creating software that could accurately predict evolutionary paths, such as the Aeluon-funded Tep Preem Project (which, though well-intentioned, has yet to unravel the mysteries of biological law). The problem with such endeavors is that there are too many variables to consider, many of which we remain ignorant of. We simply don’t have enough data, and the data that we do possess is still beyond our understanding.
                    
We are experts of the physical galaxy. We live on terraformed worlds and in massive orbital habitats. We tunnel through the sublayer to hop between stellar systems. We escape planetary gravity with the ease of walking out the front door. But when it comes to evolution, we are hatchlings, fumbling with toys. I believe this is why many of my peers still cling to theories of genetic material scattered by asteroids and supernovae. In many ways, the idea of a shared stock of genes drifting through the galaxy is far easier to accept than the daunting notion that none of us may ever have the intellectual capacity to understand how life truly works.

"Beautiful, isn't it?"

Judging by Kip's expression, he was making a valiant effort to be polite – or maybe he just really wanted that bean cake. "It's cool, yeah."

Isabel folded her hands in front of herself and continued to admire their surroundings.
Kip waited. He shuffled. He stopped waiting. "I’ve been down here before, M."

"I’m sure you have. School visit?"

"Yeah."

"Mmm. I’m sure you got a very technical explanation of how it all works, like I’m sure you did with water reclamation and engine tech and solar harvesters.’ She sighed. ‘Kip, what’s the most important cargo the Fleet carries?"

"Um . . . food?"

"Wrong."

He frowned. "Water. Air."

"Both wrong." She pointed to the racks. "This."

Kip was unconvinced. "We’d die without air, M."

"We die one way or another. That’s a given. What’s not is being remembered after the fact. To ensure that, you have to put in some effort." She reached out and touched one of the racks, feeling the warring balance of cold metal and warm energy. "Without this, we’re merely surviving. And that’s not enough, is it?" Isabel looked at the boy, who was still confused. She patted the rack and began to walk. "Our species doesn’t operate by reality. It operates by stories."

"Cities are a story. Money is a story. Space was a story, once. A king tells us a story about who we are and why we’re great, and that story is enough to make us go kill people who tell a different story. Or maybe the people kill the king because they don't like his story and have begun to tell themselves a different one. When our planet started dying, our species was so caught up in stories. We had thousands of stories about ourselves – that’s still true, don’t forget that for a minute – but not enough of us were looking at the reality of things. Once reality caught up with us and we started changing our stories to acknowledge it, it was too late." She looked around at all the lights, all the memories. "It is easy to remember that story here, in the Fleet. Every time you touch a bulkhead, every time you tend a garden, every time you watch the water in your hex’s cistern dip a little lower, you remember. You know what the story is here. But outside of here, there’s a different story. There’s sky. There’s ground. There are cities and money and water you can take for granted. Are you following?"

"Uh . . . I think so."

Isabel nodded and went on. "Comforts are not bad things, not by base. There’s nothing wrong with wanting to make life easier. The Gaiasts would have you think otherwise, but they’re also dying of diseases that can be easily cured and leaving imperfect infants out to freeze, so no, I don’t think technology is the greater evil here. The comforts we’ve invented - or that our neighbors have invented - can become bad if you don’t always, always ask what the potential consequences could be. Many of our people skip that step. Many - not all, but many - leave here and are too eager to change their story. There’s not just one planet with organic resources anymore. There are thousands. Hundreds of thousands. And if that’s true, you don’t need to worry so much, right? You don’t need to be so careful. Use one up and move on to the next. The Harmagians were like that, once, until the rest of the galaxy got tired of their story. They changed. They learned. And that’s why their society, and the Aandrisks, and the Aeluons, and everybody else - that’s why they look so appealing to us. We’re coming in at their happy ending and not stopping to think about how they got here. We want to take on their story. And we can, if we want to. But I worry about those who think adopting someone else’s story means abandoning their own." She turned to face the boy. "That’s why the theaters are here, Kip. That’s why we keep Archives, why we paint our hands on the wall. It’s so we don’t forget. We’re our own warning. That’s why the Fleet needs to remain. Why it has to remain. Without us out here, the grounders will forget within a few generations. We’ll become just another story, and not one that seems relevant. Sure, we broke Earth, but we won’t break this planet. We won’t poison this water. We won’t let this invention go wrong." She shook her head. "We are a longstanding species with a very short memory. If we don’t keep record, we’ll make the same mistakes over and over. I think it is a good thing that the Fleet is changing, that our people are spreading out. That’s what we were meant to do. That’s what our species has always, always done. But we must remember." She contemplated Kip, as if he were a file that needed categorizing. "What are your plans for the future? Have you chosen a profession yet?"

Kip shifted his weight. "I’m gonna leave the Fleet."

Isabel waited for some specificity. None came. "And do what?"

"I dunno."

"Where will you go?"

"I . . . I’m not sure."

"Are you going to university? Are you looking for work?" Isabel arched an eyebrow, "Surely, you're not thinking of enlisting..."

"I don’t know. I don’t know yet."

"Then why," Isabel asked without judgment, "do you want to go?"

Kip shrugged with agitation. "I just . . . I need to get out of here."
