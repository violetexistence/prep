Repair Todo List
* Tar, Glitchy Crane (difficult): Every time we have maintenance crews come in to look at it they can't repro.
* Doc, Monitors (difficult) for Cryo Pods loses signal. Sometimes it comes back on by itself. It always comes back if the pod temp computer is reset.
* ~~Blair, Coffee maker (easy) is complicated and the manual is translated from Hanto, badly.~~
* Me, there's a control panel (very difficult) in the crew mess who's function is unknown or if anyone says they know what it does, they actually don't.
* Phoebe, there's is a system alarm (routine) in main engineering that's too loud. Can we turn it down please? Thanks.
* Caro, the lift has a shudder (average). It's embarrassing when passengers use it. It jiggles the garnishes off the desserts.
* Customer, Mold in the shower passenger state room.
