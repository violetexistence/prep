**[Incoming Transmission from Aasgard Station]**

# ATTENTION: ALL INCOMING VESSELS
## Welcome to Aasgard Station!
We’re excited to have you here in orbit, but at the moment, we’re experiencing some minor system interruptions that have temporarily delayed docking availability. Our team is hard at work to resolve the issue, and we’ll be able to assign your berths as soon as possible. Your patience is greatly appreciated while we work through this.
## What you need to know
* ***Monitor comms channel 87-Kilo** for updates on docking and berth availability. We’ll keep you posted!
* Please maintain **standard holding orbit** and avoid non-essential comms traffic to ensure station bandwidth remains clear for updates.
* **Current estimated time to resolution: 2 Standard Days.**

In the meantime, we kindly ask all ships to review their **onboard safety protocols** and ensure fuel and life support systems are operating within standard limits. If you require emergency services, they remain available via priority comms on **channel 12-Echo.**

We’re working to get everything back online for you. **Remember, we're all in this together!**

1. **Fuel Injector System**: Possible recalibration needed after maintenance. The flow of deuterium or other hydrogen isotopes into the fusion reactor could be off, causing minor fluctuations in power output.

2. **Hydraulic Stabilizers**: Fine-tuning required for better control during landing and docking maneuvers, especially after the jump’s effect on the system.

3. **Reactor Coolant Systems**: Ensure cooling lines are clear and fully operational after maintenance to prevent any overheating risks.

4. **Jump Drive Calibration**: After the recent jump, small adjustments to the jump drive’s core matrix alignment may be necessary to ensure optimal performance.

5. **Navigation Computers**: Post-jump, navigation may need tweaking to realign sensors and ensure precise readings for future jumps and deep-space travel.

6. **Inertial Compensators**: Check for any drift in this system to ensure crew comfort during acceleration/deceleration and space maneuvers.

7. **Comm Array Boosters**: Communication signal strength might fluctuate; adjusting power levels or resetting the comm array could restore stable connections with nearby stations or starports.

8. **Life Support O2 Scrubbers**: Ensure scrubbers are functioning properly, filtering CO2 and generating a stable oxygen flow.

9. **Gravitic Stabilizers**: Minor tweaking may be needed to maintain consistent artificial gravity, especially if crew notices any shifts in gravitational force.

10. **Ventral Thrusters**: Fine-tuning required for smoother docking operations; thrusters may need balancing after maintenance.

11. **Airlock Seals**: Recheck seals on all airlocks to ensure no leakage or weakening in the integrity post-maintenance and jump.

12. **Power Distribution Systems**: Slight power imbalances may have developed during the jump. Balancing power output between critical systems could be required.

13. **Environmental Control Systems (Temperature/Atmosphere)**: Reset controls for ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure to maintain optimal comfort for the multi-species crew and passengers.

14. **Cargo Bay Grav-Plates**: May require recalibration after the jump to ensure cargo remains securely stowed.

15. **Auxiliary Engines**: Post-maintenance tuning, especially after a jump, to ensure the auxiliary engines are performing up to spec for precision maneuvers.
