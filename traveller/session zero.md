This is a story about people. It is not a story about epic events. In it we will follow the crew of the [ship] doing the work of bringing cargo and passengers to the worlds where they need to be. It is set in a universe that could be our own in the far future. The setting is speculative, grounded in science. It has a chewy, rebelliously optimistic center. It is not grimdark. Our characters will not revel in or succumb to despair. They are obstinate. They want to live and love. They use their incredible talents to explore who they are and build communities with safety and security for those they call their families. 

In this universe there are many sapient species. 

There is faster than light travel. 

The crew are human. Their ancestors were members of the Exodus Fleet.
