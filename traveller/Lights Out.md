# Jumpspace Event

***This event is startling but presents no actual danger, just inconvenience.***

There's a loud bang under the floor in Blair's cabin and the lights flicker then come back on in the red areas shown on the accompanying map. About ten seconds later there's a loud bang under the floor of the crew lounge, and the lights and power go out in the red and green areas. Battery powered emergency lights mounted in the corners of rooms come on automatically. There is no audible alarm in those areas but panels in engineering and on the bridge do light up and issue alerts indicating a non-critical-grid power failure in main deck sections port-3 and starboard-3.

First Clues:
* All other areas still have normal power and no main ship systems are affected.
* There is a carbonized smell in Blair's room coming from under the deck plate in the "northeast" corner.
* There is a carbonized smell coming from under a deck plate in the center of the crew lounge.

With Investigation the following is revealed:
The ship's non-critical electrical grid is split into sections, and each section has a "primary power unit" (PPU) - a box that draws electricity from the high-voltage lines that run the ship's major systems, and channels it to these lower-power normal everyday things. This is power for things like the overhead lights and galley appliances.

The affected area is two sections of the grid (port-3 and starboard-3) -- there is one PPU for each of these sections, one under Blair's cabin and another under Doc's cabin (symmetrically located). There is also an auxiliary power unit (APU) that covers both sections (located under the Crew lounge on the ship's centerline).

What happened: The PPU under Blair's cabin failed. This isn't a surprise; these units last many years but it happens sometimes. In this case the APU is supposed to take over and the PPU can be replaced or repaired. But... it turns out that the PPU under Doc's cabin had already failed a while back and was never repaired. So the APU was already supporting grid starboard-3. So when the Port-3 PPU failed and the APU had to support both sections, it overloaded and failed too. So now there are three power units in need of replacement.

Why did this happen: As best the investigating engineer can figure, someone (the previous engineer) didn't want to go through the hassle of replacing this PPU and just let the APU keep filling in for it.

Doc remembers the engineer having to come into his cabin last year to inspect some stuff under the floor, but after getting down there and checking it out they said it was fine and it never came up again.

To keep the failed PPU from being a constant maintenance alert (and probably to keep Tarin from hassling them about it), the engineer disabled the sensor on the PPU with some foil and a piece of gum. If we're being charitable they meant to get it replaced at the next annual maintenance, but by that time they were not aboard the ship any longer.

The Med Bay is unaffected because it has its own dedicated smaller PPU and battery in order to assure power for medical systems even in the event of this sort of failure.

The PPUs and APUs are essentially identical - a box the size of a dishwasher. There are two of them in spares back in engineering, so in order to get all three slots backfilled someone will have to repair one of the failed units (or rebuild one good one from the three broken units).

It's a time and labor-intensive job to replace them, as the units are unwieldy and heavy and the space they go into is a tight fit (probably why the old engineer didn't want to do it). You have to open up the floor plates, get down into the hole, disconnect the old unit and take out some other parts that are in the way of removing it. Set up an assembly over the hole to lift the unit up and set it onto a grav-pallet. Take that one to the spares bay, bring back the replacement and reverse the process.

Replacing each unit (old one out, new one in) is an Average (8+) Engineer (power) check (1Dx4 Hours, EDU).

Rebuilding/Repairing one of the units is either Routine (6+) Engineer (power) check (1Dx4 Hours, EDU or INT), or Average (8+) Mechanic check (1Dx4 Hours, EDU or INT).

All of these tasks can be rushed, of course.

An important decision will be whether Phoebe and Tarin will work together on each task to have a better chance of success, or split their efforts to make the total work go faster. Only someone with Engineering can work on the first task, but theoretically Doc (with Mechanic 0) could work on repairing the broken unit if he thinks of it or someone suggests it, and that would free up the Engineer folks for the other things.

Random inconveniences:

Blair and Doc will both be unable to sleep in their cabins while the unit under their floor is being replaced, so they have to sleep somewhere else for 1 or 2 nights depending how long it takes to do the job. This also means both Tarin and Phoebe will get a good look at the insides of those cabins. Where will these two sleep?

The crew will have to eat rations that don't need to be cooked since the galley has no power. And so will the passengers, if any. Of course it's possible for the engineers to run power to the galley appliances from elsewhere with a cable (very easy) but it will take 1D hours and that's time not spent fixing the real problem.
