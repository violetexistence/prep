The crew are contracted to deliver drilling equipment to a backwater system. They are not informed that local colonists have been "convinced" to sell at a low price due to legal claims made by the government in cooperation with a megacorp standing to profit. Security forces clash with protestors and the crew are caught in the middle.

Looking to buy middle/low passage are two of PWR's newest labor force. They are hoping to relocate and be accepted on one of the megacorp's high paying contracts for experienced drillers. Other opportunities have dissolved for this couple. They are running short on savings and getting this gig means a substantial step up in their income. Among the dreams they hope to explore are class 2 citizenship, a proper kitchen to prepare raw food, sending their adopted child to a school with advanced science training, and dedicated family housing - includes child care, other kids for that matter, free medical care. They are excited and hopeful.

### Keeping it Light
Think about the drama from 80s tv series, like Love Boat. It's okay to have characters be sad or even scared. The key is to center the ways characters cope with their feelings and how they work together to overcome what seem like intractable problems.

### Humor
Another way to keep things fun and light is HUMOR. Even when it's dark, laughing at it is always good!

Jane: Oh yeah, hiding behind the shepherd's skirt. That's manly scheme.
Mal: You want to run this ship?!
Jane: Yes!
Mal: ...well...you can't.
