# Galactic Commons
The **Galactic Commons** is a large and powerful multi-species alliance. Founded by the [Aeluon], [Harmagian] and [Aandrisk] species, it has since expanded to include many more.

It has a sort of *"European Union" of space* kind of vibe - bureaucratic, usually well-meaning and sometimes a plain hassle because of the legislation they enact or the decisions they make.

The GC Parliament is located on [Hagarem].

Parliament empowers many branches of civil bureaucracy, including the [Star Port Authority] which in addition to operating starports helps regulate trade between GC member worlds and sovereign trade partners.
## Founding
Following the Colonial Wars between the Harmagians, who had conquered much of charted space, and the Aeluons, a mutually beneficial agreement was struck, with the Harmagians providing wealth and the Aeluons providing firepower, while the Aandrisks were the diplomats who brokered the peace.

The Hashkath Accords were signed, which led to the Sapient Sovereignty Act coming into effect: this ordered all Harmagian-invaded homeworlds to be returned to their original inhabitants. Another important GC law is the Biodiversity Preservation Agreement, which declares it illegal to terraform planets where life is already present, so as not to disrupt the system's natural evolution.
## Member Species
In addition to Aandrisks, Harmagians and Aeluons, GC member species include:
* [Quelin]
* [Laru]
* [Exodans]
* [Solomani]
* [Sianat]

However, belonging to a member species does not automatically grant someone GC citizenship. You must be born or naturalized on a GC member world or protectorate to qualify.

Other species, such as [Akaraks] and [Grum], are present in GC space but not members of the Galactic Commons (the Akaraks applied for citizenship but eventually withdrew their application due to tensions between their species and the GC Parliament).
## Revised Common Code
The Revised Common Code or RCC is what is more commonly referred to as "GC Law". The behavior it is meant to govern is the behavior of its community within the shared space between starports. Outside the extrality line of a starport, the local government still retains its sovereignty. The GC does not interfere in the internal affairs of its member worlds. 

Things within the GC charter and therefore written into the RCC:
* Interstellar trade
* Armed starships
* Terraforming
* Citizenship
* Relations with uncommon sovereignties

# Port Coriol
**Port Coriol** (C482722-C), or "the Port", is a bustling multispecies on the bright side of Coriol, a tidally-locked planet in GC space. It is a major trade hub of the [Hili Aubrug](https://discord.com/channels/1244384807283069119/1281039539925680199) main.
## World
Coriol is tidally locked with its star. This means that it has a permanent bright and dark side. Environmental enclosures allow permanent settlements, especially on the bright side, survive constant exposure to solar radiation. 

Coriol has two continents. Its oceans, which cover most of the moon, are capped by thick algae mats. Only 20% of the surface has navigable or usable ocean.

An estimated 10^7 (tens of millions) sophonts inhabit Coriol.
## Settlements and Districts
- **Port Coriol,** on the bright side, is the bustling main docking site and home to the markets.
- **Tessara Cliffs** is a wealthy district on Coriol's dark side, home to well-to-do ship dealers and fuel merchants.
- **Kukkesh** is the dark side's [Aandrisk] district.
- **Flatrock Road**, colloquially known as The Bruise, is a low tech slum that has evolved in the twilight zone of Coriol. It flanks an ancient bicycle trail that circumnavigates the planets surface.
- **Sixtop** is the dark side's modder district. [Modders] have modified biology/genetics, often done before their birth by their parents or their society.
- **Northwest Window** the artist district.
## The Undersea
The Undersea Transit Line, commonly referred to as "the Undersea", connects Coriol's two continents. It was designed by Sianats. The journey under the ocean from the Port to Sixtop takes a little over an hour.
## The Markets
Port Coriol's markets consist of streets filled with open-air shopfronts. There are numerous junk heaps and grounded ships that have been emptied and transformed into warehouses and eateries.

The markets of the Port are described as 'anything but corporate'. The colony has an anything-goes attitude which appeals to some, while others find it distasteful. While the Port has a laid-back approach to what business occurs in the markets, those that challenge port authority aren't allowed to continue said business. Due to the carefully-managed state of black-market affairs, the marketplace is far from riddled with crime. Illegal activities are limited to low-stake scams which target more gullible visitors.
## The Tech District
The underground marketplace, also known as 'The Caves', is home to a community of tech enthusiasts - many of whom are modders. The shops that are situated there focus on the buying and selling, exchanging, and repairing of technological goods. An example of one of these shops is The Rust Bucket, run by [contact].
