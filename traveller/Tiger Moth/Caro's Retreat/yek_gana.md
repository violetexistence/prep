Yek Gana’s Story: “The Garden that Sang”

Yek Gana’s cheeks shimmer with a faint iridescent glow as xe gazes at the gathered artists, xyr voice soft but resonant in the quiet of the retreat’s lounge.

“On the Fleet, we measure time not by suns or seasons, but by cycles of necessity. And yet, there are moments that transcend this practicality. Long ago, aboard the Ess’kesh, one of our homesteader ships, there was a garden in the heart of the ship that did not need to exist. It was not for food, nor air, nor study. It was built entirely out of memory—plants preserved from Earth, kept alive by care and love. For generations, it was tended by a family who passed the task down like a sacred promise, even as the garden dwindled, even as new growth failed.

“But one day, as the ship approached a nebula to harvest plasma, the vibrations from the engines began to resonate with the hull. The crew braced for structural concerns, but instead, they heard something no one expected: the garden began to sing. Not from voices or machines, but from the leaves, the stems, the very space around them. Somehow, the resonance found its way into every crevice of that dying place, making it bloom again—not with life, but with sound. The family who had cared for the garden knelt together, overwhelmed. For a moment, in the cold quiet of the void, they heard the voice of Earth itself.”

Xe pauses, letting the weight of the memory settle over the room.

“When the Fleet changes, we carry these moments forward, even if they no longer make sense in a world of ground and sky. This garden no longer exists, but its song remains in our Archives, waiting for anyone who needs to hear it.”
