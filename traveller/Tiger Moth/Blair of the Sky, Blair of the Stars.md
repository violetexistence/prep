**“Blair of the Sky, Blair of the Stars”**

_(Upbeat, lively tune with a catchy chorus)_

**Verse 1**
Oh, she came from the stars, with her pockets so light,
But her heart was as big as the Nova’s bright night.
A hundred? A thousand? Who could say what she gave,
But the children all cheered, their future she’d save.

**Chorus**
Blair of the sky, Blair of the stars,
She gave us the music, she played on guitars!
With quarlite and kindness, she made us a way,
To dance through the night and sing through the day.

**Verse 2**
The Harmagians whispered, “Let’s match it tenfold,”
And soon her small gift turned to rivers of gold.
Her name on the banners, her face on the walls,
Now every child sings of Blair in the halls.

**Chorus**
Blair of the sky, Blair of the stars,
She gave us the music, she played on guitars!
With quarlite and kindness, she made us a way,
To dance through the night and sing through the day.

**Verse 3**
So gather your flutes, your strings, and your drums,
Thanks to dear Blair, the festival comes.
A hero she is, though she’d humbly deny,
But we’ll sing her name loud, up high in the sky!

**Chorus**
Blair of the sky, Blair of the stars,
She gave us the music, she played on guitars!
With quarlite and kindness, she made us a way,
To dance through the night and sing through the day.

As the _Tiger Moth_ crew walks through Aasgard Station, Blair’s face on the banners and holographic displays isn’t just promoting her as a benefactor—it’s tied into a significant cultural moment for Nova Paxis. The Children’s Music Initiative she supposedly sponsored is part of an annual celebration called **“The Voice of Tomorrow,”** a holiday created post-reformation to honor the resilience of the planet’s inhabitants and their commitment to ensuring that future generations don’t repeat the mistakes of the past.

Nova Paxis, having experienced its environmental recovery and ongoing industrial reformation, has a deep cultural emphasis on youth, education, and community engagement. “The Voice of Tomorrow” symbolizes the planet’s hope for the future, and supporting arts, especially music, is seen as a key part of helping children connect with their world and each other.
