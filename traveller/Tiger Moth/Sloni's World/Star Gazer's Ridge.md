### **Set the Scene**
The climb up to **Star Gazer’s Ridge** is a peaceful, invigorating journey, with the **Floating Gardens** and **Sloni’s World** stretching out beneath the ridge. As dusk begins to settle, the serene beauty of the landscape contrasts with a subtle tension in the air. Guests who make the hike are greeted by **Roevek**, a Quelin exile, and offered a warm cup of locally brewed tea. 

However, it becomes quickly apparent that all is not well with Roevek. The normally meditative stargazing ceremony is under threat. The **star mapping system**, an old but reliable piece of machinery, is malfunctioning, and it’s obvious that Roevek is stressed and overworked. As the players arrive, **Merritah**, an ambitious Aeluon event director, hovers nearby, placing subtle but constant pressure on Roevek to fix the problem immediately, as the star mapping is a key feature of the guest experience. 

### **Call to Action**
As the players observe the situation, they will notice the conflict between Merritah’s demands and Roevek’s fatigue. The star mapping system’s glitch is relatively minor, but Roevek is exhausted, his typical problem-solving capabilities worn thin. It’s clear that he’s been working too hard, driven both by Merritah’s expectations and his own desire to prove himself. 

The players have the opportunity to step in and assist with the technical issue, but the real challenge is addressing the larger issue—Roevek’s well-being—and navigating the dynamic between the stressed Quelin and the event director who seems more concerned with guest satisfaction than her staff’s rest.

### **The Glitch**
The **star mapping system** is a mechanical device that tracks the stars and projects a simplified display for the guests. Dust and debris have accumulated in the gears and joints, causing the system to malfunction. Normally, this would be an easy fix for Roevek, but the cumulative stress of managing the system day after day has taken its toll on him. 

The glitch is emblematic of a deeper problem: the system is old and was designed for fewer guests. Roevek knows how to fix it, but Merritah’s constant oversight and pressure are making him second-guess himself.

*Mechanics:* The players can use **Mechanic** (difficulty **Routine 6+**) or **Electronics** (difficulty **Average 8+**) to repair the gears. **Recon** (difficulty **Routine 6+**) can be used to spot the blockage in the system. Alternatively, the players can attempt to de-escalate the situation with **Diplomat** (difficulty **Average 8+**) to smooth tensions between Merritah and Roevek.

**Exceptional Success:** The system is repaired perfectly, and Merritah is pleased with the outcome, but more importantly, Roevek gains a moment of peace and appreciation for the players’ intervention.
**Success:** The glitch is fixed, the ceremony proceeds, but Roevek remains tense. The players will need to address his well-being directly if they want to make a real impact.
**Failure:** The system remains broken, leading to a compromised experience for the guests. Merritah becomes increasingly demanding, and Roevek feels even more defeated.

### **Merritah (Aeluon, she/her)**

- **Background:**  
  Merritah is an Aeluon event director with a focus on creating premium experiences for offworld guests. She was brought to **Sloni’s World** to manage the eco-tourism efforts, and while she’s highly competent and organized, she tends to focus on results more than the well-being of her staff. Having been raised in a competitive, status-conscious environment, she feels enormous pressure to prove her value, especially on a low-tech world that feels far removed from the high standards of Sohep Frie.

- **Appearance:**  
  Merritah’s silver skin glows faintly under the evening light, and the iridescent patches on her cheeks flash in frustration when things go wrong. She is impeccably dressed for the rustic surroundings, a walking advertisement for efficiency and professionalism, with a data pad always in hand.

- **Personality:**  
  Merritah is driven by a desire to succeed and to be seen as indispensable. She’s polite, but her tone can be clipped, especially when she’s anxious about a situation. Though she genuinely believes she’s doing what’s best for the guests and the business, she often overlooks the needs of her team in the process. She doesn’t have bad intentions, but her fixation on getting things done blinds her to the stress she causes others.

- **Motivation:**  
  Merritah wants the stargazing ceremony to be a flawless success, as it’s a highlight of the guest experience. She’s under pressure from her superiors to ensure that everything goes perfectly, and she’s hyper-focused on making sure that every detail is in place. Her anxiety about her performance often leads her to micromanage, much to the frustration of her staff.

### **Roevek (Quelin, he/him)**

- **Background:**  
  Roevek is a Quelin exile, cast out from his society after a relationship with a human genetic researcher was discovered. The researcher had cloned DNA, which is strictly prohibited in Quelin society after a civil war was fought using cloned soldiers. Now marked by his exile, the grooves where polished stones once adorned his exoskeleton are bare—a constant reminder of his separation from his people. Roevek found a semblance of peace on Sloni’s World, but his isolation has taken a toll on him.

- **Personality:**  
  Roevek is introverted, his exile having forced him into a life of solitude. He feels conflicted—torn between his love for his human partner and his resentment toward the Galactic Commons for the technology that led to the civil war in the Protectorate. Though polite, his interactions with others are brief, and he often avoids deep conversation. Beneath his reserved exterior is someone who still longs for connection, though he’s unsure how to reach for it anymore.

- **Motivation:**  
  Roevek’s primary motivation is to find peace and balance. However, Merritah’s constant pressure has made him doubt his abilities, and the players will need to navigate the delicate balance between helping Roevek reclaim his confidence and defusing the tension caused by Merritah’s demands.

### **The Tea Ceremony**
The tea ceremony at **Star Gazer’s Ridge** is meant to be a moment of peace for guests, an opportunity to relax and reflect on the natural beauty of the stars above. The tea includes **serresh leaf** and **lumari bark**, both native to **Sloni’s World**, known for their calming effects. The tea is brewed in small batches and served to the guests as they wait for the stars to align.

However, with the star mapping system glitching and Roevek’s stress evident, the ceremony feels off balance. Merritah’s hovering presence only adds to the tension, and the guests pick up on the unease in the air.

**Details on the Botanicals:**
- **Serresh leaf:** A bitter, grounding herb that is known for its calming properties.
- **Lumari bark:** Adds a slight sweetness to the tea and is used to treat mild stress and fatigue.

### **Choice**
The players will face a key choice:  
- **Intervene with Merritah’s demands:** Diplomatically helping Merritah understand the need for Roevek to rest may relieve some of the pressure and allow Roevek to regain his footing. This could lead to a more harmonious evening for the guests.
- **Assist Roevek directly:** Helping Roevek solve the technical problem quickly will remove Merritah’s immediate concerns, but may not address the deeper issue of Roevek’s burnout.

**Impact on the Festival:**  
If the players resolve the conflict in a way that restores Roevek’s confidence and balances Merritah’s demands, Roevek will play a key role in the festival preparations, and the star mapping system will provide a flawless celestial display during the event. If the players merely solve the problem without addressing the interpersonal tensions, Roevek will remain on the periphery, still struggling to find his place in the community.

---

### **Emotional Subtext**
Roevek’s story is one of overwork, burnout, and the desire for rest. Merritah’s demands reflect the pressures of high performance and guest satisfaction, but her inability to see the toll it takes on others puts Roevek in a precarious situation. The players have an opportunity to bring balance to this dynamic, offering Roevek the rest and support he desperately needs while also reminding Merritah of the importance of compassion in leadership.
