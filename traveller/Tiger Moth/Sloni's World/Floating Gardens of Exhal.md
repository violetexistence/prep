### **Floating Gardens Encounter**

#### Set the Scene
The **Floating Gardens** of **Sloni’s World** are a breathtaking sight. Hydroponic platforms covered in lush greenery drift gently on a tranquil lake, kept afloat by an ingenious combination of ancient Harmagian irrigation systems and modern Exodan hydroponic techniques. Towering trees, vibrant flowers, and rare plants flourish in this serene environment, their roots suspended in water rather than soil. 

The gardens are tended by an eclectic group of caretakers who are as diverse as the plants themselves. As the crew of **Tiger Moth** wanders through the paths, guided by **Lana Serrikesh** (Aandrisk, she/her), the gentle hum of water pumps and the sweet, earthy smell of the garden blend with the sound of trickling water. **Lana** explains that the crown jewel of the garden is the **Orbal Bloom**, a rare and revered flower that blooms only once every few decades. This elusive bloom is due to open soon, and the community is preparing a festival to celebrate the event.

However, as the crew moves deeper into the garden, they overhear a heated argument between **Old Mak’tan** (Harmagian, he/him) and **Wesker** (Human, he/him). Standing over a malfunctioning irrigation system, the two are clearly at odds about how to address a pressing issue with the water flow.

#### Call to Action
The irrigation system is malfunctioning, causing improper drainage in one of the key sections of the garden. This problem, if left unchecked, could damage the delicate plants and disrupt the garden’s ecosystem—most notably, the **Orbal Bloom**.

**Mak’tan** insists the solution is simple: clear the blockage manually, as they always have in the past, using traditional tools and techniques. He scoffs at the idea of bringing in technology, arguing that the plants are best left to their natural rhythms. **Wesker**, on the other hand, is pushing for a more modern solution. He believes the pump should be upgraded, bypassing the outdated system and installing a cutting-edge hydroponic pump that he’s been advocating for. The situation is tense, and **Lana** is visibly torn between the two approaches, unsure of how to mediate. 

Seeing the crew, **Lana** turns to them for help, hoping they can resolve both the immediate problem and calm the growing tension between **Mak’tan** and **Wesker**.

#### Initial Problem
The irrigation system is clogged with debris and plant matter, causing water to back up and the pump to grind. Without proper water flow, the plants are already showing signs of stress, and the **Orbal Bloom** could be in jeopardy if the problem isn’t resolved soon.

- **Mak’tan’s Solution**: **Mak’tan** suggests manually clearing the debris using traditional methods, which would involve going into the root system and unclogging the flow by hand. He’s convinced this will work, as it always has, and resists any attempt to involve technology.
  
- **Wesker’s Solution**: **Wesker** believes the pump is outdated and beyond repair. He suggests they replace it with a more efficient hydroponic system developed using Exodan techniques. This would involve rerouting some of the existing channels but would ensure smoother water flow in the long term.

#### Choice: Initial Irrigation Issue
The crew must decide how to approach the problem with the irrigation system:
1. **Support Mak’tan**: Help clear the blockage manually using traditional methods.
   - **Average Task**: (Mechanic, Survival, or Athletics 8+)
   - Success: The blockage is cleared, and the water flow is restored without needing technological intervention. **Mak’tan** is pleased, though **Wesker** remains frustrated.
   - Failure: The blockage worsens, causing more damage to the system. **Mak’tan** grows more stubborn, and **Wesker** begins to lose patience.
   - **Exceptional Failure**: The blockage spreads further, affecting another part of the garden and deepening the rift between the two caretakers.

2. **Support Wesker**: Help install the modern hydroponic system to replace the failing pump.
   - **Average Task**: (Electronics, Engineer, or Science 8+)
   - Success: The hydroponic system is installed successfully, and the water flow improves. **Wesker** is thrilled, though **Mak’tan** is clearly displeased with the technological intrusion.
   - Failure: The new system encounters complications, causing the garden’s water flow to become even more erratic.
   - **Exceptional Success**: The hydroponic upgrade not only solves the immediate problem but enhances the overall system’s efficiency, impressing both **Wesker** and **Mak’tan**.

#### Return to the Tour & the Festival’s Centerpiece
After resolving the irrigation problem, the group returns to the tour. However, **Lana** is visibly anxious, and eventually confesses her deeper concern: the upcoming festival, centered around the blooming of the **Orbal Bloom**. The recent irrigation issues have only added to her stress, and she worries that the Bloom won’t open in time for the festival, which would be a cultural disaster.

**Mak’tan** believes that the Bloom should be left to nature. He warns against meddling, saying that the Bloom has survived on its own for centuries. **Wesker**, however, sees this as an opportunity to apply the Exodan-developed **Microbial Soil Pods**—small, controlled environments that can enrich soil with the necessary nutrients and microorganisms to help ensure the Bloom’s survival. 

This sets up the larger choice: does the crew trust in tradition or intervene with modern technology?

### **Cultural and Scientific Details of the Orbal Bloom**

- **Cultural Significance**: The **Orbal Bloom** is more than just a rare flower; it is a symbol of the balance between nature, tradition, and life on **Sloni’s World**. The bloom is tied to ancient stories of regeneration and renewal, and its opening is said to signal a time of peace and prosperity. Traditionally, the Bloom has been left to its own natural cycles, revered as a representation of patience and faith in the world’s rhythms. It’s become a cultural touchstone for the community, with many believing that any intervention would break the sacred bond between the Bloom and the land.

- **Scientific Details**: On the scientific side, **Wesker** explains that the **Orbal Bloom** thrives in an extremely delicate environment. While the garden itself is hydroponic, the **Bloom** requires specific soil conditions to survive. The **Microbial Soil Pods** developed by Exodans are a fascinating innovation, designed to introduce a controlled mix of microorganisms into the soil. These pods replicate the soil balance found in the Bloom’s natural habitat, ensuring that the plant receives the nutrients it needs while maintaining a healthy balance of water, minerals, and microorganisms. The pods themselves are biodegradable, breaking down over time and enriching the soil even further, which **Wesker** believes will help the Bloom open in time for the festival.

#### Bigger Choice: Orbal Bloom
Now, the crew faces the larger decision:
1. **Trust Tradition**: Support **Mak’tan** in leaving the Bloom to its natural cycle, without intervention.
   - **Average Task**: (Survival, Medic, or Science 8+)
   - Success: The Bloom opens naturally, much to **Mak’tan’s** delight, and the festival is a grand success.
   - Failure: The Bloom doesn’t open in time, causing disappointment. However, **Mak’tan** remains stoic, reminding **Lana** that nature follows its own course.
   - **Exceptional Failure**: The Bloom wilts, causing a sense of loss among the garden’s caretakers.

2. **Use Modern Technology**: Support **Wesker** in using the **Microbial Soil Pods** to help the Bloom open in time.
