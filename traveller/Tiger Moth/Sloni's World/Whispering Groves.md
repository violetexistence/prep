### **Phases of the Encounter**

1. **Entry into the Grove:**
   - *As you step deeper into the grove, the sounds of the outside world fade, replaced by the rhythmic rustling of leaves overhead. The ground beneath your feet is soft, covered in a thin layer of moss that muffles your footsteps. Sunlight filters through the canopy above, casting the forest in shifting patterns of light and shadow. The air is cool, and with each breath, you feel a weight lifting from your shoulders, as though the grove itself is inviting you to leave your burdens behind.*

2. **The Whispers Begin:**
   - *The rustling of the leaves grows louder, and you begin to hear faint whispers in the wind. These whispers aren’t voices, but suggestions—fragments of words, emotions, or sensations that seem to speak directly to your heart.*
     - **Examples of Whispers:**  
       - *“Why do you carry it still?”*  
       - *“Release what weighs you down…”*  
       - *“The past cannot follow you here…”*  
       - *“Breathe… let it go…”*

3. **The Heart of the Grove:**
   - *The trees grow taller and denser as you move deeper into the forest. Their branches intertwine like hands clasped in quiet communion. The breeze carries more than just the rustle of leaves; it carries a sense of something watching, waiting. The whispers become more resonant, seeming to ask questions, encouraging you to reflect on something personal.*
     - **Personalized Whispers:**  
       - *“You’ve carried this long enough…”*  
       - *“It’s time to choose…”*  
       - *“What do you truly seek?”*  
       - *“You are not alone…”*

4. **The Whispering Stones:**
   - *Eventually, you arrive at a small clearing where ancient stones rise from the ground. Smooth and dark, they stand like sentinels among the trees. The air here feels charged with an unspoken energy, as if the stones themselves are waiting for you to add your mark to their long history.*

   - *As you step closer, you see that each stone bears the carvings of countless travelers who came before you—some old and weathered, others fresh and sharp. The variety of symbols speaks to the diversity of those who have visited this place: different species, different lives, all united by the act of leaving something behind.*

   - **Past Visitors' Offerings:**  
     - *A small heart carved deep into the stone, the work of a careful Aeluon hand: “For the one I lost but never forgot.”*
     - *A spiral etched by a Harmagian, with deep grooves in the stone: “All journeys lead home, even when they twist and turn.”*
     - *Two sets of initials encircled by an infinity symbol, left by a couple—likely Aandrisk or Exodan: “We were here, together, and that’s what matters.”*
     - *A simple star, shakily carved by a Laru child: “I wish to touch the stars one day.”*
     - *An elegant feather, etched with care by an Aandrisk artisan: “May the weight of my burdens be as light as this.”*
     - *A small tree, carved by a heavy-handed Quelin: “Growth.”*
     - *A sun and moon symbol linked by a curved line, meticulously etched by an Aeluon: “We’ll always find each other, day or night.”*
     - *An intricate wave pattern, likely created by a Human spacer: “I’ve learned to ride the waves instead of fighting them.”*
     - *A rough handprint left by an Exodan: “I leave behind my fears.”*
     - *A delicate circle of stars, finely carved by a Sianat Pair: “You are never alone in the darkness.”*

   - *These marks, and many others, tell the story of travelers who have come before—beings from all corners of the galaxy, each leaving behind a part of themselves. You are invited to do the same: to carve your own symbol, a memory or burden, a wish or hope, and leave it in the care of the forest.*

   - **Activity Prompt:**  
     Encourage the players to leave their own marks on the stones—whether a symbol, a word, or a silent prayer. The act of carving into the stone is more than just a ritual; it is an offering to Sloni’s spirit and a way to release something they have carried for too long.

   - **Whispers as They Carve:**  
     - *“What will you leave behind?”*  
     - *“This is a place of peace…”*  
     - *“You are free here…”*

5. **The Spirit’s Song:**
   - *As you finish your offerings, the breeze picks up once more, and the rustling of the leaves above transforms into a gentle melody. It’s as if the forest is singing—a soft, haunting song that seems to touch the deepest parts of your soul. The music is beautiful and melancholic, filling you with both a sense of peace and a sense of longing.*

   - *You feel the presence of something greater than yourself—the spirit of the land, the whispers of those who have walked these paths before you, and the quiet wisdom of the trees.*

   - **Environmental Prompt:**  
     The song of the forest may stir memories, dreams, or long-buried emotions. Encourage the players to take a moment to sit in silence, listening to the melody, and letting the peace of the grove wash over them.

   - **Final Whisper:**  
     - *“Rest now… and rise anew…”*

### **Conclusion**
The **Whispering Stones** are not just monuments to past travelers—they are a place where every visitor can leave a piece of themselves, joining the silent conversation that spans across time and species. This encounter provides a profound opportunity for players to engage with their characters’ internal struggles and connect to something larger than themselves, guided only by the whispers of the forest.
