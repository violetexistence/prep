### **Set the Scene**
The Artisan Village is normally a peaceful place, full of creativity and laughter, where villagers share stories, craft, and food. The distant hum of looms blends with the sound of wood being carved, and the smell of kilns and fresh clay fills the air. Today, however, a storm looms on the horizon, and the idyllic scene is being rapidly replaced with hurried activity as everyone prepares for the coming squall.

As the villagers secure their homes and businesses, there’s a growing buzz of frustration: a **storm lantern**, essential for lighting the village during the downpour, has gone missing. This isn’t the first time something’s gone “missing” right before a storm. Some of the older artisans roll their eyes and mutter something about “the borrowers” striking again, while the younger ones treat it like an amusing legend. The truth is a bit harder to pin down, but one thing’s for sure—someone or something always seems to borrow things when a storm is coming, and they never seem to ask permission.

Little do they know, the missing lantern is currently in the hands of **Sheeka** and her small family of **Ohta'wa**, huddled in a secret nook just outside the village. To them, the lantern is not just a light, but a lifeline in the storm—especially for **Talli**, the adventurous youngster who’s always getting into trouble. Without it, Talli may get lost in the storm, but with it, Sheeka risks the discovery of her family by the curious (and nosy) villagers.

### **Call to Action**
The storm is closing in, and the village is bustling with last-minute preparations. The crew of the **Tiger Moth** can easily find themselves swept up in the activity, either helping to tie down loose materials, gathering supplies, or just enjoying the warm company of the villagers—until they hear about the missing lantern. 

The gossip about the “borrowers” might seem like harmless village talk, but the crew knows there’s always more to a story like this. Their curiosity piqued, they may find themselves drawn into the search for the lantern, with a decision looming: follow the mystery or stay out of it? Their choice could affect more than just the village—it could mean life or loss for the Ohta'wa family hiding just outside the walls.

### **Choice**
1. **Investigate the Missing Lantern**: The crew can choose to follow the trail of the missing lantern, which leads them to the Ohta'wa’s hidden shelter. If they investigate, they can choose to:
   - **Intervene Quietly**: Help the Ohta'wa family stay hidden and ensure they keep the lantern. Talli is safe, the family stays out of sight, and the villagers remain none the wiser. This path keeps the cozy balance, with the crew slipping in and out of the shadows like helpful “borrowers” themselves.
   - **Intervene Openly**: Return the lantern to the village, but negotiate a peaceful compromise between the villagers and the Ohta'wa. This exposes the family but could lead to a new understanding. It’s a heartwarming chance to bring two different groups together and demonstrate that no matter your size, everyone has a place in the community.

2. **Leave It Be**: The crew can also choose to do nothing, trusting that the Ohta'wa know how to take care of themselves. In this case, the family stays hidden, but Talli is tragically lost in the storm. The crew’s choice to stay uninvolved may save the family from exposure, but the cost is high, and the players might have to reckon with the consequences of inaction.

### **Tasks**
- **Recon or Investigate (Routine 6+)**: Following the small trail of clues leading to the Ohta'wa’s hidden nook, such as tiny footprints, a faint glow in the distance, or cleverly used cover.
- **Diplomat or Persuade (Difficult 10+)**: Convincing the villagers to let go of the missing lantern or negotiating a peaceful compromise if the family is discovered. Villagers might grumble about their things being “borrowed,” but some are open to understanding once they see what’s really at stake.
- **Stealth (Average 8+)**: Assisting the Ohta'wa without being seen by the villagers. This could involve distracting curious artisans or making a quick switcheroo to replace the lantern with another light source.
- **Mechanic or Engineer (Routine 6+)**: If the players decide to offer a creative solution, such as repairing another lantern or finding another way to help the Ohta'wa stay lit during the storm.

### **NPC Details**

#### **Sheeka (Mother, Resourceful and Protective)**
- **Personality:** Sheeka’s no stranger to storm preparations, but she’s tired of always hiding in the shadows. She’s the glue holding her family together, fiercely protective of her children, and determined to keep them safe through the storm, even if it means taking risks.
- **Motivation:** She wants to protect her family while remaining hidden. But deep down, she dreams of a day when they won’t have to borrow from the villagers just to survive.

#### **Rokkel (Father, Quiet and Industrious)**
- **Personality:** Rokkel is a man of few words but many skills. He’s always building or fixing something, keeping the family’s shelter in top shape. He doesn’t want to cause trouble with the villagers but will do what’s needed to protect his family.
- **Motivation:** Support Sheeka and keep their family together. He’s starting to wonder if staying hidden forever is the right choice.

#### **Talli (Young Inventor, Adventurous)**
- **Personality:** Talli is bursting with energy and curiosity, always eager to explore the world beyond the family’s hidden nook. Sheeka tries to keep them close, but Talli always finds ways to slip away. Talli sees the villagers as fascinating and would love nothing more than to learn from them.
- **Motivation:** Talli wants to explore, and is excited by the larger world. They’re also not great at staying put, which is why the lantern is so vital—they need it to guide their way if they get lost in the storm.

#### **The Storm**
The storm sweeps in with heavy rain and fierce winds. The villagers are used to such weather, but Sheeka’s family, without the benefits of a larger community, are far more vulnerable. The lantern they’ve borrowed is the only thing keeping their nook illuminated, and without it, Talli could be lost to the chaos of the storm.

### **Emotional Stakes**
The emotional stakes lie in whether the crew decides to intervene and help the Ohta'wa, risking exposure but offering the chance for a heartwarming resolution. Or do they keep their hands off, leaving Sheeka’s family to their own devices, potentially leading to loss but also keeping them safely hidden?

It’s a cozy but complex moment, where every choice matters—not just for the outcome of the encounter but for the relationships formed along the way. 

### **Tiger Moth Vibe**
This encounter balances the **Tiger Moth**'s signature cozy tone with moments of quiet reflection. The crew has a real chance to make a difference, not through grand heroics, but by offering help where it's needed most, even if it’s as simple as making sure a family of “borrowers” makes it through the storm. There’s a sense of warmth here, even as the storm rages outside. The village is a place of community, whether it’s made up of big people or small—and by the end of the adventure, the crew can leave knowing they’ve helped something beautiful endure.

### **Festival Impact**
If the crew helps Sheeka’s family, they may catch glimpses of them watching the festival from the shadows, enjoying the festivities in their own way. If the villagers are made aware of the Ohta'wa, they might even invite the family to participate in the festival—though the family will remain cautious, unsure of whether the village is truly ready to welcome them.

The festival may include a heartfelt moment where the village raises a lantern in the storm's aftermath—a symbol of the light that guides even the smallest among them.
