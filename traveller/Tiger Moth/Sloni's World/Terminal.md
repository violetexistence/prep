# Shattered Silence and the Mystery of Vyros’ Disappearance

#### **Set the Scene:**

The **Terminal** is a beautifully repurposed space within what was once a colonial shipping port. What was once a conduit for offworld shipments of raw resources has been transformed into a vibrant art and cultural center, showcasing **Sloni’s World**’s rich history and contemporary creativity. Visitors stroll through exhibits that display indigenous artifacts, relics from the colonial era, and modern ecological art installations that symbolize the planet's ongoing restoration and renewal.

One of the most anticipated pieces in the gallery is **Shattered Silence**, an intricate, living installation created from a mix of vines, glass, and stone. The installation is visually striking, with living elements weaving through shards of glass, creating an atmosphere of both fragility and resilience. However, the piece remains unfinished—its artist, **Vyros**, a quiet human, vanished mysteriously a few days before its completion. 

Vyros' sibling, **Maris**, has been left confused and upset by the sudden departure, and **Lana Serrikesh**, the exhibit curator, is worried that the piece will not be ready in time for the festival.

#### **Call to Action:**

As the crew of the **Tiger Moth** enters the **Terminal**, they are greeted by **Lana** and **Maris**, who are both visibly distressed. Lana is worried about the fate of **Shattered Silence** and its impact on the festival, while Maris is more concerned about their sibling's sudden disappearance. **Lana** asks if the crew can investigate what caused **Vyros** to leave and help either bring him back or finish the installation in his stead.

The crew must decide whether to help find **Vyros** or work alongside **Lana** and **Maris** to complete the art installation themselves, both options leading to significant emotional and artistic consequences.

#### **Choice:**

The essential choice in this encounter centers around how the crew wants to approach the problem:

1. **Investigate Vyros’ Disappearance**: The crew can delve into Vyros’ personal life and recent interactions with **Maris** and others in the Terminal, uncovering the emotional baggage that led to his sudden departure. This route allows them to focus on emotional support and reconciliation.
   
2. **Help Complete the Art Installation**: Alternatively, the crew can choose to stay behind and help **Lana** and **Maris** complete the installation before the festival. This option focuses on creativity and practical skills, as the crew will need to interpret Vyros' artistic vision and contribute their own.

#### **Tasks:**

##### **Investigating Vyros’ Disappearance**:
- **Recon (INT) 8+:** The crew can investigate the **Terminal**, talking to Maris, Lana, and other artists, piecing together Vyros’ final days before his departure. A successful check will reveal details about **Vyros’ strained relationship with Maris**, particularly surrounding a shared emotional trauma involving their deceased partner, a human clone—something deeply taboo in **human society**, especially among those like **Vyros** and **Maris**, who have ties to the anti-cloning sentiment of certain human colonies.

  **Exceptional Success:** Maris reveals the full extent of their sibling’s emotional struggle and guilt. The crew can track Vyros to a remote retreat on Sloni’s World and have the opportunity to reconcile with him and convince him to return.

  **Failure:** Maris remains closed off, leaving the crew without enough information to track Vyros down. The crew must then decide if they should continue searching or return to complete the exhibit.

  **Exceptional Failure:** The crew misreads the situation, further straining their relationship with **Maris**, making it nearly impossible to find Vyros in time.

##### **Interpersonal Check (SOC) 6+:**
Talking to **Maris** and **Lana** can open doors to deeper emotional insights. A **Diplomat** or **Persuade** check can help the crew unravel more details about **Vyros’ internal struggle**, particularly around his partner’s cloning and the guilt he carries over it.

- **Success:** The crew learns about the source of **Vyros' inner conflict**—his partner’s cloning was revealed, leading to his exile from the human colony they hailed from. **Maris**, in a moment of frustration, called him “more loyal to the dead,” a remark that cut deep because it echoed his old trauma.
  
- **Exceptional Success:** The crew gains more detailed insight into both **Maris’** and **Vyros’** emotional landscapes, giving them better leverage to find and persuade **Vyros** to return.

##### **Helping Complete the Art Installation**:

The crew may also choose to help **Lana** and **Maris** finish **Shattered Silence** in **Vyros’** absence. They’ll need to balance technical skills with a deep understanding of **Vyros’** artistic vision.

- **Art (DEX or INT) 8+:** Completing the piece requires careful coordination and understanding of the symbolism behind the living vines and shattered glass.

  **Exceptional Success:** The crew's work becomes a heartfelt tribute to **Vyros**, incorporating their own interpretation of resilience and renewal. The piece’s final form not only wows the gallery but also emotionally resonates with **Vyros**, potentially drawing him back to the festival.
  
  **Failure:** The installation lacks the intended emotional weight, and while it’s finished, it fails to live up to **Vyros’** vision, dampening the festival’s excitement.

##### **Persuading Vyros to Return:**
- **Persuade (SOC) 10+:** If the crew tracks **Vyros** to a nearby retreat, they’ll need to convince him to return. **Vyros**, dealing with guilt and confusion, will be difficult to sway unless the crew shows empathy for his struggle.

  **Exceptional Success:** **Vyros** comes back and finishes **Shattered Silence**, incorporating new elements inspired by his journey. His reunion with **Maris** is emotionally charged, offering hope for the future.
  
  **Failure:** **Vyros** remains distant, choosing to stay in self-imposed exile rather than face his sibling and community.
  
#### **Emotional Subtext:**

- **Lana Serrikesh (Aandrisk, she/her):** Lana is trying to hold things together, but she’s deeply concerned about the gallery’s reputation and the fate of the festival centerpiece. She has a natural empathy, but she struggles to balance her duties as a curator with her personal concern for **Vyros**. She needs reassurance from the crew that the festival won’t be a disaster, and that her efforts in running the gallery haven’t been in vain.

- **Maris (Human, she/her):** **Maris’** conflict with **Vyros** stems from their shared past. Their deceased partner, a clone, has long been a source of tension. **Maris** feels abandoned by **Vyros’** fixation on the past and their inability to move forward. Her comment about **Vyros** being "more loyal to the dead" was a moment of weakness, born out of her frustration. She now regrets it, but can’t bring herself to apologize.

- **Vyros (Human, they/them):** **Vyros** is emotionally distant, not because they lack feeling, but because they feel too much. Their self-imposed exile from their colony, triggered by their relationship with a cloned human, continues to haunt them. They throw themselves into their art as a means of expression, but when things get messy—like their argument with **Maris**—they shut down. They left because they were overwhelmed by both their past and the complexity of present relationships.

#### **Cultural History of Shattered Silence**:

The **Shattered Silence** exhibit draws from the cultural history of **Sloni’s World**, particularly the way the planet has healed from its colonial past. The vines represent the resurgence of natural life, growing over the shattered remains of the colonial system, symbolized by the glass. It is meant to evoke both the planet’s resilience and the fragility of its ecological balance.

Vyros’ artistic vision for **Shattered Silence** mirrors their own struggle with emotional fragility and resilience. Like the planet itself, **Vyros** is caught between the past and the present, trying to grow from the ruins of what once was.

#### **Scientific Details about the Orbal Bloom**:

In this encounter, the crew may overhear **Lana** discussing the **Orbal Bloom** while guiding visitors through the gallery. This rare plant, featured in the festival, requires a delicate balance of **microbial soil pods** and traditional hydroponic systems to thrive. The Bloom, known for reacting to the emotional resonance of those tending it, has become a symbol of hope and renewal, much like the theme of the gallery.

### **Impact on the Festival**:

- If the crew successfully resolves the situation with **Shattered Silence**, it becomes a central piece in the festival, representing the delicate balance between past and future, fragility and strength. **Vyros’** return will add emotional weight to the festival’s climax.
  
- If the crew fails, the festival loses some of its emotional power, as the incomplete **Shattered Silence** becomes a symbol of unresolved tensions, both for **Vyros** and for **Sloni’s World**.

In either case, the crew’s actions will shape the future of **Sloni’s World**, leaving a lasting impression on the gallery and the community.
