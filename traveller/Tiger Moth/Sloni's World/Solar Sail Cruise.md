	### **Set the Scene**

---

*As the solar-powered ship glides smoothly over the serene waters of Sloni’s inland sea, a gentle breeze whispers through the sails. The sky above stretches wide, a pale lavender hue tinged with streaks of warm coral, as the last rays of the day begin to fade into twilight. The rhythmic hum of the ship’s engines is barely noticeable, drowned out by the occasional splash of water against the hull. Soft light spills across the deck, creating an inviting glow that mingles with the reflections of the sea.*

*You find yourselves aboard a vessel unlike any you’ve seen before—its sleek design blending ancient techniques with cutting-edge technology. The towering sails, thin and transparent, shimmer with the stored energy of the sun, casting a golden aura over the ship. Beneath you, the waters of the inland sea are impossibly clear, glowing faintly with the bioluminescent coral far below. You can just make out the shapes of intricate reefs, twisting and branching beneath the surface like an underwater forest.*

*In the distance, jagged cliffs rise up from the sea, their dark stone softened by the evening light. Farther beyond, the vast sky seems to stretch endlessly toward the stars that have just begun to flicker to life. The calm of the moment settles over you, as the ship sails onward—carrying with it the quiet promise of discovery and peace.*

*On the deck, clusters of passengers have gathered. Some lean on the railings, gazing out at the horizon, while others share laughter and stories, their voices blending with the sounds of the ocean. Nearby, a table is set with delicate glass lanterns, their soft flames casting a warm glow across the wood. Further ahead, a small dance floor has been set up beneath the ship’s glowing sails, the air above it alive with the faint hum of stored solar energy, waiting to burst into light.*

*Above all, there is a sense of quiet magic, as if the sea and sky themselves are holding their breath—waiting for you to take part in the calm and beauty of this place. Whatever burdens you carried aboard seem to lighten in the glow of the sea and stars. For now, you are simply here, surrounded by peaceful waters, an open sky, and the subtle warmth of connection.*

  - **Quote Prompt: Why can’t I just make the choice?**

  - **Quote Prompt: What’s the secret to making peace with yourself?**
