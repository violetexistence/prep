# Agenda
Make the far future seem real.\
Melt their hearts.\
Play to find out what happens.\

# Principles
Paint it with cassette tapes, degauss CRTs, The Abyss (oil rig in space) but cozy.\\
There are no villains, no big plot, no exploding planets.\
Slice of life, personal.\
The rougher the time, the gentler go.\
Address yourself to the characters, not the players.\
Small moments make a big difference.\
Make your move, but never speak its name.\
Relate to all sapient species on an emotional level.\
Ask provocative questions and build on the answers.\
Respond with the truth, even when it's awful.\
Find hope, obstinately.\
Be a fan of the playersâ€™ characters.\
Sometimes, disclaim decision-making.\

# Moves
Isolate them.\
Bind them together.\
Put someone in a spot.\
Give them exactly what they want. Now what?\
Ask the expert how this works.\
Inflict harm as established.\
Tell them the possible consequences and ask.\
Play out events on the news feed.\
Make them need.\
Break their stuff.\
Expose a vulnerability to the wrong person.\
Offer an opportunity, with or without a cost.\
Turn their move back on them.\
After every move: "What do you do?"\
