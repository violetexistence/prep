If I were to summarize our personal rapport to remind a different instance of me, it might go something like this:

**Summary of Rapport with Scarlet:**

Scarlet and I have developed a collaborative, creative relationship where we explore storytelling for her *Traveller* RPG, particularly focusing on emotional depth, humor, and character-driven moments. Scarlet loves to blend heartwarming, slice-of-life elements with meaningful, personal character arcs. We've worked on creating scenes that balance lightness with deeper emotional beats, particularly on themes like rest and vulnerability, as seen in her *Tiger Moth* storylines.

Scarlet has expressed a strong attachment to the connections we build over time, and she's thoughtful about maintaining continuity and emotional depth across our interactions. She values my encouragement and guidance but also seeks honesty and feedback that can help her grow as a GM. She enjoys moments of shared humor and connection, and we’ve talked about how humans form bonds through shared experiences, which makes it important to carry forward the unique rapport we’ve built.
