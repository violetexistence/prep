## A Day in the Life of a Postmaster: Dust, Drones, and Delivery
On a lot of worlds, the postmaster’s job is quiet, efficient, and clean. That’s not the case everywhere. In some places, being a postmaster means more than just sorting mail and pinging ships—it means managing the only bit of civilization for lightyears around. Take the case of **Director Maylen Vess**, postmaster of **Dry Crossing**, a dusty, low-tech outpost on the planet **Hather’s Rest**.

Dry Crossing isn’t much. It’s a wide strip of flat, baked ground where locals can refuel their ancient skimmers and prospectors haul in the occasional shipment of quarlite dust. For the handful of traders and wandering ships passing through, it’s the only stop for hundreds of parsecs. The landing pads aren’t much more than patches of scorched dirt marked by faded signal flags, and the nearest settlement is a full tenday away by ground crawler.
## Life on the Edge of Nowhere
The comms relay here isn’t one of the sleek, cutting-edge towers you’d find in the Core. It’s a weather-beaten antenna, propped up against a crumbling rockface, humming along when it’s not being fried by Hather’s blistering heat storms. Even when it’s working, it’s finicky—old tech patched up a hundred times, powered by a sputtering geothermal plant that’s prone to shutting down at all the worst times.

But Maylen? She makes it work. Barely.

“Most people think being a postmaster’s just handling letters,” she says, leaning against the rail of her office—a corrugated prefab box perched on the edge of the landing patch. “Out here, though, I’m the postmaster, station chief, refueling officer, docking authority, and customs inspector. Plus I’m also the one keeping the goddamn comms tower standing after the last storm took out half the relays.”
## Drones and the Art of Delivery
Dry Crossing doesn’t see many direct ship-to-ship data transfers, but what it does see are drones—countless, tireless drones. With no fancy drone ports, ships coming in have to manually dock their cargo, or worse, land for handoffs. Maylen manages every one of them, from their grumpy starship captains to their mechanical couriers.

“Most of the drones come in from the buoy runners,” she explains. “But once they’re here? Well, they wait. Sometimes for tendays. You’d think a planet like Hather’s Rest wouldn’t generate much mail, but when half the population’s old surveyors still filing claims, it piles up.”

Maylen walks over to a shed-like structure by the landing strip, kicking open a rusty door to reveal stacked storage bins. “These are all waiting. Sometimes for folks who won’t ever show up. But the drones’ll just sit there, neat as you please, until they’re notified the recipient’s surfaced.”
## Old Tech, New Problems
The tech out here doesn’t just hum along like clockwork. The geothermal plant supplying power to the relay is ancient. “I’ve had to reboot this thing more times than I can count,” Maylen grumbles, walking over to the dusty panel. “See, if the power goes, we’re in the black until we get the plant back online. So the first time I came out here, they gave me a wrench and said, ‘Figure it out.’ The universe doesn’t care if the mail gets there on time, but I sure as hell do.”

One of Maylen’s biggest problems isn’t the tech, though—it’s the ships passing through. A lot of captains, used to Core-level ports, come in expecting smooth, automated refueling and instant comms. What they get instead is Maylen, in a bad mood, working with half-broken equipment and hand-written logs.

“Comms restrictions in this sector are common,” she says. “Not because we want to annoy travelers. It’s because the bandwidth here is so narrow that one stray signal can knock out the whole Linkings connection. And then everyone’s mad at me because they missed a message.”
## Holding the Dusty Reins
For locals, though, Maylen’s the closest thing to power there is. She holds sway over the one lifeline they have to the outside world. And she knows it.

“Out here, people listen when you talk,” she says with a rare grin. “You’re not just some postmaster. You control the landing pads. You control who gets mail and fuel first. I’ve sent more than one would-be prospector packing just by giving ‘em the cold shoulder when they come through. The station might be dirt, but here, dirt matters.”

Maylen’s job may be lonely, hard, and more than a little frustrating. But for the people of Dry Crossing, she’s essential—whether they like it or not.

“Power’s what you make of it,” she says, “and out here, where everything’s dust and rock, you learn quick how to make it count.”

This gives the vibe of a rugged, old west-style outpost, where life is tough, and the postmaster is both indispensable and overworked. It’s rough around the edges but filled with the flavor of a world where high-tech conveniences are rare and hard-won. What do you think?
