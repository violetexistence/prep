# The Reward
It feels like most roleplaying games use combat as a main pillar of play. Why?

/insert rant about cultural focus on violence

Idea: Maybe the reason is because it's "easier" to gamify combat. 
Logic: Roleplaying games are games. Games are better with winners and losers. Strong rewards are also fun and what's a stronger reward than survival?

Also: even very combat centered games, like D&D and other incarnations of d20 fantasy, are used for other settings, other types of games, despite it being an unsupportive life support system for those games. Social media is full of posts that ask for help adapting 5E to run every conceivable type of game. Sometimes it can work. I think if you can imagine a way to reskin fighting monsters, 5E is a fit. Otherwise, not so much. If fighting is NOT the main thing that compels the story in your game, it's not a good fit. Nevertheless, it is done. A lot.
