This is a story about people. It is not a story about epic events. In it we will follow the crew of the [ship] doing the work of bringing cargo and passengers to the worlds where they need to be. It is set in a universe that could be our own in the far future. The setting is speculative, grounded in science. It has a chewy, rebelliously optimistic center. It is not grimdark.

In session zero we will create/generate traveller characters together. There will be time to fully consider and flesh out character details on your own. While we navigate this process, keep in mind the following must be true at the end:
* You crew for the free trader, [ship].
* You start on the [world] - [world] run. It's a safe and prosperous route, with plenty of commerce, and plenty of competition. Exciting opportunities exist on other routes for starships with upgraded jump drives.

In this universe there are many sapient species. Humans (we) are the newcomers to the community. Well built things work for different kinds of hands.

There is faster than light travel. Information does not travel any faster than the fastest ship.

There is no space feudalism. We have a form of evolving bureaucratic capitalism. Once, it was bad for everyone except the few. Megacorporations ruled through a Trade Federation and private armies. We had a terrible war. It fell apart. From the ashes we decided to built it back different. We didn't keep everyone.
