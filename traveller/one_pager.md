This is a story about people. It is not a story about epic events. In it we will follow the crew of the [ship] doing the work of bringing cargo and passengers to the worlds where they need to be. It is set in a universe that could be our own in the far future. The setting is speculative, grounded in science. It has a chewy, rebelliously optimistic center. It is not grimdark.

In session zero we will create/generate traveller characters together. There will be time to fully consider and flesh out character details on your own. While we navigate this process, keep in mind the following must be true at the end:
* You crew for the free trader, [ship].
* You start on the [world] - [world] run. It's a safe and prosperous route, with plenty of commerce, and plenty of competition. Exciting opportunities exist on other routes for starships with upgraded jump drives.

In this universe there are many sapient species. 

There is faster than light travel.
