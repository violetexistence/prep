# Agenda
Make the future seem possible.
Melt their hearts.
Play to find out what happens.
# Principles
Paint everything like it's somewhere between 1977 and 1997.
Address yourself to the characters, not the players.
Lower the stakes but make it personal.
Make your move, but never speak its name.
Name everyone, make everyone a person.
Ask provocative questions and build on the answers.
Respond with obstinate optimism.
Be a fan of the playersâ€™ characters.
Sometimes, disclaim decision-making.
# Moves
Give them exactly what they want. Now what?
Ask the expert how this works.
