# Akeed
"Lovably yucky". Lower bodies are a single soft, slug-like, round appendage that allows slow movement over solid ground. Eyestalks and mouth like opening at the top encased in cartilaginous covering. Two pairs of tentacles ending in boneless dactyli. 75cm in height but can extend of to 1.25m. Locomotion over surfaces is slow but in water they can propel themselves quickly by drawing in water and expelling it suddenly. They can stick to smooth surfaces.

No sense of taste or smell. They exude a smell that humans find pleasing.

No mouth but they can sing and even communicate verbally using their breathing hole.

In their communities debate and humor are valued. They are known among other sapient species as excellent diplomats. 

As charming and cheerful as an Akeed in a mineral bath.

I felt like I was being cross examined by an Akeed prosecutor.

# Droyne
Wings, scales, colorful feathers. Egg layers. Exothermic.
Oynprith, a language specific to Droyne, uses gestures as much as spoken words.
Those encountered outside Oytrip (droyne communities) tend to be younger. 

# Faar
Humanoid but not related to humaniti. Pale skin with fine scale which can change color. No body hair. Mouth but no vocal chords. Communicate natively using chromatophores in their cheeks. Those who work and travel outside Alpharric (the Faar homeworld) get implants which allow them to communicate verbally with other species. They implant detects speech and translates it into signals that are sent to the same receptors used to read colors. They also emit speech sounds based on the signals consciously sent to the implant, allowing the wearer to optionally communicate verbally, using color, or both. It is difficult, although not impossible, for Faar to lie. Engaging in purely verbal communication makes it easier, but other Faar consider it suspicious when in the company of other members of their species.

TL15. Super advanced stuff. Maybe they were the victors in a war in the distant past where they played a little galactic police and put an end to some fashy stuff the Akeed were doing.

They have three sexes. Egg producers (female), egg fetilizers (male), and asexual (agender). Females produce only one or two eggs in their lifespan. They are encouraged to take their fertile period away from their work and be pampered. Some males train (get degrees) in caregiving and child rearing. Spa facilities host females during their term. A holiday, called Shimmerquick, celebrates this process.

Interspecies coupling is forbidden, by law in some communities. Even where such laws do not exist, any Faar (especially a female Faar) will be marked socially by such a relationship. Conservatives will cite low birth rate and duty to species as justification for this behavior. Progressive thinkers prioritize autonomy and individuality over tradition, claiming that evolution is a crude instrument, a brute force that need not be adhered to so slavishly. Despite this hope of enlightened perpetuation, there has been a sharp decline in birth rates. More than anything, this is credited for the overall more insular nature of the Alpharric government and its people seeking less contact with its neighbors.

The overall disposition of the Faar people and of the administration on Alphaaric toward their neighbors is a supportive one. 

# Harmagian
Harmagians are a powerful and wealthy sapient species and founding members of the GC. Prior to the Galactic Commons' creation, the Harmagians possessed a vast colonial empire. Their native language is Hanto.
## Appearance & Biology
They have a gastropod bodyplan with speckled colorations common from bright yellow to black. Their bodies are contained within a soft, wet cuticle. They are smaller than humans with three to four foot lengths average. They use unipedal undulation as their innate form of locomotion, which is most efficient in water, and motorized carts or other mobility aids being expected for most environments. Visual sensory perception is provided by eyestalks. A wreath of tentacles, each ending in dactyli around a toothless mouth.

Sexual dimorphism in this species produces both males and females, which are primarily distinguished using spot patterns across their backs.

They are known to have extremely sensitive skin and finicky stomachs, necessitating a restricted diet and avoidance of hot food. They do not possess a sense of smell as humans would understand and do not breathe. They respire using passive diffusion through their skin and are able to sense chemicals in the air by the same manner, a sense they call *kur'hon* "air touch". They speak using a dedicated airbag/sack-like organ at the back of their throats called a *kurrakibat*.
## Offspring
Harmagians leave their offspring in the care of specialized facilities, where the polyps spend the time they need to develop attached to a rock, fed by a nutrient brine that cradles them with gentle artificial waves. Little buds develop into tentacles and the brain grows until the polyp is ready and detaches from the rock wall. This is seen as its death, as its behavior changes radically, from passive and stationary polyp to an infant Harmagian, that begin to explore their brine filled tanks. At first their movement is uncoordinated, but over time they become proficient in the use of their own tentacles and new bodies. Somewhere around this time their first memories are formed.

Harmagian children are raised in schools and do not live with their biological parents.
## Culture and History
Before the Galactic Commons were formed, Harmagians had a vast empire, enslaving many less technologically advanced species including the Akaraks. After becoming involved in a long, bloody war with the Aeluons, the Harmagians and Aeluon negotiated peace mediated by the Aandrisks, which created the GC. When the Sapient Sovereignty Act went into effect as part of the Hashkath Accords, all the homeworlds colonized by Harmagians were returned to their native inhabitants. It is theorized by an Aeluon scholar that the Harmagians' physical limitations have actually been a benefit to them, forcing them to create more advanced technology and allowing other species to underestimate them, making them easier to conquer.

Harmagians are known to be very rich, working on their ships being one of the best paying jobs for spacers. They also are known to be big sponsors of the arts. The style of Harmagian contemporary decor (at least in s321) is bright, bold, and full of smooth geometry.

Manners are very important to Harmagians, especially the relationship between hosts and guests. Guests who do not behave properly are as bad as "petty thieves". The rules for Harmagian conduct are written in a large, tedious volume that most Harmagians are expected to follow.

# Aandrisk
Aandrisks are one of the three founding species of the Galactic Commons. Their homeworld is Hashkath. Their native language is Reskitkish.
## Appearance & Biology
Aandrisks are reptilian, covered in green or blue scales, and have very flat features. They are androgynous, taller than humans, with large muscular thighs and clawed hands and feet. Their heads are covered with multi-colored feathers, which grow in upon maturity. They may give a feather to people who have touched their life significantly.
## Culture & History
Aandrisks are very physical, and have a casual attitude towards sex. Children are not considered fully "people" until their feathers grow in, and their deaths are not typically mourned. This is mostly due to the high rate of unhatched eggs and high hatchling mortality rate: a biological and cultural necessity for a race that bonds through casual sex.

Aandrisk family structures change over the course of their life: as children, they are raised in a "hatch family", then move out into the world as adults to find a "feather family", or a group of people they choose to live with. This may change over time. Finally, as elders, Aandrisks typically form or join a "house family" which raises children, becoming their "hatch family" in turn. Aandrisk children are not usually raised by their genetic, or "egg" parents, but rather are given away to a suitable house family as eggs.
# Aeluon
Aeluon are one of three founding species in the Galactic Commons. They are notable for their advanced technology, particularly weapons. Their homeworld is Sohep Frie.
## Appearance & Biology
Aeluons are a four limbed, bipedal species similar to humans, but with silver skin composed of fine scales which never molt. They are bald, and have large eyes with second eyelids and small mouths. They have iridescent patches on their cheeks which are used for communication via color. When an Aeluon becomes fertile with eggs, their scales shimmer faintly.
## Genders & Fertility
Aeluons have four distinct genders. One that produces eggs, one that can fertilize them, one that involuntarily switches between the two (called "shon"), and one that is infertile. Pre-space travel Aeluon culture segregated Aeluon villages by gender, Shimmerquick being one of the very few occasions different genders interacted.

Egg-producing Aeluons only become fertile two or three times in their lives, at most. Some of them never do. They are expected to take time off once they begin to shimmer and head to a facility to mate and have their egg. This can be a stressful time for Aeluons, so it is made as comfortable as possible and treated like a vacation. Aeluon gestation takes about a month. The Aeluon mother does not take care of their offspring but many stay in close contact with them, especially ground-dwelling Aeluons. Spacer Aeluons have a harder time keeping in touch with their children. Aeluon children are raised in creches by groups of fathers who are specifically educated for this purpose.
## Culture & History
Aeluons are known to be somewhat superstitious, putting significance into certain numbers and symbols. Interspecies relationships are taboo in Aeluon society, as they are seen as a threat to the species' future.
## Color-based Communication
Aeluons are deaf and mute, so do not traditionally speak. Instead, they communicate with each other through patches of skin located on their cheeks that are capable of flashing different colors rapidly. After making contact with other creatures and joining the Galactic Commons, Aeluon travellers have taken to implanting voice emulators into their throats to be able to communicate verbally with other species and implants that catch sound and transform it to signals that Aeluon brains can understand. As spacial hearing is a concept that just can't be processed by Aeluons, the implants produce a tingling sensation in the skin of their head in the direction the sound is coming from. Adult Aeluons' sound-processing implants are often highly decorative.

# Akarak
**Akaraks** are a species found in the same territory as the Galactic Commons. Their language Ihreet, which is largely based on Hanto. Early in their history, the Akaraks were colonized and used as slave laborers by the Harmagians. Their homeworld, Akari, was left uninhabitable.
## Appearance & Biology
Akaraks are significantly smaller than most other sapients in the GC. They have beaks. Large keratin hooks, used for climbing and swinging, grow from their wrists. When not in their ships or shuttles, Akaraks move around in powered exoskeletal suits. This is partially due to how Akaraks propel themselves, but mainly because the quantities of oxygen that most other sapients need are toxic to them; they mostly breathe methane.

Akarak children hatch from eggs and require very specific nutrients, which can cause difficulties in finding food.
## Culture & History
Akaraks reach adulthood at around one standard, and live for an average of about twenty standards. Because of this relatively short lifespan, they are trained from childhood in a limited amount of subjects they have an aptitude for (this is one of the reasons many of them do not speak Klip). Their names tend to reflect these specialist skillsets.

Akaraks live on ships, in groups that are non-hierarchical as well as completely insular and autonomous; there is no overarching Akarak authority. Most go to considerable lengths to hide themselves from other sapients, including obscuring their ships' signals and flying seemingly nonsensical routes. Though Akaraks are known to be quite poor - some turning to lives of piracy and crime in order to survive - the concepts of fairness and balance are very important to them.

Once every standard, Akaraks gather at a previously agreed upon point in space for a *rakree*, or 'sharing'.
## GC Membership
After the Sapient Sovereignty Act - the return of all Harmagian-colonized worlds to their native species - the Akaraks requested the GC's help in finding a new homeworld, as Akari was no longer suited for habitation. An agreement could not be reached, partly due to the highly bureaucratic nature of the GC as well as Akaraks' specific environmental needs and limited lifespan. In standard 261, the Akarak Gathering formally withdrew their pending application for GC membership and closed all negotiation channels.
## Names
Speaker, Tracker, Fixer, Flyer, Doc
# Sianat
The **Sianat** are a reclusive Galactic Commons species from the Sianat homeworld. Their native languages are Ciretou and Duslen.
## Appearance & Biology
Sianats are lanky, bow-backed, and four-limbed, with two broad feet and two long-fingered hands. Their coal-grey skin is covered ("from scalp to toenails") in dense ice-blue fur. They also have big, long-lashed eyes and sharp, carnivorous teeth. When they are young, they cling to the fur of their mother's back.

The Sianat homeworld is cold and snowy. Sianats live in heated, underground burrows, and are nocturnal. They prefer to sleep on beds without covers, as to not stifle the flow of air over fur.
## Culture & History
### Pairs
On the Sianat homeworld, all children are infected with a neurovirus called the Whisperer during a ritual called the Pairing. This changes their brain functions and physiology, allowing them to intuitively understand the multidimensional nature of space. Once infected, the host and virus are collectively referred to as a Sianat Pair. Sianat Pairs think of themselves as a plural entity, and use plural pronouns.

Pairs are encouraged to go out into the universe and share the gifts of the Whisperer with other species. They file down their naturally sharp teeth to indicate their avowed service to others and lack of a desire to conquer. They shave their fur into intricate fractal patterns to represent cosmological truths.

Sianat Pairs do not consume regular food. Instead, they eat a carefully balanced nutrient paste called _hemle_.
### Solitary
Solitary Sianats, referred to as "Heretics" by Pairs, are Sianats who are cured of the Whisperer. They retain their Astrogation skills and understanding of spacetime, as the brain-folds caused by the virus are permanent, but are removed of all other side effects.

Most Solitary live on a rogue planet called Arun. They may be heretics, but are not revolutionaries; they are good inventors, using their advanced understanding of space and mathematics for creation rather than Astrogating, e.g. building a pint-sized space elevator.

# The Exodus Fleet
The Exodus Fleet, sometimes called the Exodan Fleet, is a collection of ships housing a significant portion of Humanity. It is one of the choices available for your traveller's homeworld.

## History

The original Exodans left Earth out of necessity, when the planet became uninhabitable. The ships were constructed over several generations from melted down skyscrapers and other structures. Exodans wandered the galaxy for hundreds of years before making contact with the GC. The ships now orbit a star named Risheth, gifted to them by the Aandrisks. In s. 313, a Harmagian researcher published _Record of a Spaceborn Few_, a non fictional account of zer time spent in the Exodus Fleet, mostly aboard the Asteria. The book has become a bestseller and is sure to become foundational for understanding the human species.

## The Fleet

### Homesteaders

The Exodus Fleet is composed of 32 homesteader ships and many smaller ferries, shuttles and satellites, including the partially dismantled wreck of the Oxomoco. Every homesteader consists of a main cylinder, which holds life support facilities, and a habitat ring. Originally, gravity was generated by centrifugal force. Aeluons provided the Fleet with artigrav nets when contact was made, though the main cylinders are still zero-g.

### Known ships in the Fleet

Asteria - the main setting of _Record of a Spaceborn Few_. Oxomoco - a homesteader that suffered catastrophic damage, causing the deaths of thousands of people. Ratri - home to Eyas, an Exodan Caretaker. Caretakers prepare the bodies of dead Exodans for composting and counsels the families of those who died. Newet - suffered an outbreak of the Marabunta virus in s. 309. Dou Mu - hosted the thirty-first annual Bug Fry Festival. Al-Qaum - home briefly to Sawyer, a salvage tech mentioned in _Record of a Spaceborn Few_, who was killed on a job working in the wreck of the Oxomoco. All of the names are based on deities of the night, stars, astrology or cosmos.

### Structure

Each habitat ring consists of six hexagons, and is divided hexagonally on the inside as well: six hexagonal rooms around a seventh form a home. Six homes surrounding a common area form a hex, which is a Fleet member's main address. Hex mates often cook together and help each other with tasks like raising children. Six hexes surrounding a hub form a neighborhood, with the hub containing everyday services such as medical clinics, cafes and playgrounds. Six neighborhoods surrounding a plaza form a district. The plaza is where schools, marketplaces and recycling centers are situated. In the middle of every district is The Centre, where the dead are processed. Thirty-six districts (six triangles composed of six districts) form a deck, with farms and manufacturing in the nucleus. Four decks form a segment, of which each homesteader has six. Besides the residential decks, there are decks for transport, which contain pods to travel between districts, waste processing, and observation.

## Culture

"From the ground, we stand. From our ships, we live. By the stars, we hope." Exodans are known throughout the Galactic Commons as pacifists. They are a tightly-knit, egalitarian society that values their traditions. The original Fleet architects based everything around the principles of longevity, stability and well-being, ideas that have remained prevalent. Nothing in the Fleet gets wasted, instead going through elaborate recycling systems. Labor is not compensated: everyone receives the resources they need to live, and barter is the most common system of commerce. Credits are used for trade with other GC species. Human spacers often keep an eye on the Thread, Exodan Fleet feeds on the Linkings, for information on the state of the entire diaspora, as they often contain news from all over the Human territories. The Fleet Admiral at this time is named Ranya May.
## Position in the Galactic Commons

Relations between Solomani and the Fleet have been frigid but are improved. Four years after the Oxomoco disaster, Martian president Kevin Liu was informed via GC diplomats of their contact with the Exodus Fleet. Liu has since unveiled a memorial out of solidarity for their wayward kin. Even before their official membership in s. 260, the Exodus Fleet was a protectorate of The Galactic Commons and its people granted provisional rights. 

Exodans are generally viewed as anachronistic, choosing to live on board their homesteaders when they could settle down on the ground. Their frugality is often misconstrued as poverty, leading some of the wealthier or more technologically advanced communities to treat Exodans like charity cases.
# Quelin
The **Quelin** are a species that is part of the [Galactic Commons]. They are said to be there so [Harmagians] can gain access to their vast natural resources.
## Appearance and Biology
Humans describe the Quelin as "lobster centaurs". They are a blue arthropodic species with many legs, mask-like faces, and black compound eyes. They have chitinous blue exoskeletons, decorative frills around their upper torsos, and thick, black-blue domes on the top of their head they can use as rams. They often decorate their shells with symbols and polished stones. Although they are a part of the Galactic Commons, it is rare for a Quelin to travel outside of their own space, as they are a particularly xenophobic species.

Male Quelin carry their partner's eggs in keratin pouches in their shell until they hatch.
## Culture and history
The Quelin home planet is [Vemereng], their native language [Tellerain](https://wayfarers.fandom.com/wiki/Tellerain "Tellerain").

Quelin are often a harsh and bureaucratic species ruled by the Quelin Protectorate. They have strict laws against inter-species relationships and cloning. Cloning is seen as especially evil because of a series of Quelin wars involving eugenics where cloned soldiers were one of the weapons of choice.

Teracite ore, prized because of its use to create circuit panels for artigrav and M-Drives, is mined in penal colonies by Quelin prisoners.
# Solomani
Humans whose ancestors are from one of the worlds in the Sol system are called Solomani. 

In s. 226, after meeting the humans of the Exodus Fleet, scouts from the GC, using coordinates gleaned from telemetry shared from Exodan ships, jumped into the Sol system. Diplomatic and trade relations were swiftly offered and eagerly accepted by the Solomani. Each standard, thousands of Solomani immigrate into the GC, making their presence in GC member worlds more and more common. There has been no mention yet of member status, but many believe this is inevitable.
## Mars
**Mars** has only been partially terraformed, but is home to a large and cosmopolitan colony. All Martian cities are domed. Trade relations with the GC has brought new terraforming technology as well as the jump drive. Integrating this technology into the ongoing Martian project, however, must now compete with the desire by many of its workers to emigrate to the GC. The primary city of Mars is Florence, named after the first explorer to set foot on Mars.

Mars was first settled by Humans leaving Earth. Historically, one of the main causes of tension between Exodan and Solomani Humans is that the wealthy Martian settlers shipped livestock through space while people back on Earth went hungry.

The Martian president is Kevin Liu.
## Earth
The population of Earth is much lower than it once was. After the departure of the Exodus Fleet, the remaining inhabitants emigrated to Mars if could afford it. Those that could not, had no choice but to rebuild their communities with the resources that were left. Their descendants emerged with a new identity and new purpose. Their strength born from grief and stubborn refusal to go quietly into oblivion and it is from their struggle, their journey, that we first learn the name Solomani.

In the light of this heavenly angel
we see ourselves true
for the first time.

She is if you will
a master of schemes
but righteous schemes
she'll often lie
but only for the sake of truth

she plays the game
she humors enemies in bout
to shield the earth from lustful hands
that would destroy 
that which she only knows to love

she by truest nature
is truly just
and loving by every way of the joyful heart
in a world spared of wolves
in tempest

might she escape to finer regions
and enjoy the healing embrace
of silence
where love runs the fields unbound
and all that stirs in chaos
are flowers dancing in the wind

alas this life is not befit
the world of terror
where she treats the lust
of fallen men
to ring the fruits of angels
and bind their flowers and chains

it is to this reality
she gives herself a sacrifice
of peace
that others might prosper
and imagine days to come

she is not made for hush
and liesure
nay she is born for destiny
a destiny for the ages to remember

an echo of her deeds
and for that will she toil
in the test of gods

though still by trial of madness
through rivers of tears
and mountains far behind
where golden kingdoms bowed to tyrants
did she never let her soul ascent
to darkness

and if the soul
though what devils may come
should live on in truth to nature
then so too shall dreams persist
forever waiting in eternity 
to rise again from the valley of love 
and yellow jasmines

Centuries have passed. Reconstructionists have risen to power. Relations between Earthen and Martian communities has evolved. It is more cooperative and supportive of human throughout the Sol system. Advanced technology and resources from GC traders are also becoming available. Because the cultural values present within their community, fewer humans see emigration as desirable. This means Earth may in the end benefit more than Mars from GC trade relations.

The Director of the Earth Reclamation project is Shohreh "Kiki" Pandit-Mao. The project is administered from Earth's largest settlement, Shambala.
## Exodan Relations
Solomani and Exodans are attempting to overcome their differences. This is demonstrated, for example, by the All Stories Festival and the reveal of a statue on Mars in commemoration of the Oxomoco disaster that happened in the Fleet. 

This festival, which occurred just this standard on s. 321/013,  marked the semi-millennial Remembrance Day, a holiday commemorating the day the Exodans left Earth. The Festival was celebrated in Florence, on Mars and Shambala, on Earth. Although Remembrance Day originated as an Exodan custom, the All Stories Festival was organized by Exodan and Solan Humans together in a demonstration of Human unity.
# Laru
The **Laru** are a species within the [Galactic Commons]

The Laru home system is [Uoa]. The official Laru language is Mululo, though some speak regional languages, such as Piloom. Piloom is the language spoken in the Laru agricultural colony known as [Ulapot].
## Appearance & Biology
Laru are mammals with thick, reddish fur and long necks. They can walk on either two or four legs and are reported to be about the height of a tall human when walking on four. They have eight-valved hearts. They are similar to marsupials, in that they are born very small and undeveloped. They grow in their parent’s belly pouch until they are able to move and function outside. Laru have a comparatively long lifespan and thus a very long childhood, with Laru children reaching maturity around 30 standards.
### Olotohen
Triggered by environmental dangers such as extreme heat, cold, or oxygen deficiency, young Laru can enter a metabolic state known as _olotohen_. Internal functions shut down almost entirely in this state, and brain function is minimal. This state sometimes resolves on its own, but can most reliably be reversed by a trained medical professional.
## Culture and history
They did not develop spaceflight themselves but were contacted by Aandrisk ambassadors. They reacted with joy and interest to the knowledge of other sapients in the galaxy and are said to be great with multispecies sensitivity.

Laru tend to live in large, communal buildings that serve all Laru in a specific area.

Laru breed a non-toxic variety of [redreed]. They are noted to have no funerary customs. Laru don't couple with [Aandrisk] because they are allergic to them.
### Gender
Young Laru are of undefined gender and use pronouns ze/zir. They declare a gender (which could also be no gender/inbetween genders) when reaching maturity. This is usually celebrated with a party.
## Names
Ouloo, Tupo, Oouoh, Tuumuu
