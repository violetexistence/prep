# Agenda
Make the far future seem real. \
Melt their hearts. \
Play to find out what happens.
# Principles
Paint everything like it's somewhere between 1977 and 1997.\
Address yourself to the characters, not the players.\
Lower the stakes but make it personal.\
Make your move, but never speak its name.\
Make all species just a little bit human.\
Ask provocative questions and build on the answers.\
Respond with pain, trauma, and something better on the other side.\
Be a fan of the playersâ€™ characters.\
Sometimes, disclaim decision-making.
# Moves
Isolate them.\
Bind them together.\
Put someone in a spot.\

After every move: "What do you do?"\
