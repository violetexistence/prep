**SUBJECT:** Ship Modifications - Artist Retreat  

> Hey there, Captain Malone,  
>  
> I got your details from the folks over at the Terminal. Sounds like you're hosting quite the crowd for your artist retreat. They mentioned you’ll need some special modifications for one of your guests—methane-breather, right?  
>  
> No worries, I’ve handled this sort of thing before. I’ll need to check out your ship to get the specs and see how best to fit a charging dock for the exosuit, along with a safe space for your guest to rest outside the suit. Might have to shuffle some things around, but nothing I can’t handle.  
>  
> If you’ve got a preferred time, let me know, and I’ll swing by the starport. Shouldn’t take more than an hour to get a solid plan in place. I’ll bring my own tools, so no need to worry about that.  
>  
> Looking forward to seeing what you’re putting together out there.  
>  
> P.S. If there’s anything else you need sorted while I’m around, don’t hesitate to ask. I’m a sucker for a good challenge.
