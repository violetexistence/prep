### **Set the Scene**
Nestled deep within the remote mountains of **Sloni’s World** lies the entrance to the **Shadow Tunnels**, a series of winding caves illuminated by faint, natural bioluminescence. The glow comes from **Sloni moss**, a native plant feeding off minerals in the cave walls. The tunnels, long used by locals for meditation, have recently drawn the attention of archaeologists, who believe they may be connected to the planet’s ancient **Sloni myth**.

As the crew approaches, they meet **Kethras (Aandrisk, they/them)**, an archaeologist, and their assistant, **Avali (Human, she/her)**, who are focused on investigating relics found deeper within the caves. However, a **rockslide** has blocked access to the deeper sections, and a strange **pulse**—a mysterious, low-frequency wave—has been affecting their equipment and causing the moss to flicker erratically.

### **The Pulse: Mysterious Force at Work**
The **pulse** is a low-frequency electromagnetic wave that reverberates unpredictably through the caves. It causes equipment malfunctions and disrupts the glow of the **Sloni moss**, making the tunnels darker and more difficult to navigate. The pulse is irregular but growing stronger, and the bioluminescence flickers in response, suggesting a deeper connection between the planet and the ancient technology hidden in the caves.

- **Origin of the Pulse:** The pulse is caused by an ancient **power source** buried deep in the tunnels. It was once used by a long-forgotten civilization to harness the planet’s tectonic energy. Over time, the power source has decayed, leading to intermittent surges of energy that now cause the pulse.
- **Significance:** If the pulse is left unchecked or disturbed, it could destabilize the power source, leading to cave collapses, damaged ecosystems, or a massive energy discharge that could threaten lives.

### **NPCs Involved**

#### **Kethras (Aandrisk, they/them)**
- **Background:** Kethras is an experienced archaeologist with a passion for uncovering the mysteries of the **Shadow Tunnels**. They are driven by the excitement of discovery and a deep respect for the planet’s cultural history.
- **Personal Details:** Kethras is highly analytical and loves puzzles, but can sometimes become so engrossed in their work that they lose sight of the bigger picture. They are cautious and value thoroughness, often at odds with their assistant’s more adventurous approach. Kethras believes the pulse is a vital clue to uncovering an ancient civilization’s technology, and they are determined to study it before any interference.
- **Motivation:** Kethras wants to ensure the proper preservation of the archaeological site and unravel the mystery of the pulse. They will be wary of anyone suggesting a rash approach to solving the cave blockage.

**To Visitors:**
	*"This world is not just a place for rest; it is a place of deep connection, both to the past and to the living pulse of the planet. Every moss-covered stone, every glowing tendril of Sloni’s moss, carries a story older than our own species. To walk through these tunnels is to step back into the time before our ancestors even dreamed of stars."*

**Discussing the Pulse:**
	*"The pulse is not a glitch—it’s a language we don’t yet understand. To clear that rockslide without listening to the planet’s voice first… well, that would be like removing a stone from a house’s foundation without checking if the walls can hold. We must tread carefully, or the caves will take more than they give."*

**More on the Pulse:**
	*“Ground-penetrating radar? Yes, I’ve heard of such methods. But this—this is Sloni’s World. The caves, the stones, the very soil… they have a rhythm all their own. Bringing in such technology risks disrupting that balance. We’ve learned over the cycles that rushing to understand everything with machines often leaves us missing what the land is already telling us. The pulse, in its own way, is a message, and we’re trying to listen—quietly, patiently.”*

**Sharing Insight:**
	*"Our ancestors did not thrive by fighting against nature. They thrived by learning from it. We mustn’t rush to fix what we don’t fully understand. The caves have been here longer than any of us. Patience is not just a virtue; it’s survival."*
	
**To Volunteers:** 
	*"Sloni’s World is not a place you conquer. It’s a place you listen to, a place that teaches you to slow down, to observe. As you work with us, you’ll learn to trust the land. You’ll feel it in your bones when it’s time to act and when it’s time to step back and let the world work in its own way. No textbook can teach you that."*

#### **Avali (Human, she/her)**
- **Background:** Avali is Kethras’ assistant, a spirited and curious researcher who leans more toward taking risks. She is fascinated by the connection between the **Sloni myth** and the caves and is eager to uncover hidden secrets.
- **Personal Details:** Avali has a sharp wit and tends to clash with Kethras over their cautious approach. She often teases them, but her enthusiasm can lead her to rush into things. Avali sees the pulse as something exciting, an indication that they are on the brink of a significant discovery.
- **Motivation:** Avali is eager to prove herself in the field, believing that the pulse and the cave system hold valuable secrets. She wants to push forward, even if it means taking some risks with the rockslide.

**In the Heat of the Moment:**
	*"We can’t just sit here! The festival’s in a few days, and that rockslide’s blocking the most important part of the caves. If we don’t act now, we’ll miss our chance to uncover something truly significant—and I, for one, am not leaving without answers!"*

**A Little More Blunt, but with a Wry Smile:**
	*“It’s not that we haven’t thought about it—believe me. But have you ever tried lugging cutting-edge equipment to a low-tech world like this? The caves don’t exactly come equipped with loading docks for that kind of gear. And besides, this place, these tunnels, they’ve been here far longer than we’ve had any radar. There’s something to be said for letting the pulse reveal itself on its own terms. That doesn’t mean we don’t want answers, just that maybe the right tool for the job isn’t always the one that beeps the loudest.”*

**Encouraging Action:**
	*"You can feel it, can’t you? That pull? Something big is down here, something waiting to be found. We just need to move that rockslide, and the pulse will reveal its secrets. The planet won’t wait for us to meditate on it, Kethras. It’s time we stopped waiting, too."*

**After a Discovery:**
	*"See? I knew it! This was worth it. We’re standing on the edge of something monumental here. Who knows what else these caves are hiding? We just needed to be bold enough to find out."*

**To New Recruits:** 
	*"You want to make a name for yourself in archaeology? Then don’t wait around for perfect conditions. Be the one to take action. Out here, we’re on the frontlines of discovery. The planet’s not going to hand us anything on a silver platter—you’ve got to get your hands dirty. But trust me, the reward is worth the risk."*

### **The Problem: The Rockslide and the Pulse**
The rockslide blocking the way to the deeper parts of the tunnel is the immediate issue, but the pulse adds complexity. As **Kethras** and **Avali** argue about the best approach to clear the blockage, they involve the crew in the debate.

- **Kethras** argues that they should investigate the pulse before tampering with the rockslide, fearing that disrupting the natural energy flow of the caves could be dangerous.
- **Avali**, however, is convinced they need to clear the rockslide now and reach the deeper parts of the cave, pulse or no pulse, as the caves might hold the key to the festival centerpiece, which would secure her reputation.

The crew must decide whether to intervene with the pulse or push forward.

---

### **Choices**

- **Investigate the Pulse:**
   - If the crew chooses to investigate the pulse, they can use **Electronics** or **Science** skills to analyze it. If they succeed, they’ll discover that it is caused by an ancient power source and can adjust their approach accordingly.
   - **Success:** The crew will stabilize the pulse, allowing safe passage through the caves and possibly uncovering an ancient **Sloni artifact**, which will become the symbolic centerpiece of the upcoming festival.
   - **Failure:** Equipment malfunctions, the pulse intensifies, and the crew must navigate the caves in near darkness. Proceeding without solving the pulse might lead to a **cave collapse** or further energy disturbances.

- **Clear the Rockslide:**
   - If the crew chooses to clear the rockslide without investigating the pulse, they will have to use **Athletics** or **Mechanic** skills. This is a riskier option as it may amplify the pulse and cause cave instability.
   - **Success:** The rockslide is cleared, but the pulse grows stronger, and the crew must deal with malfunctioning equipment and the growing instability of the tunnels.
   - **Failure:** A cave collapse occurs, trapping or injuring some of the crew or NPCs. The pulse causes even greater disruptions to the ecosystem, making future expeditions dangerous.

---

### **Emotional Subtext and Character Impact**

**Kethras** is driven by curiosity but deeply cautious. A successful investigation of the pulse will earn their respect, and they may share valuable insight or offer further aid in understanding the caves’ history.

**Avali** is more reckless and ambitious, eager to uncover the caves’ secrets and prove herself. If the crew sides with her or manages to clear the rockslide without major consequences, she will become a staunch ally. However, if her approach backfires, she’ll have to confront the consequences of her impatience, potentially leading to personal growth or regret.

---

### **Impact on the Festival**
If the crew investigates and stabilizes the pulse, they’ll uncover the ancient power source, securing an **artifact** that will serve as the festival’s **centerpiece**, enhancing the cultural significance of the event.

If they fail or rush through the situation, the festival will proceed but lack the gravitas of an ancient discovery. The players will still be praised for their efforts, but there will be a sense of “what could have been” hanging over the celebration.

### **Foreshadowing the Festival**
As **Kethras** and **Avali** debate the next steps, **Lana** (from the previous Floating Garden encounter) arrives, revealing that the festival centerpiece is causing her stress. She hopes the crew will uncover something truly special here that can ease her worries and make the festival a resounding success. This hints at the importance of the players' actions in shaping the festival's outcome.
