### **1. Issresh (Aandrisk Sculptor) - He/Him**
- **Booking Message:**  
  "Greetings! Issresh of Seken Feather-Family here. I’ve heard wonderful things about your retreat and am eager to join you all in exploring new creative energies! I’ll be bringing some of my latest kinetic sculptures to work on, and I can’t wait to see what the communal spirit of the retreat inspires. Looking forward to shared meals, long conversations, and, of course, art! See you soon!"
  
- **Specialty:** Kinetic sculpture using Aandrisk feathers integrated into moving art.
- **Personality:** Social, energetic, charismatic, but hiding grief beneath his exuberance.
- **Reason for Attending:** Issresh has felt creatively stagnant after the recent loss of a feather-family member. He’s seeking a retreat to find new inspiration, but also to distract himself from dealing with the grief. He’s hoping the retreat will recharge his spirit and reconnect him to his creativity.
- **Conflict/Quirk:** Issresh struggles with processing grief. He tends to bury his emotions under high-energy social interactions, preferring to entertain and distract others (and himself) rather than confront his feelings head-on. While he’s a natural leader and social butterfly, this constant need to stay "on" is taking its toll.

- **Preferences/Needs:**  
  Prefers a spacious studio or cargo hold area where he can work on his kinetic sculptures without being cramped. Enjoys communal meals and would like a spot near a window or viewport to keep connected to the outside world, even if it's through space.

### **2. Tupo (Laru Novelist) - He/Him**
- **Booking Message:**  
  "Hello. My name is Tupo. I’ve been struggling with the ending of a novel I’ve been working on for a while, and I’m hoping your retreat will help me find the clarity I need. I’m excited to be in an environment surrounded by other artists and nature. I appreciate quiet spaces for reflection, but I’m also open to sharing ideas and stories with other attendees. Thank you for the opportunity."
  
- **Specialty:** Writing experimental fiction with themes of forgotten species and rewilding.
- **Personality:** Introspective, shy, and quiet, yet curious about other people.
- **Reason for Attending:** Tupo has reached a point in his novel where he’s hesitant to move forward, feeling that the ending will be a significant emotional milestone for him. He believes that being around other creative minds, especially those with experience in finality and closure, will help him finish his story. Deep down, he’s seeking reassurance that endings don’t have to be negative.
- **Conflict/Quirk:** Tupo is deeply afraid of endings—both in his creative work and in life. This fear makes him reluctant to finish his novel, as he equates the completion of a story with personal loss. He frequently retreats into his writing as a way of avoiding difficult emotions, which sometimes leaves him feeling disconnected from others.

- **Preferences/Needs:**  
  Requests a quiet, secluded room with access to natural lighting or a calming, artificial light setup to simulate natural light. He’d like to be near a cozy corner with minimal foot traffic, as he prefers solitude for writing and reflection.

### **3. Brehem Tosh’sek (Harmagian Cultural Historian) - He/Him**
- **Booking Message:**  
  "Greetings. My name is Brehem Tosh’sek, and I am honored to join your esteemed retreat. I specialize in the preservation of lost art forms, particularly those of ancient cultures now extinct. I am eager to meet fellow artists and scholars who value the significance of history in art. This retreat sounds like an excellent opportunity to exchange knowledge and push my work in new directions."
  
- **Specialty:** Preservation of lost and extinct cultural art forms.
- **Personality:** Intellectual, respectful of tradition, occasionally pedantic but open-minded.
- **Reason for Attending:** Brehem is attending the retreat to reinvigorate his work and find new ways to incorporate lost traditions into the contemporary art scene. He feels that modern artists often overlook the lessons of the past, and he hopes to foster a dialogue between the old and new, learning as much as he teaches.
- **Conflict/Quirk:** Brehem struggles with balancing his reverence for tradition with the need to embrace change. He is caught between preserving the past and recognizing that art, like culture, must evolve. This inner tension often manifests in moments of rigidity where he might resist modern interpretations or practices that he perceives as too distant from the historical record.

- **Preferences/Needs:**  
  Requires a climate-controlled space due to Harmagian sensitivity to temperature changes. He needs access to digital archives and prefers a workspace that allows him to spread out physical artifacts or scrolls for reference.

### **4. Zoya Draven (Human Performance Artist) - She/Her**
- **Booking Message:**  
  "Hi! Zoya Draven here. I’m really looking forward to your retreat—I need some time away to reconnect with the roots of my work. I’ve been working on a new performance piece that involves ritualistic dance and storytelling, and I’m hoping this retreat will spark some new inspiration. Can’t wait to meet the other attendees and see what everyone else is working on!"
  
- **Specialty:** Ritualistic dance and storytelling with a focus on immersive performance.
- **Personality:** Passionate, outgoing, and deeply connected to her work, though sometimes unaware of personal boundaries.
- **Reason for Attending:** Zoya is seeking to reawaken her spiritual connection to her performance work. She feels disconnected from the deeper purpose behind her pieces and hopes that this retreat will help her rediscover that missing element. She’s also looking for fresh inspiration from the natural world and other artists.
- **Conflict/Quirk:** Zoya often struggles with recognizing personal boundaries—both her own and others'. She tends to immerse people in her art before they’re ready, sometimes overwhelming them with her intensity. Her challenge at the retreat will be to find balance between passion and respect for others’ emotional space.

- **Preferences/Needs:**  
  Requires a large, clear space to practice her performance art and ritual dances. She requests access to a variety of materials that could inspire her work, such as different textures and surfaces. A cargo hold or lounge could suffice if cleared for movement.

### **5. Vann Ishri (Aeluon Painter) - Xe/Xyr (shon)**
- **Booking Message:**  
  "Hello. My name is Vann Ishri. I’m an abstract painter, and I work with minimalist cosmic landscapes. I’m hoping to explore more interactive forms of art during this retreat, particularly the integration of my work with technology. I look forward to a peaceful and inspiring time with the group and the opportunity to push my creative boundaries."
  
- **Specialty:** Abstract painting inspired by cosmic landscapes.
- **Personality:** Quiet, introspective, and often emotionally distant due to xyr discomfort in social settings.
- **Reason for Attending:** Vann is attending to push xyrself creatively and experiment with new forms of art that incorporate interactive elements. Xe is also hoping to use the retreat as a way to quietly observe and recharge, though xe secretly yearns for a deeper connection with others.
- **Conflict/Quirk:** Vann struggles with emotional expression. Xe tends to rely on the colors of xyr cheeks to display xyr emotions rather than engaging in direct conversation. Xe often feels detached from others, which xe masks with aloofness, but deep down, xe desires more personal connection and validation.

- **Preferences/Needs:**  
  Prefers dim lighting and sensory-controlled environments to help with xyr concentration. Xe needs access to holo-projectors or any technology that allows xyr to create shifting, interactive art. Xe would appreciate a small but flexible space to experiment with new ideas.

### **6. Thresh Haal (Quelin Composer) - She/Her**
- **Booking Message:**  
  "To whom it may concern,  
  I am Thresh Haal, a composer. I am interested in attending the retreat as I find myself at a crossroads in my work. I seek to explore new, less structured forms of music—something outside my usual parameters. I expect a quiet, focused atmosphere conducive to productive work. I trust this retreat will offer such an environment."
  
- **Specialty:** Experimental music and composition.
- **Personality:** Methodical and precise, but yearning to explore more spontaneous, chaotic forms of music.
- **Reason for Attending:** Thresh feels trapped within the rigid structures of her compositions and is hoping to break free by exploring more improvisational and less traditional music. She’s drawn to the idea of creating something unpredictable and wants to challenge herself to take risks musically.
- **Conflict/Quirk:** Thresh’s biggest challenge is her internal struggle between control and chaos. Her tendency toward perfectionism often holds her back from letting go and fully embracing spontaneous creation, which she finds both thrilling and terrifying.

- **Preferences/Needs:**  
  Requires an acoustically isolated or sound-proofed room for composing. A small, quiet space with access to digital music equipment or synthesizers would be ideal for her to experiment with new compositions without outside noise interference.

### **7. Sathi Marren (Coriolan Glassblower) - She/Xe**
- **Booking Message:**  
  "Hello, I’m Sathi Marren, and I’d like to reserve a spot at your upcoming retreat.

I’m hoping the retreat will give me some new perspectives and allow me to expand my artistic practice. Looking forward to joining you all."
  
- **Specialty:** Glassblowing with a focus on delicate sculptures that capture light and motion.
- **Personality:** Humble, avoids the spotlight, but deeply passionate about her craft.
- **Reason for Attending:** Sathi has felt stuck in her usual routines and wants to break free from her established artistic habits. She’s attending the retreat to seek new perspectives and explore different approaches to glassblowing, hoping to reignite the creative spark that’s been missing from her recent work.
- **Conflict/Quirk:** Sathi often undervalues her own talent, deflecting praise and avoiding the recognition she deserves. While she’s confident in her technical skills, she doubts her ability to innovate, fearing that she’s hit a plateau in her artistic growth.

- **Preferences/Needs:**  
  Would love a private workspace with ventilation due to the nature of glassblowing, though xe understands the ship’s limitations. Xe prefers to work in a space with a clear view of others, as xe draws inspiration from watching the interactions of others on board.

- **Specialty:** Traditional Harmagian textile arts, with a focus on intricate woven patterns.
- **Personality:** Fastidious, respectful of tradition, and deeply focused, but curious about modern techniques.
- **Reason for Attending:** Mekh’ren is looking to expand his work by integrating modern techniques and ideas without compromising the integrity of his traditional methods. He hopes the retreat will provide inspiration for new ways to blend old and new practices while deepening his appreciation for other cultures’ art forms.
- **Conflict/Quirk:** Mekh'ren is caught between his desire to innovate and his reverence for traditional practices. He sometimes feels conflicted about whether experimenting with modern techniques dilutes the cultural significance of his work, which leads to creative blocks.

- **Specialty:** Storytelling and archiving the history of the Exodan Fleet.
- **Personality:** Warm, personable, and deeply reflective, with a love for shared stories.
- **Reason for Attending:** Yek is hoping to find new ways of sharing the stories xe has collected over the years.

Xe looks forward to trading stories and exploring new storytelling techniques.
- **Conflict/Quirk:** Yek often feels burdened by the responsibility of preserving cultural memory. Xe is constantly aware of how much depends on xyr accuracy in recording and telling these stories, which sometimes prevents xe from enjoying the process and seeing storytelling as a living, evolving art.

- **Preferences/Needs:**  
  Would like a quiet and cozy space with access to a large display or projection area for storytelling sessions. Xe would prefer a space where xe can gather small groups for intimate storytelling without disturbing others.
