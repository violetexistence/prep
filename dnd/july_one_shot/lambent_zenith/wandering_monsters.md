Characters can forgo the portals and travel between the wreck segments on their own, either by walking or by flying. The segments are 300 feet from each other.

The areas between the segments contain a multitude of hungry astral predators. The creatures trapped in the segments donâ€™t traverse the wreck for this reason. When the characters enter one of these areas, roll on the Random Wreck Encounters table to see what confronts the characters.
