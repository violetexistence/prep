_(Figaro paces back and forth in the stateroom, looking over his shoulder and muttering to himself. He’s agitated, but his paranoia comes across as cold calculation, eyes darting suspiciously between the party members as they try to speak with him.)_

> “Don’t think I’m not aware of what’s happening here. I’ve already considered all the variables. The ship breaks apart, Ilren shows up, and suddenly _I’m_ the one hiding in my quarters? You’re thinking it’s just the strain, aren’t you? Poor Figaro, lost his nerve, doesn’t trust a soul… Well, you’d be wrong. There’s something else, something… wrong inside my own mind.”

_(He narrows his eyes, pacing closer to a desk covered in papers, and taps a finger on a leather-bound journal.)_

> “This. _This_ blasted thing. A journal entry in my own hand, dated four days ago, but I have _no memory_ of writing it. I remember everything about that day. I cataloged supplies, I spoke with Kycera—hell, I even reorganized the galley stores because they were a mess. But there’s nothing about this… conversation.”

_(His voice drops to a whisper, and he leans in closer.)_

> “It describes a meeting I _know_ I never had. With _someone_ I would _never_ meet alone. Yet, here it is, in my own bloody handwriting. And if I can’t trust my own memory, then who’s pulling the strings?”  

**Journal Entry (Figaro’s Personal Log)**

_(The entry is written in neat, deliberate handwriting, dated four days ago, but the ink is slightly smudged in places, as if the hand that wrote it trembled.)_

`“I met with Ilren today. We spoke in private, discussing the ship’s status and next steps. He’s still playing the giff role well enough, and the crew seems convinced, but I know he’s hiding something. There’s no way he made it this far without an ulterior motive. What is he after?`

`We talked logistics. He mentioned needing to check the prow again. I told him that could wait. Too much risk with the crew on edge. But he insisted. Something about his manner… it unsettles me. Why can’t I shake this feeling?`

`Regardless, I agreed to send him out tomorrow. I don’t trust him. But there’s something about him… something that feels _familiar._”`

# Reaction to the Journal Entry

_(As the party reads the journal, Figaro watches their reactions closely, his paranoia making him hyper-vigilant.)_

> “There. You see it now, don’t you? I _never_ met with Ilren alone. Never. And yet there’s my handwriting, clear as day, recording a meeting I have no memory of. My own mind is betraying me, and that’s how I know someone’s been meddling. My memory’s been _rearranged_—altered like a damn puzzle someone’s pulled apart and pieced back together wrong.”

## Other Missing Memories

> “Where is my note on Redbud’s repairs, or Daveras’s schedule to scout the lower deck? I would never leave that to chance, and yet the last three shifts feel like they never happened.”

> “I know I was supposed to sign off on the security protocols for the prow—the safe room containing the Rod piece. It’s my _job_ to know that sequence by heart. Yet I can’t remember if we engaged the final lock.”

> “Captain Inda and I had a plan. A contingency for emergencies like this… But the last thing I remember her saying is that we’d reconvene after the crash. I know there must’ve been more. Why can’t I remember?”

> “I should know _exactly_ where the Rod piece is—it’s my responsibility as first mate. But every time I try to remember where it’s stored, it feels like my thoughts slip through my fingers. It’s as if someone’s _scrubbed_ the memory clean.”

> “I can remember _seeing_ the ship come apart, but the details—the critical ones about where the fragments landed—it’s as if they’ve been erased. How can I strategize if I don’t even know what’s left of the ship?”

> “Kycera says we had a meeting about rationing supplies two days ago. But I don’t recall any such conversation. How am I supposed to lead this crew if I can’t even remember giving them their orders?”
