Daveras, the gruff yet friendly druid, is someone who’s found solace in the simple things after facing loss and hardship. His blink dog companion, Ikasa, and the treant Redbud are his anchors, and despite being trapped on the Lambent Zenith, he maintains a grounded, practical outlook. Daveras is direct but not without warmth, speaking with the kind of casual frankness you’d expect from someone used to dealing with nature rather than politics or deception.  

## Playing Cards

(shuffling cards at the table, not looking up)

“Figured you’d turn up eventually. Cards are always more fun with company… assuming you’re not lookin’ to start trouble.”  

(He glances up, taking a measure of the party before leaning back in his chair, arms crossed.)  


“Strange place, isn’t it? Feels like the whole wreck’s just hangin’ by a thread. The Astral Sea’s a weird enough place on its own, but this? It’s like livin’ in the belly of a dead god. Ain’t exactly the retirement plan I had in mind.”  

(He deals another round, then gestures toward the surroundings.)  

“Got folks scattered all over the wreck, some still thinkin’ we can fix this mess. But the way I see it, we’re just floatin’ in limbo, waitin’ for the next big thing to come swallow us up. Hell of a way to spend your time, huh?”

(He picks up his cards, then smirks slightly.)  

## Missing His Friends

“But then again, I’ve got Redbud and Ikasa—could be worse. Least the company’s good. Speaking of which, you seen a reddish-brown blink dog around? That little troublemaker’s probably sniffin’ out some new mystery or gettin’ into places he shouldn’t.”

(Suddenly a bit more serious, Daveras lowers his voice.)

“Look, I don’t know what brought you here, but I’ll give you this for free: watch out for Ilren. Something’s off about that one. Been stirrin’ the pot since the moment they showed up. Just a gut feeling, but my gut’s kept me alive this long, so I trust it.”  

(He leans back in his chair again, a touch of humor returning.)

“Now, if you’re stickin’ around, we can always use an extra hand. And if you’re just passin’ through… well, try not to get eaten by the next big monster that crawls out of the woodwork. This wreck’s got plenty of those.”
