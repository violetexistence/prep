Captain Inda is a strong-willed, confident leader, but the crash and the loss of much of her ship have left her feeling deeply vulnerable. She struggles between wanting to maintain control and accepting the reality that her once-unstoppable ship is now in pieces. Her sense of duty is unwavering, and she’s highly focused on recovering the Rod piece, but she has a strong moral code and cares for her crew. Despite her injuries, her pride and command presence are still evident.

- Inda hides her physical pain (her broken wing and prosthetic leg) well, but a close observer might notice her wincing if she moves too quickly or applies pressure to her leg.
- She speaks with authority, rarely letting her guard down. However, when talking about her crew, especially the survivors, her voice softens.
- Inda is no-nonsense in battle strategies and logistics but may grow frustrated when things get out of her control.

> *But poetry won’t save my crew. Or that blasted Rod. We’ll have to do that ourselves.”*

> _“The Rod piece? Yes, I know exactly where it is—buried deep in the heart of Havock. But you can’t just walk in. It’s sealed tight, and those wards were designed to keep out beings far more dangerous than you.”_

> _“You’ll need the passphrase to disable the wards, and you’ll need me to get you close enough to use it. Do not mistake me for some broken relic of the past. I am still Captain Inda Malayuri, and this ship will fly again, no matter the cost.”_

## The Crash

> _“I take full responsibility for everything on this ship. If you think I’m to blame, you’ve clearly forgotten that the multiverse is a cruel place for the unprepared.”_
