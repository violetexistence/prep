## Tone

Ikasa’s dialogue can shift between lighthearted and insightful, offering guidance but never too heavy-handed, with a tone of knowing amusement at the chaos of the Astral Sea. He’d be a great companion to the party while injecting some levity into the darker moments of the adventure.

## **Initial Meeting:**  

Ikasa bounds up, tail wagging, crystals on his collar shimmering as he speaks in a smooth, calm tone, quite at odds with his energetic movements:

“Ah, travelers! You don’t seem like the type to be eaten by grells… or at least, not quickly. Lucky for you, I have excellent timing. I’m Ikasa, as you can tell, a dog of impeccable taste and a nose for trouble.”

_He sits, tilting his head curiously._

“Now, what brings you to this _very_ questionable part of the multiverse?”

## **Sharing His Past:**  

If the players ask about his backstory, Ikasa’s voice becomes more thoughtful, but there’s still a sense of humor:

“Ah, the Verdant Branch… now _that_ was a ship! Sailing through the Astral Sea, no small feat, I’ll tell you. Daveras and I were inseparable, thick as thieves, if thieves were druids and blink dogs, of course. Then came the pirates—nasty business, really. I blinked out before things got ugly. But poor Daveras… he’s got no idea about Palenna. She’s probably out there somewhere, thinking we all forgot her. _Sigh_… mortals are so tragic sometimes.”

## **Offering Insight:**

When Ikasa shares a secret or crucial information, his tone shifts to one of empathy and understanding, but with a twinkle of mischief:

“You know… there’s something about your group that reminds me of my old crew. Determined, perhaps a bit reckless, but good-hearted. Just between us, I think you’ll find that not everything in this wreck is as it seems. Some creatures don’t want to be here any more than you do. If you know what I mean… but! I’ve said too much. You’ll see for yourselves soon enough.”

## **Humorous Quip:**

When things get tense, Ikasa might crack a joke, keeping spirits up:

“If anyone asks, I’ll be in charge of _not_ getting eaten, thank you very much. It’s an art, you know—dodging grell and slipping past cosmic horrors. I’ll teach you sometime, once we’re not, you know… dodging cosmic horrors.”
