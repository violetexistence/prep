Cirit has been living in hiding since seeing through Ilren’s deception, and her imprisonment has only heightened her sense of urgency. In her halfling form, she maintains a calm and almost saintly demeanor, though her true celestial nature often peeks through in subtle ways. She’s patient and wise but deeply wary of Ilren and frustrated that no one else has seen through the death slaad’s act.

- Cirit tends to speak in riddles or philosophical musings, giving off an air of otherworldly wisdom. She’s cryptic but not evasive.
- As a couatl, she exudes a gentle celestial presence, even in her halfling form. If players are perceptive, they may notice her knowing things she shouldn’t, or understanding too much about planar forces.
- She’s protective of the crew but also pragmatic. If she believes the players can handle Ilren, she will guide them, but if she senses danger, she’ll prioritize the safety of the crew.


> _“Oh, please, get me out of here before that monster returns. Ilren… he’s not what he seems. I confronted him, and… well, you can see how that went for me.”_

> _“I tried to warn Figaro, but that thing has its claws in him, too. His mind isn’t his own. None of them see it. They’re just following orders, but they don’t realize whose orders they’re following anymore.”_

> _“Do you feel it? This place… it’s more than just a wreck. There’s something here, something ancient stirring in Havock’s bones. I fear we’ve awakened it, and if that beast gets its hands on the Rod piece, we may see chaos reign again.”_

> _“There’s a purity in the truth. And right now, the truth is locked away, just like me. But the truth has a way of breaking free, don’t you think?”_

# Mention Ilren

> _“I’ve seen what lies beneath his smile, and it’s not something from this plane. We need to stop him before he tightens his grip on the others.”_

## Riddle Musing

> _“The stars above have no need for shadows… and yet we cast them, even here in this lightless place.”_

> _“I’ve always thought of truth like a river—smooth and unyielding, but it bends when it must, hiding its depths beneath the surface. What lies at the bottom of your river, I wonder?”_

> _“Time, they say, is the one thing that moves forward, even when we stand still. But here… here in this shattered place, I wonder if it too has lost its way.”_

> _“There’s a difference between surviving and living, wouldn’t you say? Some might say the gods have forgotten us, but I wonder if they’re merely waiting for us to remember them.”_

> _“This heart beats, but not with life—no, it beats with something else. Perhaps it is loss. Perhaps it is something far older, deeper, like the turning of the great wheel. Can you feel it too?”_

> _“Seven stars were born, but only six now shine. The seventh lies hidden, waiting for hands strong enough to carry its weight. Will you be the ones to reach out and grasp it, or will it slip like sand through your fingers?”_
