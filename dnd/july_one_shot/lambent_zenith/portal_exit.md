The crew of the _Lambent Zenith_ used the magic contained within the rod piece to create portals through which the ship could travel across the multiverse with ease. However, when the _Lambent Zenith_ approached Havock, the rod’s magic mixed with the latent power in Havock’s dying body and went awry. This volatile combination now causes teleportation spells and effects to function strangely in the segments of the shipwreck.

When a creature within a wreck segment casts a spell (or uses a similar magical effect) that would teleport it or another creature, instead of the normal effect, a 5-foot-diameter circular portal appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of the casting creature. The portal is a glowing ring filled with opaque mist and remains open for 1 minute.

When a portal appears, roll on the Portal Exit table to determine where the portal leads. If the result is where the characters already are, roll again. Any creature or object that passes through an open portal appears in a random unoccupied space in the exit location.
