Kycera Duskstride, the reformed pirate, has an air of rough practicality about her, combined with a sense of deep personal guilt. She’s got a no-nonsense attitude but is ultimately driven by a desire to make up for her past mistakes. She’s not one for flowery speeches or excuses, but her actions and words carry the weight of someone who’s lived with hard choices and regrets.
  
## In the Galley

(stirring something in the galley with focused precision, without looking up)

“Food’s ready in a few. Not that anyone here _needs_ it, but it’s the closest thing to comfort in this gods-forsaken wreck.”  

(She gives the stew a taste and shrugs.)  

(still working, glancing up at the party)

“You’re new here, huh? Figaro’s holed up again? No surprise. Guy’s lost it, poor fool. Can’t really blame him. Not after what Ilren’s been puttin’ him through. Keep your wits about you when you go near him. He’s jumpier than a cat on hot coals.”

(She leans against the counter, wiping her hands, giving the party a long, measured look.)

## Confiding

(a touch of steel in her voice)

“Look, I don’t know what brings you to this wreck, and frankly, I don’t care. But if you’re gonna be pokin’ around, do us all a favor: watch your back. This place ain’t just a heap of broken timbers. It’s a feeding ground for all sorts of nightmares, and not just the ones in the shadows.”

# Her Past

(She hesitates for a moment, then adds with a grim smile.)

“I wasn’t always the ‘upstanding citizen’ you see before you. Spent my fair share of time on the other side of the law. Pirates don’t get second chances often, but I’m here, makin’ up for what I can. Maybe it’s too late for me. But it’s not too late for you, so… tread carefully, alright?”
