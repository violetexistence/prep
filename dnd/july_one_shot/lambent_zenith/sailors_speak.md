**Boris “Bear” Volkov**: _“I do not trust this mission Ilren has us running. One of these days, he sends us out, and we don’t come back. Maybe that’s plan, da?”_

**Anya “Flame” Petrovna**: _“Hah, you think he tries to get rid of us, Bear? Not sure he needs to try so hard—this place will do it for him. Every time I step outside, I think, ‘Hm, today’s the day I get eaten.’”_

**Igor “Ox” Sergeyev**: _“Better to be eaten by beast than sit here, rotting slowly in this void.”_

**Katya “Ghost” Ivanova**: _“If Ilren doesn’t send us into danger, we might as well already be ghosts. Wandering this ship, fading away. At least danger keeps us… alive.”_

**Viktor “Vik” Drago**: _“Come now, Ghost, that’s little too bleak, even for you. We’ll find a way out. Ilren keeps us busy for reason. Or at least I hope there is reason…”_

**Boris “Bear” Volkov**: _“You’re fool if you think he works toward anything, Vik. All I see is giff with fancy spyglass and no plan.”_

**Anya “Flame” Petrovna**: _“Vik’s got hope, Bear. Let him keep it, eh? One of us should.”_

**Igor “Ox” Sergeyev**: _“Hope won’t stop beast Ilren sends our way next. I am tired of chasing his pointless orders into dark.”_

**Katya “Ghost” Ivanova**: _“We are pawns, Vik. If Ilren had real plan, we wouldn’t be sitting here, waiting. Just wish I knew what game he plays.”_
