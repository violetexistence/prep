## Touching the Blood

*As the blood pulses in your hand, a wave of ancient power surges through your mind. Dark skies split by arcs of violet lightning. Amid the storm, a towering figure laughs—its many limbs dancing in reckless abandon, scattering debris and flame in its wake. Strange, intricate symbols swirl around the figure: a gauntleted hand, a gleaming shield, and a shattered blade, each flickering like embers caught in the wind.*  

*For a brief moment, you see a path once followed—now forgotten, broken—and hear a song, both mournful and exultant, echoing through the void. Then, silence.*

...new secret learned!
