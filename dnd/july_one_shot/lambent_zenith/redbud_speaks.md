Calm, slow, with deep care for life, yet a bit cryptic and whimsical. Being a treant, they might have a long-winded, nature-centric perspective but also a sense of humor that comes with age and patience. Redbud’s wisdom is often hidden in seemingly unrelated or meandering thoughts, but they always come back to the heart of the matter.

Redbud would be cryptic about some things but might offer guidance in his slow, nature-infused way. There’s a weight to his words, a connection to the world that’s older than most realize. He doesn’t see time the way others do, but he knows what is coming and what has already been, and his immunity to N’Zoth’s influence makes him a unique resource for the party. Redbud would leave the players with a sense that they’re standing on the edge of something both ancient and profound, a secret that even the stars have forgotten.

## On Meeting

  >_“Mmm… strangers. Strangers walking the bones of gods, heh. I haven’t seen new faces in… well… it’s hard to say how long, really. The roots remember, but my mind, it tends to wander… like the branches do.”_

>  _“But you’re here, aren’t you? Looking for something, as all wanderers do. Yes, yes, I can tell. The heart pulls on you too, doesn’t it? Tick… tick… tick… even the god can’t help but stir.”_

## Asking About the Shipwreck

>  _“Oh, the wreck? Yes, yes, it’s been here for… a time. It was a beautiful thing once, bright sails like golden leaves, gliding through the sea of stars. But now? Oh, the ship’s just another part of the roots, tangled and woven into this old god. We grow together, yes. But the heart… the heart is still alone. The heart… well… it still remembers.”_ 

## On Havock

>  _“Ahh, Havock. Once, it was all about freedom, chaos. Like a storm that never rests. But the world, the people—they didn’t want storms anymore. They wanted shelter, structure, rules. Havock’s winds stopped blowing, and, well, here we are.”_

>  _“The heart beats, but it’s quieter now… like a whisper in the woods when all the animals have gone. If you listen close… you can still hear its song. Heh… but what would you do with that song, I wonder? Change it, or let it change you?”_

## N'Zoth, Strange Occurences

>  _“Hmm… there’s something… something odd in the air. It’s not the heart, no… something else… like a shadow stretching itself over the roots, trying to cover what was. You feel it, don’t you? That crawling in the back of your mind? It wants you to forget. But me? Heh… I’m rooted too deep for that. Roots go where shadows can’t.”_

>  _“The world’s being rewritten, like a tree forced to grow in a new shape. It’s subtle… quiet… until it isn’t. Some memories just… blink out. You’re here now, but will you be in the story tomorrow? Careful. Don’t lose yourself to what wants to rewrite you. Hold onto who you are, like a tree holding its ground against the storm.”_
