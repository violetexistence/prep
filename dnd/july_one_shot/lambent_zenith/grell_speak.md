Grell speech is quite a mix of eerie and absurd, given their alien nature. Picture a combination of a soft, wet slithering sound—like tentacles dragging across stone—interspersed with sharp, abrupt clicks and high-pitched hisses, as if they’re trying to imitate speech but haven’t quite mastered it. Their words might occasionally be followed by squelchy gurgles, as if their thoughts are bubbling up through their strange biology.  

When using magic to understand them, those sounds would become translated into oddly formal, almost pompous speech. The weird contrast between their unsettling noises and the exaggerated civility of their conversations—about beak polish or intricate tentacle care rituals—would be both creepy and hilarious!  

## Re: Food

**Grell 1**: _“I sensed another one. It walked funny, didn’t it? Delicious…but it had shoes.”_  

**Grell 2**: _“Ugh, shoes. Ruin the texture. Always with the shoes.”_

**Grell 1**: _“Remember the one with the shiny helmet? Crunch, crunch—no brain. Just hollow. What’s the point of a head if there’s no snack inside?”_

**Grell 2**: _“Fashion, maybe? I think they like looking bigger. You know, like us with our tentacles.”_ 

**Grell 1**: _“Tentacles are practical. Helmets are nonsense. Next time, we wait for a bare-headed one. I’m still picking metal bits out of my beak from that last fellow.”_  

**Grell 3** (grumbling from the side): _“Why do we always wait? We should float closer. I’m starving! I can hear them thinking… smells like… arrogance?”_  

**Grell 2**: _“Patience, patience. You know how it goes. First, they think they’re safe, and then… schlorp! Tentacle surprise.”_  

**Grell 1**: _“Fine, but no more wizards. They always taste like books. Boring.”_ 

## Re: Grooming

_Grell 1_: “_Ah, Drezith, have you tried the new beak polish? The one made from crushed star angler scales?_” 

_Grell 2_: “_Mmm, exquisite! I find it really brings out the shine in my beak. You know, if you don’t keep it pristine, one might mistake you for a common scavver!_”  

_Grell 3_ (a little smug): “_Amateurs. I coat mine in a thin layer of astral dew collected at dawn. The natural shimmer is unparalleled, and it’s good for digestion, too._”  

_Grell 1_ (clearly impressed): “_Ah, always the connoisseur. But do tell, what do you use to detangle your tentacles? Mine keep getting snagged on debris—so terribly undignified._”  

_Grell 2_: “_I use a simple mix of oozes and jellyfish slime. It’s so soothing. Keeps the barbs sharp and supple too. You wouldn’t want them to look frayed now, would you?_”  

_Grell 3_ (exasperated): “_Frayed tentacles! The horror! It’s like showing up to a hunt with a chipped beak!_”
