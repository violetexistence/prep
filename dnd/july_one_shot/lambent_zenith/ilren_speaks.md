## The Adventurer

(leaning on the railing, squinting through his spyglass)

>“Ah, look at that beauty over there, mate. That’s a proper star angler, that one. See the way it just floats there, waiting for a snack to stumble by? Magnificent, really. Nature’s perfect ambush predator. Gotta admire the simplicity, eh?”

(patting his spyglass)

>“Picked this little beaut up in the Feywild. They make ‘em proper there, y’know? Helps me keep track of all the, uh, local wildlife. Not that we’re in any danger. Nah, just part of the natural order, right? You’ve gotta respect the circle of life—even in a dead god’s guts, eh?”

## On Wildlife

(watching a cloaker slink through the wreckage)

>“Ah, mate, look at that. Cloaker, right? Now, _there’s_ an underrated species. People call ‘em monsters, but they’re just misunderstood, really. It’s just trying to get by, y’know? Survive, eat, reproduce. Reminds me of my days in the jungles of Chult—big ol’ carnivorous ferns everywhere, and people were all ‘Ilren, mate, we’re gonna die!’ But I was like, ‘Nah, nah, they’re just a bit peckish!’”  

(noticing a grell in the distance)

>“Crikey! That’s a grell, that is. Bobbing along like a brain with a beak. Fascinatin’ creatures. You don’t see ‘em too often, but when you do, you’ve gotta just sit back and admire the craftsmanship. Tentacles for days, mate. Now, some folks would run, but me? I like to think they’re just sayin’ g’day in their own special way.”  

## Sus

(leaning on his spyglass, still casual)

>“Ah, there she is, that grell again, just hoverin’ about like she owns the place. You really gotta respect the natural order, y’know? Sometimes it’s eat or be eaten out here, right mates? Heh, ‘course, you lot wouldn’t know much about that just yet. But no worries, I’ve got it all under control.”

(He lowers the spyglass and turns to the party, his expression still friendly, but there’s a strange gleam in his eyes.)

## True Face

(with a slow grin)

> “See, the thing is… sometimes, the predators aren’t just outside the wreck. Sometimes… they’re right here. And me? Oh, I’ve been enjoyin’ the show, but all good things, eh? Time to stop playin’ the nice guy.”

*Ilren’s voice drops into a deep, guttural growl, his jovial demeanor dissolving into something far more sinister. His body begins to distort and warp, revealing the grotesque, hulking form of a **death slaad**. His skin darkens to a sickly green-gray, his teeth lengthening into jagged fangs.*  

(now fully transformed, grinning with wicked glee)

>"Truth is, I’m not really here for the view. I’m here for you. And trust me, mate, the local wildlife? They’ve got _nothin’_ on me.”
