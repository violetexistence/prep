_“Za’vedd t’rornor dras-t’ae soliss stiv,_
_Tha thrarz hiras t’stiv’dorn._
_Hirras-drith az T’rond, zhirras-dras Hirra zhurir,_
_Draz z’roda t’rora zhirras do’alund.”_

“To weave a path through fortune’s snare,
Three steps are laid with utmost care.
Wealth to Time, and Time to Fate,
Tread this path to seal your fate.”
