**d100** **Destination** **Description**

01-05 **Demonweb Pits** You land amidst the shifting, infinite webs of Lolth’s domain. A nearby drider patrol notices your presence immediately.

06-10 **Sigil - The City of Doors** You appear in a crowded Sigil marketplace. A portal flickers behind you—it will close in 1 minute. The Lady of Pain notices _everything_.

11-15 **The Abyss - Layer 66** The chaotic swamp of the Demon Lord Juiblex greets you, thick with acidic ooze. You’re knee-deep in trouble already.

16-20 **Feywild Garden** You land in an overgrown fey garden with giant mushrooms. Time flows strangely here—1 hour here might be a day or a second outside.

21-25 **Random Dungeon Corridor** You find yourselves in the middle of an ancient dungeon. An adventuring party spots you… and mistakes you for their enemies!

26-30 **City of Menzoberranzan** You emerge in a noble drow household’s shrine to Lolth. A sacrificial ceremony is in progress—oops!

31-35 **Candlekeep Library** You materialize in a quiet, candlelit hall filled with ancient tomes. A stern librarian stares at you over their spectacles.

36-40 **Astral Sea** You float amidst glowing stars and the debris of forgotten worlds. Something colossal swims nearby.

41-45 **Underdark Cavern - Gracklstugh** You’re surrounded by duergar soldiers, who demand to know your allegiance. Things will get violent if you don’t answer correctly.

46-50 **Tavern in Waterdeep** You appear mid-brawl in a rowdy tavern. A chair flies towards your head. Roll initiative!

51-55 **Pandemonium** Deafening winds tear at your sanity, and the ground shifts beneath your feet. Finding a way out will not be easy.

56-60 **Lolth’s Silk Chamber** You land directly in Lolth’s private lair, surrounded by towering spider-silk cocoons. She has noticed your arrival…

61-65 **Mechanus** You appear on a vast metal cog, rotating slowly in an infinite machine. A nearby modron speaks to you in a language you cannot understand.

66-70 **Prime Material World - Aboard a Ship** You land on the deck of a sailing ship in the middle of a storm. The crew thinks you’re stowaways—or worse.

71-75 **Yggdrasil - World Tree** You emerge on a giant tree branch, miles above the ground. Multiple portals shimmer among the leaves.

76-80 **Ethereal Plane** You float in the misty ether, surrounded by echoes of the past. Phantom figures whisper half-forgotten secrets in your ears.

81-85 **Lolth’s Brood Pit** You arrive in a deep cavern, teeming with thousands of eggs. A horde of spiderlings hatches just as you arrive. Good luck.

86-90 **A Tavern in Sigil** A friendly tiefling bartender hands you a drink. “Rough trip?” The bartender hints that this might not be your first time here…

91-93 **Your Own Timeline—But Different** You see an alternate version of yourselves in the midst of a failed heist, arguing. They disappear the moment they spot you.

94-96 **Spider Queen’s Vision** You don’t physically move but are struck with a terrible vision of **Lolth’s will**—you know something dark will soon come to pass.

97-98 **Right Back in Web’s Edge** You stumble back to your starting point, dizzy and disoriented, with no memory of where you just were. Suspicion advances by 1.

99-100 **Random Friendly Location** The GM picks or rolls for a friendly place from your campaign—perhaps an ally’s hideout or a fortuitous safe house.
