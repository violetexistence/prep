## Ril’sra Khal’d
*The Iron Web, Kalyss’s Loyalists*

**Kalyss T’risst** – Veteran Drow warrior, current commander of Web’s Edge. Cunning strategist and bitter rival of Velakith. She has earned respect through strength but maintains a precarious grip on power.

**Mardrith Rilynath** – Kalyss’s right hand, an elite Drow warrior. Pragmatic and fiercely loyal to Kalyss. He serves as her enforcer, deeply distrustful of Velakith’s camp.

**Oloris Zaphryn** – Drow scout, a shadow who sees Web’s Edge as a form of punishment. Dreams of leaving the outpost and is susceptible to offers of escape, whether from allies or enemies.

**Thalra Streea** – Drow fighter and battle tactician. While she respects Kalyss’s military prowess, she’s growing increasingly wary of her leader’s obsession with Velakith.

**Zaeran Korith** – Drow archer and lookout. Quietly loyal, Zaeran feels secure in his current position but is constantly observing, waiting for a shift in power.  

## _Il’haar Velg’larn_ 
*The Silken Fangs, Velakith’s Followers*

**Velakith Baenre** – Ambitious former commander, now second in command. She is ruthless in her quest to reclaim power from Kalyss and resents her demotion. Her followers are loyal, but tensions remain high.

**Vylira Faenril** – Manipulative Drow priestess and Velakith’s lieutenant. She is cunning with a gift for using magic to tilt power dynamics in Velakith’s favor, though she remains cautious about outright rebellion.

**Saeric Vlozz** – Drow assassin and poison expert. A quiet, lethal presence in Velakith’s camp, he is ready to strike if given the order. His devotion to Velakith is based on ambition rather than loyalty.

**Kaeleth Oloth** – Drow spy and information broker, excellent at gathering secrets within Web’s Edge. He dislikes Kalyss and sees Velakith’s camp as a stepping stone to future power, but he has no love for Velakith personally.    

## _Thalack Khal’d_
*The Red Web, Yochlol-Devotees*

**Torgon Greth** – Grimlock brute, enforcer of the Yochlol faction. He serves as a terrifying reminder of Lolth’s reach and is fanatically loyal, though intellectually limited.

**Kaessa Drulzan** – Drider sorcerer cursed by Lolth. She serves because she must, not out of loyalty. Secretly seeking ways to undo her curse, she is willing to make deals with anyone who can help her escape her fate.

**Nalsha Venuth** – Half-Drow priestess. Caught between her Drow heritage and non-Drow background, she broods over her fate at Web’s Edge and mistrusts both Kalyss and Velakith, offering a possible ally for outsiders.  

## Mercenary Companies

**Korvin Grahl** – Duergar scout and leader of a mercenary band. Motivated purely by greed, he is already in Velakith’s pocket but would switch sides if the payment is right.

**Zaltan Steelhewer** – Svirfneblin ranger, exiled from Blingdenstone. He serves Kalyss loyally, but he harbors deep resentment toward his exile and would turn against her if his past were exploited.

**Shorva Krezik** – Hobgoblin mercenary and a battle-hardened fighter. She cares little about the Drow’s politics, staying loyal to Kalyss only for the money. Pragmatic and willing to switch sides for the right deal.  

## Other Agents

**Ylellith** – A Yochlol (Lolth’s demon enforcer). While she appears indifferent to the power struggles between Velakith and Kalyss, she is secretly manipulating events to ensure Lolth’s plans are carried out. She represents the ultimate authority.

**Essra Xaerith** – A Drow noble who was exiled to Web’s Edge as punishment. She despises both Kalyss and Velakith but lacks the power to act on her hatred. She might be open to an alliance with the right party if it means escape or revenge.
