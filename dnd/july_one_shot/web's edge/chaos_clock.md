The **Strands of Lolth** are thin planar threads that **weave through multiple realities**, connecting Web’s Edge to **various places across the multiverse**. Only **those in Lolth’s favor** can reliably navigate the Strands. The **Strands appear as small webbed holes** in the walls, ceilings, or floor of Web’s Edge, twisting inwards into narrow tunnels before leading elsewhere. These **portals are unstable**—they shift without warning, and not even the cultists always know where they’ll open.

**Gameplay Mechanics for the Strands of Lolth**
  
1. **Enemy Reinforcements through Strands:**
2. **Players Can Use the Strands:** 
	- **Each time the suspicion track advances**, roll a **d6**. On a 4–6, **new agents** emerge through the Strands.
	- **Example Reinforcement Group:**
		- 2 Drow Scouts + 1 Giant Spider
		- 1 Glabrezu
		- 1 Mage + 2 Grimlock soldiers
	- If the players discover **how to manipulate the Strands** (perhaps through a magic item or a successful **Arcana (DC 18)** or **Insight (DC 20)** check), they can **escape or reposition through the tunnels**, emerging in another part of the complex **(DM’s choice or roll on a table).**
3. **Chaotic Destinations:**
	- On **failed Strand navigation**, the players end up **somewhere unexpected**—maybe **a far-off Underdark city**, a **Demonweb Pit**, or even a **different plane entirely**.
	- Roll a **d100 table** to determine where they appear if things go catastrophically wrong.
4. **Stealth Through the Strands:**
	- PCs might use the **Strands to avoid patrols**, but it’s risky. They’ll need to **navigate without getting caught mid-transit.**  

**The Chaos Clock of Lolth**

The **Chaos Clock** is a mechanical and arcane wonder located in **W3 (Summoning Chamber)**. It has many spinning gears, **shifting web-like patterns** suspended between rings, and glowing dials covered in **Undercommon runes**. The clock appears to **tick according to no rational pattern**, with gears moving in fits and starts, reversing, or stopping for minutes before resuming.

**Cultists and demons believe that only those closest to Lolth** can read meaning in its erratic movements. When Lolth’s agents are about to arrive via the **Strands**, the **clock chimes**, alerting the denizens to prepare for visitors.

**The Chaos Clock’s Abilities**

1. **Reading the Clock (for Players):**
	- **Arcana (DC 22)** or **Insight (DC 25)** check allows a PC to **glean some of the Spider Queen’s plans**. On success, they gain **advantage on their next deception or stealth roll** against a drow or demon in Web’s Edge.
	- On a **natural 20**: The PC has an **epiphany**—a brief, divine hint about the location of a secret entrance, escape route, or a key NPC’s plans.
2. **When the Clock Chimes:**
	- Whenever the **suspicion track advances**, the Chaos Clock **emits a discordant chime**, giving all enemies **advantage on Perception rolls** for 1 hour.
3. **Unpredictable Time Shifts:**
	- The **clock randomly speeds up or slows down**. When the players spend too long in a specific area, the clock **“steals” time**, causing patrols or reinforcements to arrive earlier than expected.
	- **DM Mechanic:** You can **skip forward on the suspicion track** if the players are taking too long—use the clock as a narrative device to **increase urgency**.
4. **Clock Complication (High Suspicion):**
	- When suspicion reaches **5 or higher**, the clock begins to **go haywire**. It sends out brief **illusory visions** across the complex—players and NPCs alike may glimpse **events from the future**, leading to **disorienting false warnings** or **preemptive attacks.**

**Using the Chaos Clock in the Heist**

**Player Strategies:**

- Players might **observe the clock** to anticipate guard rotations or **avoid patrols**, but every attempt to read it comes with **risks of misinterpretation**. The **clock is just as likely to confuse as it is to help.**

**DM Strategies:**

- Use the **clock’s unpredictability to heighten tension**. Example:
- A player studies the clock and sees **two drow mages** will walk through **W5 (Guardian Chamber)** in the next two minutes—but **when they arrive**, they are **escorting a glabrezu** they weren’t expecting.
- Another time, the clock **shows the PCs being discovered and chased—** only for the vision to dissolve into **nothingness.**

**Multiple Entrances via Strands & Clock Impact**

With **multiple entrances**, the denizens of Web’s Edge are **never surprised** by visitors—but that doesn’t mean they’re always prepared. When the **chaos clock chimes**, everyone scrambles to make the hideout presentable.

1. **Entrance Locations:**
	- Each **Strand entrance** leads to a **new room or tunnel**, with **webbed portals** hidden in the walls, floors, or ceilings.
2. **Random Portal Appearance:** When the **suspicion track reaches 4+,** additional **Strands activate**, potentially unleashing dangerous **reinforcements**.
3. **Changing Guard Routes:**
	- Guards now move according to the **clock’s whims** rather than predictable patterns, meaning the **players can’t rely on prior observation**. The DM should **vary patrol movements**, making each run unpredictable.  

**Narrative Hooks: Flavorful NPC Interactions**  

1. **Makubli and Torkner (W2) Interpret the Clock:**
	- These two **rival agents** believe they can **read the Chaos Clock better than the other.** If the PCs infiltrate as drow, Makubli might **misinterpret the chime**, sending guards the wrong way, giving the players an **unexpected opening**.
2. **Clock Malfunction (Triggered by Players):**
	- Players might **sabotage the clock**—cutting the webs or dislodging gears could result in **chaotic effects**, such as teleporting enemies to the wrong locations, or even **shutting down the portal strands** temporarily. But **tampering** might also **advance the suspicion track** if detected!
