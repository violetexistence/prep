**Suspicion Threshold:**

- **Max Suspicion Points:** 6
- You determine when to advance the track (missed rolls, dragged-out play, repeated actions, or plot pacing needs).
## Stage 1 (0-1 Suspicion): Growing Unease  
- **Narrative Shift:** Guards begin **watching the PCs more closely**. Conversations linger, eyes follow them longer than before, but no alarms yet.
- **Mechanical Effect:** **All future Charisma (Deception) and Insight rolls increase by +2 DC.**
- **Example Fiction:** NPCs like Makubli (W2) or Maaltok (W5) might briefly halt the PCs mid-stride, asking them to confirm their orders.
## **Stage 2 (2 Suspicion): Lockdowns Initiated**
- **Narrative Shift:** Web’s Edge goes into **partial lockdown**. Maaltok and other cultists are on edge after recent intrusions elsewhere in the Underdark, so **W5 prison doors** are now actively monitored, and cultists begin **patrolling W1-W4.**
- **Mechanical Effect:**
	1. **Patrol groups** (2 drow mages + 1 giant spider) begin moving between areas every few minutes.
	2. PCs need **Stealth (DC 15)** to move between sections without getting spotted.
- **Example Fiction:** Cultists whisper that **Lolth’s gaze is upon them**—something feels wrong. A disguised PC is suddenly questioned by guards: “Where’s your escort? Aren’t you on the list?”

  

**Stage 3 (3 Suspicion): Countermeasures Activated**

  

• **Narrative Shift:** The high summoner Grottenelle (W3) casts **minor wards** at key doors, and **arcane locks** are engaged on sections like W9 (Fodder Chamber) and W10 (Barracks).

• **Mechanical Effect:**

1. **Arcane Lock spells** (DC 20 Dexterity check to bypass).

2. Certain NPCs are now **carrying keys**—forcing PCs to steal them (or confront guards directly).

3. **Skill Challenges** involving locked doors now require **multiple rolls** (one for bypassing the lock, another to avoid drawing attention).

• **Example Fiction:** A nearby cultist murmurs, “The last ones came through Blingdenstone, I’m sure of it.” The high summoner seals her door as the **lizard fodder room** becomes locked down—someone doesn’t trust the usual procedures anymore.

  

**Stage 4 (4 Suspicion): Time is Running Out**

  

• **Narrative Shift:** **Magical sensors activate**. Enchanted **glyphs** (like Alarm spells) now cover entrances into sensitive areas, including **W12 Sacred Web Hall**.

• **Mechanical Effect:**

1. PCs must **detect glyphs** with Arcana (DC 18) and **disarm them** (DC 15 Thieves’ Tools).

2. **Failure triggers loud alarms**, raising **suspicion by +1**.

3. **Patrols increase**, and NPCs will challenge anyone without **valid credentials or passwords.**

• **Example Fiction:** As a door slides open, the PCs catch sight of an **alarm glyph glowing faintly**. The clock is ticking—if they hesitate, more security could be on its way. NPCs stop briefly and whisper, “You there—who gave you clearance for this corridor?”

  

**Stage 5 (5 Suspicion): The Spider’s Eyes Are Everywhere**

  

• **Narrative Shift:** The **yochlol attendant Ylellith** from W12 grows suspicious. She sends **spies and minor demons** to watch over key rooms, and **guards block high-value areas** like the summoning chamber (W3) and Sacred Web Hall (W12).

• **Mechanical Effect:**

1. **Disguise checks** are now at **disadvantage**, as guards are actively probing for impostors.

2. **NPCs become hostile if given contradictory information.**

3. **Combat becomes more likely** as the cultists suspect treachery and attempt to interrogate the PCs.

• **Example Fiction:** “I _knew_ I’d seen that one before. They don’t belong here,” whispers a grimlock. The air is thick with tension—Ylellith has stationed **demonic observers** in every chamber. **Any misstep now risks combat.**

  

**Stage 6 (6 Suspicion): Heist Goes Loud**

  

• **Narrative Shift:** The cultists know something is wrong and **raise the alarm**. Ker-arach stirs from her web in W12, and **reinforcements from nearby areas flood in**. Time to fight or flee.

• **Mechanical Effect:**

1. **All cultists** are now **hostile**. They coordinate efforts to trap the PCs in the complex.

2. Each round after the alarm, **more reinforcements arrive** (up to 1d4 drow soldiers each time).

3. **Escape DCs increase by +5**, and **combat becomes deadly** if the PCs cannot extract the Rod fragment quickly.

• **Example Fiction:** Ker-arach’s massive form shifts in the distance, silk strands snapping as she awakens. Cultists converge on every entrance, snarling: “Seize them! Lolth demands blood!”

  

**Bonus Suspicion Track Uses: Ticking Clocks & Player Agency**

  

To keep the **suspicion track engaging**, here are a few ways you can make the system feel interactive and empowering for players:

  

1. **Player Choices Influence Suspicion Gain:**

• Offer **alternatives** when a roll is missed:

• “Do you succeed but push the suspicion track forward by 1 point?”

• “Or would you prefer to fail outright and figure out another solution?”

2. **“Partial Success” with Suspicion Consequences:**

• Allow for **success with complications**. For example:

• “You pick the lock, but it takes longer than expected. The next patrol will arrive soon—advance the track by 1.”

3. **Suspicion Threshold Clues:**

• Provide **small narrative signals** as the suspicion track rises. Maybe guards shift their tone, or an NPC warns: “You’d better hurry—everyone’s on edge today.” These moments give players **subtle feedback** about where they stand, increasing immersion.

4. **Player-Created Distractions to Lower Suspicion:**

• Allow creative players to **stage accidents or distractions** (e.g., **releasing the lizards** from W9) to **reduce suspicion by 1 stage**. This adds another layer of strategic decision-making.

  

**Closing Thoughts**

  

This **suspicion track system** turns the heist into a dynamic and evolving challenge.

With this track in place, you’ll have a **fluid, thrilling heist** where every roll feels meaningful, and even the smallest misstep could turn the mission from a quiet infiltration into a desperate escape.
