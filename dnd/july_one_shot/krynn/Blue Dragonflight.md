Of the battalions in Takhisis' [[Dragonarmies]] the Blue Dragonflight, commanded by Highlord [[Kyros]], is reputed to be the most strategically formidable. Their tactics are cold and calculated. They field the most variety of and best quality Soldier type units. They prefer limiting the options of their enemies and closing in around them like an inexorable vice.

The dragons of the Blue Dragonflight specialize in fast moving, all out assaults, preferring to overwhelm their enemies with speed and devastating attacks or else withdrawing before a defense can be organized.

At present, the Blue Dragonflight is working along with the [[Red Dragonflight]] to invade [[Sylvanesti]]. They advance from the west, currently camped outside the walls of the Lordcity [[Tarsis]].

[[Chalythrax]], the Oathkeeper.
