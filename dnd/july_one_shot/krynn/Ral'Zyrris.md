The Storm-Bound Tyrant

[[Blue Dragonflight]]

A titan of blue scales, darker than twilight, etched with scars that shimmer with static. Her wings are like thunderheads, vast and brooding, churning with barely restrained power. Her voice is the storm itself, a deep and patient thing, speaking in low rumbles that shake the bones. Age and wisdom temper her fury, but make no mistakeâ€”when she strikes, she devours worlds.
