*Lordcity of Tarsis, Tarsis the Beautiful*
# Mass Combat?
No. We're not breaking out the war game minis and moving battallions across the table to play out the story. Instead, we have a series of skirmish encounters with the player characters. 

- Aircraft Carrier Defense: Griffon Riders stage on the deck of the Lambent Zenith. The players defend the city from the air, fighting Blue Dragons and platoons of winged draconians.
- Inn of the Red Dragon: Waking up to the inn being attacked by the enemy. Players get to fight soldiers of the Blue Dragonflight and save townsfolk.
- Thunder's Roar: At the eastern gate, an unnatural thunderstorm descends on the city. This is of course the Blue Dragonflight as Highlord Kyros begins the attack. Players can man siege weapons, coordinate Tarsian forces to shore up the gate, or engage Kyros himself in an aerial duel.

## Disposition
The city of Tarsis is under siege. The defenders, led by Governor Rannick, have reinforced their defenses along the walls and battlements of the city. All non combatants have been evacuated to a secret shelter, unbeknownst to the enemy.

Two days ago, artillery from the Blue Dragonflight's 7th company began bombardment of the city. Highlord Kyros's strategy is to compel the city to surrender without the need for a direct assault. Without the walls to protect them, the Tarsian defenders are not expected to last even a single day. What few know is that the Highlord has a personal reason for trying to avoid an assault.

Bombardment has been ineffective. 

The city's walls are withstanding longer range siege weaponry, mainly trebuchet, quite well. This is not unexpected. What has been a surprise is that the 7th Company's shorter range, more devastating siege weaponry, has been unable to close to within effective range. Sorties being flown by griffon riders of the Skyclaw Pride are the reason. These aerial cavalry are able to dive in, quickly create enough casualties to cripple artillery crews, and withdraw before the Blue Dragonflight can respond.

A pair of dragons has been unleashed by the Highlord to fly into the city and find the griffons' base of operations and destroy it. This too has been unsuccessful. The griffons are launching from a Spelljammer anchored high above the city. *Lambent Zenith*, under the command of Captain Inda Malayuri, has been modified into a slower moving battle platform and armed to the teeth. It's key defensive capability is a home-brewed lightning shield which renders the breath of the Blue Dragonflight useless in any attack on the ship. A few of the griffon riders have been killed in these assaults not enough to reduce their effect on the theater of battle.

Any hope of avoiding battle is rapidly fading.
