*Lordcity of Tarsis, Tarsis the Beautiful*
# Mass Combat?
No. We're not breaking out the war game minis and moving battallions across the table to play out the story. Instead, we have a series of skirmish encounters with the player characters. 

- Aircraft Carrier Defense: Griffon Riders stage on the deck of the Lambent Zenith. The players defend the city from the air, fighting Blue Dragons and platoons of winged draconians.
- Inn of the Red Dragon: Waking up to the inn being attacked by the enemy. Players get to fight soldiers of the Blue Dragonflight and save townsfolk.
- Thunder's Roar: At the eastern gate, an unnatural thunderstorm descends on the city. This is of course the Blue Dragonflight as Highlord Kyros begins the attack. Players can man siege weapons, coordinate Tarsian forces to shore up the gate, or engage Kyros himself in an aerial duel.
