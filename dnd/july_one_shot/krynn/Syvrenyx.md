The Tempest-Touched

[[Blue Dragonflight]]

_Madness given wings._ His laughter **sparks the air**, erratic, jagged, electric. His **scales shift like a mirage,** rippling with the **chaos of the storm.** He **dances in the wind**, _rides_ the sky, exulting in the **pure, violent joy** of destruction. His voice **crackles**, shifting pitch with each word, like **a faulty circuit singing gleefully to itself.**
