The War-Hardened General  

Commander of the [[Tarsian Guard]], [[nobles|noble]] in name but a soldier by trade.

Stocky, battle-scarred, with a closely cropped beard and one missing eye.

**Blunt, pragmatic, and fiercely loyal to the city’s people.** He knows they cannot win a direct fight, but surrendering makes his blood boil. He searches for **any possible way to resist** without dooming the city entirely.

_“We may not be able to stop them now, but we must resist in any way we can. If we surrender completely, we sign our own death warrant.”_
