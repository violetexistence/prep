**House Cindreas** is an ancient noble house of [[Tarsis]], once renowned as the city’s premier martial aristocracy. Their bloodline traces back to the days when Tarsis ruled the Southern Ergoth as a dominant trade and military power, and they have never fully accepted their diminished role in the city’s politics. Known for their **cavalry traditions, battlefield honor, and unwavering pride**, the knights of House Cindreas still command a respected force of sworn swords, though their influence has waned under the rule of the merchant-led council. Led by [[Lord Caradoc Cindreas]] and his formidable daughter [[Lady Sylrienne]], the house remains committed to defending Tarsis—though whether that means following [[Lord Eddric Valcour’s]] strategy or seizing command of the fight for themselves remains to be seen.
