Sleek, sinuous, his movements like rolling mist, Zaethir is not the storm, but the warning before it. His voice is a hushed murmur, coaxing, twisting, a whisper of the wind through canyon walls. His eyes are cold, clever, watching with amusement, always watching. Lightning gathers in his maw, but it does not strike until he smiles.
