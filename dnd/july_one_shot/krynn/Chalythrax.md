The Oathkeeper

[[Blue Dragonflight]]

A colossus of iron will, his scales bear the burnished glow of lightning-glass, fused by centuries of battle. His horns curve like blades, serrated and jagged, thrumming with the charge of an eternal storm. He is order, discipline, unshaken purpose. He will hold the line. He will obey. He will never waver.
