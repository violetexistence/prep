The Shadowed Patron

A lesser [[nobles|noble]] with **deep ties to the Tarsian underground**, controlling black-market goods and information.

Pale, with piercing gray eyes and dark, voluminous robes that hint at her preference for the night.

**Calm, eerie, and always watching.** She knows more than she lets on and is always playing a **long game**. She might have **hidden knowledge about the [[Dragonarmies]]’ weaknesses**, but will only reveal it if it benefits her.

_“Not all battles are fought with swords. Some wars are won with whispers in the dark.”_
