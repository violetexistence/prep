The [[nobles|Noble]] Relic of a Bygone Age

A once-great noble house that has lost nearly everything.

Frail but regal, with trembling hands and a cane made of dragonbone.

**A relic of a lost time, still clinging to the ideals of nobility and honor.** 

He believes in **sacrificing for the greater good** but doesn’t see how that can be done now.

_“Honor is our only wealth now. If we sell that, we are nothing.”_
