The Idealist in Chains  

[[nobles|Noble]] merchant, formerly a patron of the arts and a lover of poetry.

Gaunt and tired-looking, with long black hair and a strained smile. Once a dashing noble, now haunted by the times.

**Once hopeful, now desperate.** 

He has **a wife and children still inside the city**, starving as the siege drags on. He sees only two choices: **feed his family by making peace or let them die for pride**.

_“I hate this as much as anyone, but what choice do we have? If this ends the suffering, we must take it.”_
