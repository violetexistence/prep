Khiiral'Kavon Tarmë are the Sylvanesti warriors and griffons and that fight as a company of mounted knights. Some ideas how to make aerial combat interesting:
- Spend half your speed of movement to mount a griffon. Spend downtime to get comfortable on griffon back and reduce this to 5 ft.
- Any time you are caught in a dragon's breath attack, roll to control your mount. Animal Handling (DC 10). Failure means your mount is *frightened* until the end of your next turn.
- Dive. Move at least 80 ft. and up to 160 ft. to attack an enemy below you. The Tarmë use this maneuver in groups to simultaneously attack a dragon and knock it out of the sky. It is risky, however, since moving at speed like this can end with both griffon and rider knocked unconscious or worse and plummeting to the ground.

Right now, the Tarme is laying low in the Lordcity of [[Tarsis]], assisting Alhana's recruitment effort.

## Mount Control & Manuevers

- Give them their wings / **Vorthil'taure** (vor-THEEL-tow-ray): This phrase signals a shift between direct control (controlled mount) and allowing the griffon to act with its own instincts (uncontrolled mount). An uncontrolled mount always acts directly after its rider in initiative. This command can be given at any time during the rider's turn as a free action as long as no other commands have been given.
- Hold the reigns / **Vorthil** (vor-THEEL): Opposite of Vorthil'taure. Signals the rider is in full control of the mount. Requires a successful DC 12 **animal handling** check and must be done at the beginning of the rider's turn.
- Bind the wind / **Shial'taure** (SHEE-ahl-tow-ray): When two or more griffins under direct control of their riders fly within 30 feet of each other, they can use formation flying manuevers. See [[Formation Flying|formation flying feats]].
- Skybound / **Eleran** (EH-leh-rahn): **Action**. Command to take off from the ground or begin an ascent. Your griffon mount gains +10 feet to their speed until the start of your next turn.
- Wind's Grace / **Silorin** (SEE-lohr-in): Command to let the griffon glide effortlessly, conserving stamina. Lose elevation. Your griffon mount restores 1D stamina at the end of your turn.
- Break Off / **Naevar** (NAY-var): **Action**, requires successful DC 15 **animal handling** check. Immediate disengagement order from a fight. Your griffon moves up to their speed without provoking opportunity attacks. Lose elevation.
- Strike True / **Thalamin** (THAH-lah-meen): Action. Both rider and griffon make attacks.
- Stormfall / **Hithalan** (HEETH-ah-lahn): Action. Requires elevation above target. Your griffon can move up to its speed. Both rider and griffon attack and have advantage on their first attack roll.
- Pierce the Sky / **Averis** (AH-veh-rees): Free Action, once per turn, requires stamina. Roll your griffon's stamina and gain elevation up to the result.
- Eagle's Bind / Torlithis (tor-LEE-thiss): Command to latch onto an enemy mid0flight using claws and beak. Your griffon makes an attack on an enemy within reach. On a hit, the enemy is grappled. Until the grapple is ended, both your griffon and it's target lose elevation. Target's can take an action to end the grapple with a successful strength (athletics) or dexterity (acrobatics) check
