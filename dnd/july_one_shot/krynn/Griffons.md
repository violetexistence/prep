Khiiral'Kavon Tarmë are the Sylvanesti warriors and griffons and that fight as a company of mounted knights. Some ideas how to make aerial combat interesting:
- Spend half your speed of movement to mount a griffon. Spend downtime to get comfortable on griffon back and reduce this to 5 ft.
- Any time you are caught in a dragon's breath attack, roll to control your mount. Animal Handling (DC 10). Failure means your mount is *frightened* until the end of your next turn.
- Dive. Move at least 80 ft. and up to 160 ft. to attack an enemy below you. The Tarmë use this maneuver in groups to simultaneously attack a dragon and knock it out of the sky. It is risky, however, since moving at speed like this can end with both griffon and rider knocked unconscious or worse and plummeting to the ground.

Right now, the Tarme is laying low in the Lordcity of [[Tarsis]], assisting Alhana's recruitment effort.
