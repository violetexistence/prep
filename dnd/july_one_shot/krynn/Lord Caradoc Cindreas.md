The Traditionalist

Lord of [[House Cindreas]], the eldest and most powerful [[nobles|noble]] in [[Tarsis]].

Heavyset, balding, with a well-groomed silver beard and deep-set, piercing blue eyes.

**Stubborn, conservative, and fiercely proud of Tarsis’s history.** 

He loathes the idea of surrender but sees no realistic alternative. He hopes to negotiate the **best possible terms** for his house, even if it means betraying some of his peers.

_“We must protect what little sovereignty we have left. If we must bend the knee, let us do so with dignity and bargain for our survival.”_
