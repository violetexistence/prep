The Power-Hungry Opportunist

Matriarch of [[House Morthas]], an ambitious [[nobles|noblewoman]] seeking greater power.

Regal, with dark auburn hair, sharp features, and a perpetual smirk. Always adorned in rich silks and jewelry.

**Cunning, ruthless, and calculating.** 

She sees [[Kyros]]’ arrival as a chance to **gain favor with the [[Dragonarmies]]** and position herself as the new ruler of [[Tarsis]] under their dominion. She is **willing to betray the city** if it secures her family’s future.

_“Why resist the inevitable? If we align with Highlord Kyros, we could rise higher than ever before!”_
