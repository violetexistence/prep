**The Silver Serpents of Tarsis**

House Morthas is one of the **wealthiest and most politically shrewd** noble families in [[Tarsis]], having long abandoned the knightly traditions of their ancestors in favor of **commerce, espionage, and manipulation.** While other noble houses cling to honor and battlefield glory, the Morthas **trade in influence, whispers, and well-placed bribes.**

Once a house of respected scholars and diplomats, their decline from grace began generations ago when they shifted their focus toward mercantile dominance and **controlling the city’s most lucrative industries—banking, trade, and high-end luxuries.** Now, they are **reviled by the old nobility** as scheming merchants, but they have **thrived in the new political landscape,** wielding coin and cunning where others use swords.

Under [[Lady Adrienne Morthas]], the house has reached **new heights of power,** but her ambitions extend beyond Tarsis. Seeing the writing on the wall, she views [[Kyros]] and the Dragonarmy not as conquerors, but as an opportunity. If she can broker a deal, **House Morthas will not just survive the invasion—it will emerge as the ruling force of a new Tarsian order.**

**House Motto:** _“Fortune Favors the Clever.”_

**House Crest:** A **silver serpent coiled around a merchant’s scale**, symbolizing both wealth and the careful balance of power they maintain.

**Holdings:** The Morthas **own vast warehouses, lending houses, and shipping contracts**, controlling much of Tarsis’s trade economy. They also **fund mercenary companies** to protect their interests when diplomacy fails.
