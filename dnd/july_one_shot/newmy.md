# Steps Known
***
***Ambient Arabesque.*** This dance creates an aura which extends the non-damaging effects of any spell currently affecting Newmy to all willing creatures of her choice while they re within 1- feet of her. The aura lasts until the start of her next turn, and never longer than the effect's stated duration.

***Bolstering Bolero.*** Newmy performs an enlivening spin, granting herself and each ally within 5 feet of her 7 temporary hit points.

***Holistic Impetus.*** Quickening a creature's natural healing, Newmy can lose 4 hit points to allow any creatures within 5 feet of her that can see her to use their reactions to spend and roll one of their hit dice. Any creature that spends a hit die regains an amount of hit points equal to the result of the roll plus their CON mod. If a creature's hit points are fully restored and any hit points remain, Newmy gains the remainder as temporary hit points.

***Sensational Sway.*** The performance of this inspirational dance acts as Newmy taking the Help action. Doing so allows Newmy to aid an ally in attacking a creature if the target of the attack is within 30 feet of Newmy while she moves and if the ally can see her.

***Succor Chasse.*** Newmy targets a creature within 30 feet that can see her. If the creature is under an effect that a successful saving throw can end, the creature can immediately attempt the saving throw to end the effect.

***Syllabus of Mimicry.*** Newmy opens herself up to suggestion through the somatic gestures of spells into a dance of mimicry, allowing her to bear the burden of their focus. If a willing creature within 60 feet of her performs the somatic components to cast a spell of 5th level or lower before the start of her next turn, she can use her reaction to maintain concentration on the spell instead of the caster.

***Tango Flame.*** Newmy chooses a creature within 15 feet of her. While the chosen creature is within 15 feet of her and either Newmy or the creature can see the other, they both have resistance to fire damage and each of their attacks deal an extra 1d4 fire damage on a hit. These benefits last until the start of Newmy's next turn.

***The Hustle.*** Newmy targets a creature within 30 feet that can see her. Until the start of her next turn, the creature gains an additional 10 feet of speed and it can use a bonus action on its turn to take the Dash action.

***Danse Macabre.*** Actually a number of dance steps, including the signature Zombie Walk, Arms Out Sequence, Shuffle and Claw Hands, Shoulder Shimmy, Hip Thrusts, and Head Snap. When performed, Newmy chooses a creature, a pile of bones, or a corpse. This step either raises it as an undead, skeletons from piles of bones or zombies from corpses, or dominates the targeted creature, compelling it to dance or perform actions at Newmy's command.

Raised dead only have a number of hit points equal to Newmy's level. She controls any raised as if by the animate dead spell for up to one minute or until Newmy stops dancing, after which they fall lifelessly. She can also dismiss any undead animated this was as an action.

Newmy can have up to a number of creatures dominated or undead animated equal to half her proficiency bonus, rounded up.
