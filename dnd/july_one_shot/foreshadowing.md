- **The Rose Symbolism**: Roses appear throughout the story—from the Sorrowsworn, to tomb murals, and finally tied to Nazoth’s manipulation. Perhaps the roses have a deeper meaning related to secrets and sacrifice—any time your players encounter roses, it’s a quiet reminder that they’re on Nazoth’s trail.

- **Mirrors and Reflections**: Mirrors could appear in unexpected ways—windows reflecting figures not there, water mirroring faces that seem off, or characters accidentally seeing things about themselves through a reflected object, hinting at shifts in identity or disguise.

- **A cryptic traveler** shares a proverb: _“Two roads never truly part—they circle like serpents.”_ This could hint that paths the party abandoned will come back to haunt them.

- **The Hag Laevis** tells Swish during one of their private conversations: _“Even the loudest lies become truths if whispered long enough.”_ This could hint at deeper manipulations involving the Waking Covenant and secrets yet to unravel.

- **Swish’s Dream**: She dreams of a thousand moons weeping blood into a river that flows backward, and she wakes with a craving for moonberries. This could foreshadow both the involvement of the moonberries in the kobold illness and the greater manipulations tied to forgotten deities.

- **Rory’s Vision in Sigil**: When looking through one of the enchanted windows, she sees not only Sigil but a far-off figure watching her—a vague suggestion that _Nazoth_’s influence touches even the outer planes. This can subtly signal that things are bigger than the PCs know.

- **Swish Notices Patterns**: When she looks too long at the stars or magical symbols, the same sequence of constellations or runes seems to repeat across different places. This pattern could foreshadow the presence of planar crossings or Nazoth’s manipulation in hidden details.

- **Rory’s Music Falters**: While Rory plays her lute in the tavern, the strings unexpectedly detune themselves mid-performance. Later, she finds that instruments in other places also seem to resonate strangely or become difficult to tune—an indication that reality is subtly unraveling.

- **The Bloodline Theme**: Early dialogue and side encounters reflect themes of inheritance and personal choices—NPCs are struggling with their legacies, secrets, or familial duties. This subtly echoes the deeper truth about the characters’ connection to the ancient empire and Nazoth’s influence over forgotten bloodlines.

- **Choice vs. Destiny**: Decisions made by the players—whether to spare a hellhound, ally with a hag, or recover artifacts—have small, seemingly disconnected payoffs early on. Yet later, they discover that _each choice reflected or strengthened a truth they didn’t yet know about themselves._

- **A Map on the Necklace Pearl**: Early on, Swish finds a pearl with a detailed map, but part of the design looks strange—almost as if it’s incomplete or rearranged. This later turns out to reflect how the Outlands will look when they encounter the “fractured reality” caused by Nazoth.

- **Artifacts with Hidden Secrets**: A seemingly ordinary object—like Numi’s bouquet—holds more significance when it keeps reappearing. Perhaps its flowers can survive anywhere, even the Shadowfell, suggesting that some magic (or curse) lingers around the players without their awareness.

- **Eldon’s Reluctance to Discuss Lambsensettle**: Eldon’s anxiety and half-truths about his involvement with Lambsensettle feel like a red flag. Later, these breadcrumbs could lead to a shocking revelation about his past involvement with the cult—or that he might have unintentionally aided Nazoth’s schemes.

- **Mayor Yara Rannit’s Growing Distrust**: During the first mission, Yara starts out as charming, but later, small actions—like cutting conversations short or avoiding eye contact—hint at something weighing on her. This could foreshadow her grappling with guilt or involvement in a larger scheme beyond the town’s politics.
