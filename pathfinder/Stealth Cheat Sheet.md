# Hide `[one-action]`

---

==secret==
**Skill** Stealth (Untrained)

---

You huddle behind cover or greater cover or deeper into concealment to become **hidden**, rather than **observed**. The GM rolls your Stealth check against the Perception DC of each creature you are observed by but that you have cover, greater cover, or are concealed from. You get a +2 circumstance bonus to your check if you have standard cover or +4 from greater cover.

<br/>

**Success** If the creature could see you, you're now **hidden** from it instead of **observed**. If you were **hidden** from or **undetected** by the creature, you retain that condition.

<br/><br/>

You become **observed** again if you cease to have cover, greater cover or concealment. You cease being **hidden** if you take any action other than **Hide**, **Sneak**, or **Step**. If you attempt to **Strike** a creature, the creature remains **off-guard** against that attack, and then you become **observed**. The GM might allow you to perform a particularly unobtrusive action without being noticed, possibly requiring another Stealth check.

<br/>

If a creature uses **Seek** to make you **observed** by it, you must successfully **Hide** to become **hidden** from it again.
