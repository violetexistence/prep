Cut to: an abandoned fishery in Old Korvosa.
Beneath a dock sagging with rot, a skiff rocks on tar-black water. A child stares from the shadows, lips cracked, arms wrapped around their knees. Someone shouts. The child doesn't flinch.

In the darkness, Gaedren Lamm sits hunched over a crate like a toad on a stone. His fingers-stained with bile and old chum-shuffle through a handful of low value coins and trinkets. A cracked monocle, a ribbon with initials, a brooch of tin and paint.

"No one gives a damn about a man like Gaedren," Callo mutters. "That's what makes him dangerous."

The skiff drifts closer. One of his little Lamms rows itin, eyes hollow. There's something heavy beneath the tarp. Something small. Something still.

"He doesn't take turf. He doesn't take names. He's only dealin in scraps. Leftovers left behind at the chophouse. Come right down to it, he's making messes disappear."

Smash cut to: A city orphanage with a caregiver dispensing "discipline" to a little kid's knuckles.

Smash cut to: A temple where kids are scrubbing floors and carrying huge bundles on their backs.

Smash cut to: A mercenary ship sailing into battle and beneath the cannon smoke little bodies piled on the deck broken like match sticks.

Callo looks at his pipe, empty again. He doesn't refill it this time. Just sets it down.

"Some say he used to work for someone big. That he got tossed out-too sloppy, too loud. Others say he used to be someone big. But I think he's just a kind of stink even sewers spit back out. Just wants to break things no one's watchin'."
