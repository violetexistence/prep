#### Walking the Stress of Korvosa
Korvosa is a city of stark contrasts—grandeur and squalor, order and corruption, loyalty and betrayal. Your character’s moral compass will shape how they navigate these streets and engage with the struggles ahead. _Curse of the Crimson Throne_ is a story about power, justice, and the weight of authority, but it is also about people—those who suffer under tyranny, those who enforce it, and those who seek to change it.

When crafting your character's **Edicts** and **Anathema**, consider these moral issues:
##### Standing Against Corruption
Korvosa’s descent into turmoil will challenge your character’s principles. The adventure assumes that, in some way, you oppose the city’s descent into tyranny, even if you don’t always agree on how to fix it.

- **Do you believe in justice, and if so, whose justice?** The law is not always fair, and fairness is not always lawful.
- **Are you a protector, an agitator, or an opportunist?** Some seek to shield the people, some to break the system, and some to survive within it.
- **How far are you willing to go?** You may have to make difficult choices—some that strain your morals, some that force you to redefine them.

Even if your character is self-serving or reluctant at first, they should have a reason to stay engaged with the events of the city. A lone wolf who refuses to work with others or an anarchist with no stake in Korvosa’s fate may struggle to fit into the campaign’s themes.
##### The Line Between Vigilante and Villain
Injustice breeds anger, and in a city like Korvosa, it’s easy to justify harsh measures against those who abuse their power. However, the campaign is not built for characters who revel in cruelty, destruction, or outright villainy.

- **Mercy or Might?** Will you seek redemption for the fallen, or is retribution the only answer?
- **Tyrants in Waiting?** Be wary of becoming what you fight against. Violence and power can be intoxicating.
- **Group Consent Matters.** If you wish to play a morally complex or ruthless character, talk with your fellow players to ensure everyone is comfortable with the tone and actions you plan to take. _Curse of the Crimson Throne_ is a story about fighting tyranny, not replacing it with your own.
##### Criminals, Scoundrels, and Rogues
Korvosa is a city of thieves, smugglers, and revolutionaries, and not every hero needs to be a knight in shining armor. A morally gray character can fit well, as long as they have a stake in the city’s fate and can work with the party.

- A thief who steals from the corrupt but protects the downtrodden? Perfect.
- A grifter who cons nobles but cares for the weak? Excellent.
- A remorseless murderer or chaos-driven saboteur? That might not fit.

If your character comes from a criminal background, consider their relationships with groups like the **Cerulean Society**, **House Arkona**, or Korvosa’s underworld. Are they looking to leave that life behind, or will their past come calling?
#### **A City Worth Saving**
Even in its darkest hours, Korvosa is not without hope. The campaign offers plenty of chances for acts of heroism, defiance, and sacrifice, no matter how your character defines them. Maybe you dream of a fairer city, or maybe you just want to protect the people who call it home. Either way, _Curse of the Crimson Throne_ is a story about change—whether through sword, spell, or speech.
