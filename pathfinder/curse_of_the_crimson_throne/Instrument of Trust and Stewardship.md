**I. Preamble and Invocation**

In accordance with the holy edicts of Asmodeus—First of Law, Flame of Binding, Patron of Order and Lord of Contracts—this Trust is enacted to ensure the fulfillment of rightful obligations, the protection of sacred authority, and the advancement of stable power through lineage and lawful succession.

The Beneficiary is to be supported until the age of majority through lawful structures, under vigilant oversight, with no deviation from the contract permissible except through formal adjudication before the Church or a duly appointed legal magistrate.

Let no soul claim ignorance of this agreement's power, for what is written is binding, and what is sealed is sacred.

**II. Scope of Trust and Original Intent**

The Trustor, by voluntary surrender of assets, herein establishes this fund for the exclusive benefit of the Beneficiary. This Trust serves to:

- Secure the Beneficiary's material welfare while preserving her right to lawful self-determination upon reaching adulthood.
- Establish the supremacy of legal custody over sentiment.
- Prevent unlawful appropriation by outside actors, including familial claimants, ecclesiastical overreach, or Crown exigency.

This trust may not be revoked, suspended, or challenged by any mortal court save with the consent of both the Church of Asmodeus and the Bank of Abadar in joint review.
