1. **King Eordred II's Birthday, 16 Calistril:** By royal dictate, the city marks the aging king's brithday with scantily clad dancers and free wine served to celebrants.
2. **Sable Company Founding Day, 6 Pharast:** A formal celebration marked by a parade and displays of martial prowess, this somber holiday is one of few that precludes alchohol.
3. **Breaking Festival, last Sunday of Desnus:** See the [[Breaching Festival]].
4. **Day of Destiny Festival, 3 Serenith:** Held to be the day Emperor Halleck IV signed the charter that eventually became Korvosa, celebrants of this holiday toast the city's health with cheap but abundant liquor.
5. **Riverwind Festival, 22 Sarenith:** At the start of summer, the prevailing winds shift for a few weeks, bringing a cool breeze down from the Mindpsin Mountains. This break from the heat is celebrated in the traditional way (i.e. drinking to excess).
6. **Founding Festival, 14 Erastus:** The wildest and festivities occur on the anniversary of the city's founding.
7. **Saint Alika's Birthday, 31 Arodus:** More a time of reflection than excuse to party, this small festival is celebrated with red and white flowers and platefuls of raw Alikan oysters.
8. **Crabfest, first Wealday of Rova:** As winter approaches, crabs that had migrated to the cooler water of the Jaggare River return to the bay. May end up as dinner at feasts.
9. **Great Fire Remembrance, 13 Neth:** Somber and quiet, this holiday shuts down the entire city. Most people stay at home and, by tradition, no one lights a fire from dawn on the 13th until sunrise on the 14th.
10. **Pseudodragon Festival, 7 Kuthona:** The last wild (alchohol fueled) celebration of the year occurs to mark the migration of wild psuedodragons from their warm weather homes in the Mindspin Mountains to their wintering habitats along the bay. The city's tame and domesticated pseudodragons take to the sky and greet their cousins, often spending most of the day frolicking above the city.
