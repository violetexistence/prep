You kneel at the eternal flame, fingers just above the brass ring where the heat is sharpest. The fire dances brighter for a moment, casting long, lashing shadows across the polished stone. Your eyes blur from smoke, the scent of cedar oil from the lanterns pull you hard, somewhere else—*back*.

The smoke curls into the outline of a boy, lean and little too tall for his frame, sitting cross-legged on the stone floor beside you. Vesh.

“I’m not meant for this place, Halya.”

You remember this. You *remember* this. But it’s not the version you’ve told yourself over the years. In the light of the sanctuary, here, you see it clearly, now.

“Mother thinks so too. She doesn’t say it, but she does.”

You see your younger self sitting beside him, so close, wishing it was closer. You hand on the stone inches away from his. Might as well have been miles.

“Too wild. Too loud. Too angry. Too *old*. Guess it’s time I stopped hiding here anyway.”

His voice breaks a little on that last part. The way he looked up into your eyes searching for an answer. There you are, unsure of what to say. It felt like silence was kindest.

What do you say to him now?
