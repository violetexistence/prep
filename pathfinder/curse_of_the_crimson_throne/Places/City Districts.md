Korvosa wears its Chelaxian bones like a badge—etched into every parapet, cobbled street, and red-tiled roof. Founded at the edge of the Empire’s reach, it claims to be the first human settlement in Varisia (though Kaer Maga would raise a rough hand in protest). From its perspective, Korvosa didn’t just survive the frontier—it brought law, order, and ledger paper. Everything else is either wilderness or waiting for its place in line.

The city spreads along the banks of the Jeggare River where it spills into Conqueror’s Bay. Its districts rise across two hills—Citadel Hill on the mainland, Garrison Hill on Endrin Isle—and spill outward into the river’s bends and across its far bank. The Narrows of Saint Alika divide Endrin Isle from the mainland, its tides churning beneath stone bridges and sharp eyes.

Korvosa is split into **seven official districts**, each with its own legacy of power, vice, or both. Most are subdivided into wards, but the names people use change depending on who’s listening.

## East Shore
On the far side of the Jeggare, East Shore is quiet and guarded. It’s home to noble families closely tied to the city’s military and the struggling arcane enclave of Theumanexus College. Folks here prefer uniforms and orders to petitions and protest.
## Gray
This is the dead district—literally. Gray houses Korvosa’s cemeteries, crypts, and the Grand Cathedral of Pharasma. Those who live here either serve the Lady of Graves or keep their heads low among the tombstones. It’s the only district in Korvosa where silence holds power.
## Heights
Perched atop Citadel Hill, the Heights is where the city’s elite build their walled gardens and gilded opinions. The monarchy, the oldest noble houses, and the most entrenched powers call it home. From here, they look down on the rest of Korvosa—in every sense of the word.
## Midland
If Korvosa has a polished face, it’s Midland. Here, coin flows, guards march, and streets bustle with commerce. The Korvosan Guard and Sable Company both call this district home, keeping crime low—but not absent. The thieves’ guild knows how to work a crowd, especially when merchants get comfortable.
## North Point
The city’s bureaucratic heart beats here. Home to the City Hall, the Bank of Abadar, and the Longacre Building (courthouse, prison, and general reminder not to step out of line), North Point is the oldest part of the mainland settlement. Many of Korvosa’s non-noble dynasties trace their roots to its wards.
## Old Korvosa
This is where it all began. Garrison Hill looms over Endrin Isle, crowned by Fort Korvosa and shadowed by Palace Arkona—a black-marble monument to wealth, power, and secrets. Old Korvosa is dense, raw, and unyielding, where nobles, criminals, and those too stubborn to leave scrape by side by side.
## South Shore
The city’s newest district, annexed just twenty-five years ago. Wide streets, fresh construction, and the sprawling Pantheon of Many define South Shore. Its residents are mostly nouveau riche and upward climbers—people who want to keep one foot in the city and the other far from its noise.
