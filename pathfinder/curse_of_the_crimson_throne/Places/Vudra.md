The Vudran people have a reputation for being consummate exaggerators and embellishers, a trait that would make them unbearable were it not for their constant good cheer and charisma. Beside the native Vudrani humans, Vudra is also home to Kelish peoples, aiuvarins, cambions (particularly faultspawn, spitespawn, and beastbrood), simian vanaras, ophidian vishkanyas, garudas, ratfolk, rhino-headed kashrishis, curse twisted ratajins, and rakshasas. Janni are often bound into service for Vudran nobles. The god-hating fiends known as asura are particularly common in Vudra, with its thousand gods the lands are rife with the religious ruins that asuras favor using for their lairs.

Numerous [[Askedhaki]] catfolk also roam Vudra, making a living as wandering traders. They often congregate in roving caravans; the warrios of these caravans take it upon themsleves to hunt down any creatures that prey upon the people of Vudra, including tigers and rakshasas, in particular. Unfortunately, due to their striped fur and fondness for expensive jewelery, the Askedhaki catfolk are sometimes mistaken for the tiger-headed raja-krodhas. To avoid this, Askedhaki will often incorporate religious symbols and blessed items into their outfits as these objects are anathema to any rakshasa.
