The flames rise and roar, the walls come peeling apart like leaves. 
You know what lies beyond it is agony. Unspeakable. Eternal. 
You are afraid. You step forward anyway. 

You smell the flowers woven into the wreath around your neck, sweet and wilting. 
Sacred oils on your skin. 
Mother's hand is warm in yours as she leads you into the ritual space. 
You want to help. 
You want to be good. 

You're strapped to a metal bed. 
Cold chains rattle. 
Mother turns the winch herself. 
You're lowered down—Into a chamber of silence and stone. 

One of the other Sisters tried to stop her. 
Not with force—with desperation. 
"This isn't right," she pleads. "She's just a child. The risk—this is reckless!" 
Mother cuts her off. "She's ready," she says. "This is the only way. We must reclaim our sight." 
When the Sister won't yield, Mother signals to the acolytes. 
They drag her out. Screaming. 

Then they bring in the crate. It's marked with a strange sigil—a great winged stag. 
Inside: a blue stone, softly glowing. 
They set it down beneath you. 
The air changes. 
You don't see the flame. But you _feel_ it. 
It licks at your soul. Hungry. 

And then the screaming starts. 
Your own voice shrill and ragged, torn from you by something older than pain. 
You scream as the memory and the moment collapse into one. 
You remember this. 
You are _remembering_ this. 
Because you _willed_ it. 

The fire wants to unmake you. 
Your body shakes. You convulse. 
Your lungs seize. You burn. 
And then—the chains rattle. 
They pull you up. 

"Did it work? someone whispers. 
Mother stares into your face. There is pity in her eyes. 
There is love, yes--but beneath it: _ambition_. 
Hope flickers. And dies. 

"She's been touched," Mother says slowly. 
"But it is not awake. We will wait. We will watch." 

"Perhaps we should just dispose of her," another suggests. "Try another..."
Mother turns sharply. "No. Don't you dare. She is mine to protect." 

She takes you in her arms. 
Tends your blistered skin. 
She sings a lullaby you don't remember. 
A lullaby you tried to forget. 
And part of you almost does. 

Maybe this was all a dream.
