Most residents of Korvosa, untrained in Religion, would not think of the Bank of Abadar at its faithful as separate things. They know the jink in their pocket, what’s left of it anyway, is minted there and that the head of that organization is **Archbanker Darb Tuttle**, or as he is more commonly referred to, the “Untouchable” or “Saint Interest”.

Heard at more than one public privy, in Old Korvosa, “Ahhh smell that? That’s good enough for a three pinch preacher, that is.”—it is often said that even Tuttle’s piss smells like coin.

If you are trained in religion you would know the particular edicts, etc.

# Abadar
## Master of the First Vault
---
**Areas of Concern** cities, law, merchants, wealth
**Edicts** bring civilization to the frontiers, earn wealth through hard work and trade, follow the rule of law
**Anathema** engage in banditry or piracy, steal, undermine a law-abiding court
**Holy Symbol** golden key
**Sacred Animal** monkey
**Sacred Colors** gold, silver

Abadar values dispassionate, impartial neutrality, and courts disparate divine allies as a mean sof learning all perspectives and using all available resources, whether or not he agrees with them. While most of his followers interpret his holy mandates by uplifting their communities and upholding law and order, his doctrine is easily twisted to objectivism and prosperity theology by those who wish to enrich themselves. He is also master of the First Vault, a divine trove that holds the perfect version of every type of creature and object.

Abadar is commonly represented as a handsome and statuesque man in ornate gold armor, draped in cloth embroidered with precious metals and holding law books, scales, or coins. Yet, his idolatry is wider still: Abadar can be seen in the perfectly honed blade, heard in the perfect song sung by a masterful bard, smelled in the perfectly cultivated rose no on dares to pick. Abadar exists in perfection, or at least a perpetual pursuit of it.
