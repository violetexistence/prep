# Korvosa in Anarchy
## Settlement 7
---
==City==

A once-proud city teeters on the brink of collapse--its throne cold, its guard overwhelmed, and its streets ruled by fire and fear.

**Government** power vacuum (nominal monarchy)

**Population** 15,250 (79% humans, 6% durhadan, 5% elves, 3% halflings, 2% gnomes, 6% other)

**Languages** Taldane (common), Shoanti, Varisian

**Religions** Abadar, Asmodeus, Pharasma, Sarenrae, Shelyn

**Threats** mob violence, looting, arson, vigilantes, suppressed divine aid, rogue magic

---

**Academae Learning** benefits are suspended for most people. The doors to the Academae are shut, access to its resources restricted to members, and students are given strict curfews.

**Survival Strain** Meeting basic needs in Korvosa is no longer a matter of course--it's a daily challenge. Each day a character spends in the city while this state persists, they either:
	- Suffer strain, advancing a condition or presenting your character with a difficult choice, at the GM's discretion.
	- Spend 1 Basic Needs Token. Acquire tokens by undertaking special subsist activities such as Secure Refuge, Engage in Looting, or others detailed in Surviving on the Edge of Anarchy.
