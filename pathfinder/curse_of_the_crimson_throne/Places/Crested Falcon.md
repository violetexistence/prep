From the street, the Crested Falcon gleams like a promise. Gaslight through frosted glass, the faint scent of truffle and saffron that never quite escapes the door. Inside, everything hums... silver, whispers, the soft panic of perfection. Servers move like clockwork dancers in white gloves., each step rehearsed, each word measured. The kitchen never sleeps.

No menu, not really. Each morning, someone in a starched apron chalks a list of what came in -- river crab, thileu bark, skyfruit if the ships made it through the squalls. Diners order from that list, trusting the kitchen to make something transcendant, or at least expensive enough to feel that way. Asking the price is like swearing in temple.

The bill arrives at the end, quiet and brutal. Some people laugh when they see it. Some don't. Those who can't pay find themselves drafted into service -- a charm laid on their tongue, a shimmer of compulsion that makes refusal impossible. Dish pit first. Then, if they're strong, the kitchen. If they're stronger, the hunt -- jigsaw sharks off the coast, pheasants in the hills, whatever the larder demands.

Out front, the nobles pretend it's all theater -- the spectacle of wealth, the romance of risk. Behind the curtain, knves flash, someone shouts, *Behind!*, a pan clatters. The head chef doesn't look up.

The Falcon isn't about food. It's about proof -- proof you belong in the room, poof you can pay the price without flinching. Those who can't learn what belonging costs.

Perched on Pillar Hill Boulevard between the warm light of the Temple of Sarenrae and the echoing stone of the Kendall Amphitheater, the Crested Falcon look like peace from the street. Wide glass windows. Brass fixtures polished until they hurt to look at. The smell of lemon oil and butter. Inside it’s anything but peaceful.

No menu—there never has been. Chef Hadrien Vourne, a distant cousin of House Vourne’s admiralty line, writes the day’s stock on a slate just after dawn: river crab, jigsaw shark, thileu bark, lamb from a Varisian caravan that came in late last night. The nobles call it /TODO:High Taldane for “trust dining”/ The staff call it “guesswork and prayer.”

Every plate that leaves the kitchen is a gamble, and every guest knows it. To ask the price before you ear is a social death sentence; to ask after is sometimes a literal one. The bills come sealed with a red wax falcon—a symbol of excellence, they say. For those who can’t pay, Javino Dorn the Falcon’s owner/operator, two-time candidate for Magistrate of Commerce, and long-time clerk of Asmodeus, makes an appearance, smiling and kind. The debtor leaves with a new compulsion charm around their neck. The kitchen doesn’t talk about what happens to them, but everyone’s seen the ones in the dish pit, or the sandwich board walkers on the hill.

Both Eodred (in his time) and Ileosa have been known to make an appearance, though, it is said the Queen never touches her food. She just watches, eyes like a dissecting scalpel, and leaves behind a single ruby large enough to cover the payroll for a month. Hadrien had the first one set into the wall above the pass and called it “The Sun.” No one has dares to touch it since.

Wealthy diners more interested in substance than style cross into North Point and dine at the Post and Turtle.
