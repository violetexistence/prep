#### Monarchy & Royal Administration
**Queen Ileosa Arabasti** (she/her, human) The Rose of Cheliax, with thorns down to the bone. Pretty? Sure. Popular? Not here. Folks say she married the old king for the crown, and now that she’s got it, she’s wearin’ it too tight. Watch her, and watch your mouth.  

**Neolandus Kalepopolis** (he/him, human) Seneschal—used to be the one who kept the King honest. Problem is, now he’s vanished. Took one look at Eodred’s corpse and ghosted harder than a Sable on shore leave. Some say he’s dead. Others say he’s hidin’. Me? I think he knew what was comin’ and got out before the blood started boilin’.

#### Peerage Review

**Lord Glorio Arkona** (he/him, human) _Silk on the outside, snakes on the inside._ Head of House Arkona. Richer than the whole Dockside. Throws parties, feeds the orphans, hands out perfume to gutter kids. All real sweet. But if you cross him or dig too deep, you end up floatin’ in the Jeggare with a smile carved into your face. Just stories, right? Sure. Just stories.

**Lady Vencarla Duvallis** (she/her, elf) _Talks like she’s teaching you manners, even when she’s stickin’ a knife in your gut._ She’s old peerage. Smart. Doesn’t shout, doesn’t boast. Just watches and waits. Rumor says she’s one of the few nobles what still remembers what humility tastes like. But who knows with elves. They’re good at waitin’ you out.

#### Law & Justice

**Arbiter Zenobia Zenderholm** (she/her, human) _“The Hanging Judge.”_ Cold as winter piss and twice as mean. She’ll string you up for blinkin’ wrong—but she won’t take a bribe, not even one o’ those pretty gem-studded kind. Don’t matter who you are. Rich, poor, noble, gutter rat—if you’re guilty, she’ll see the rope fits snug. Fair? Maybe. Merciful? Ha.

**Lictor Severs “The Chain” DiVri** (he/him, human) _Hellknight boss. Spends more time with devils than with people._ No one sees him smile. Or talk. Or blink. His knights do enough of all that—for a fee. Thinks law is the cure for sin and chaos. Maybe it is. But his law don’t care if you’re hungry, or desperate, or scared. It just punishes you for bein’ unlucky.

#### Military

**Field Marshal Kressida Kroft** (she/her, human) _She runs the Guard. Tries to keep ‘em honest._ It’s like tryin’ to carry soup in a net. Still, she’s one of the last left who ain’t forgot what justice is supposed to look like. Don’t mean she can enforce it with half her Watch too scared to walk South Shore alone.

**Commandant Marcus Endrin** (he/him, human) _Head of the Sable Company. Hippogriff riders._ Fancy types who still act like honor means somethin’. Endrin? Solid steel. Wouldn’t smile if you fed him plum wine and poetry. But he don’t bend, don’t take coin, and don’t kiss the Queen’s boots—least not yet.

#### Civil Governance

**Garrick Tann** (he/him, halfling) _Now there’s a pig dressed in velvet._ Magistrate o’ Commerce. He’s why your stall’s closed, your uncle’s fined, and your friend’s outta work. Lives by the Ledger, they say, but really he’s just got both hands deep in pockets that ain’t his. Hated more than lice in Sarenith. Still gets his tea imported from Cheliax. That says everything.

**Syl Gar** (they/them, gnome) _Best quant’ you’ll ever meet._ Runs the city’s purse strings, and somehow still finds coin for busted roofs and soup lines. Don’t know how they do it—maybe magic, maybe guts. Either way, folks love Syl. Which means they’re probably due for a knife in the back from someone what don’t.

#### Underworld

**Milia “Blue Lips” Gansari** (she/her, human) _Cerulean Society enforcer._ Milia’s got that nickname ’cause her lipstick never smudges—even after she’s broken your jaw. She’s polite, efficient, and terrifying in that way only someone backed by the law _and_ the thieves’ guild can be. Most folks think the Cerulean Society is just Korvosa’s mercenary union. They’re half right. Milia makes sure no one forgets the other half.

**Devargo Barvasi** (he/him, human) _The King of Spiders._ Runs Eel’s End like his own little kingdom of vice—cards, girls, drugs, blackmail, you name it. Keeps pet spiders in tanks like they’re friends. Real charmer, if you like your charm coiled and venomous. He’s got dirt on nobles, guards, and priests, and he’s smart enough to never use it all at once. You want something Korvosa won’t sell you? You find Devargo.

#### Temples & Schools

**Toff Ornelos** (he/him, human) _Headmaster of the Acadamae._ Sharpest robe in the city and colder than a frost wand in Abadius. Runs the Acadamae like a conjurer’s drill camp—strict rules, high walls, and a student body that either graduates with scars or not at all. Word is, even the Queen don’t order him around. He nods to the throne, but he kneels to no one.

**Bishop Keppira d’Bear** (she/her, durhadan) _Keeper of the Grand Cathedral of Pharasma._ Wears a face like a tomb door: cold, solid, final. Speaks quiet, walks quieter, and watches everything. Runs the Gray District like it’s a chapel and battlefront all rolled into one. You get a proper burial in this city, you thank Keppira. You don’t? You probably made an enemy.  

**Archbanker Darb Tuttle** (he/him, elf) _High priest of Abadar._ Looks like a marble statue someone dared to breathe life into—cheekbones sharp enough to slice parchment, robes folded like origami, not a hair out of place in a hundred years. Everything about him is precision, beauty, and cost. Tuttle doesn’t walk, he glides. Doesn’t speak, he declares. Ask him for a loan and he’ll smile like he’s already decided how many lifetimes you’ll spend paying it off.

**Sister Beryndr’n** (she/her, human) _Sarenite Mother of the Dawn._ Don’t let the soft voice and warm hands fool you—she’s weathered more fire than she preaches about. Keeps the Sarenite flock together with grace, grit, and a few well-placed secrets. To the faithful, she’s a lantern in the dark. To the crown? A problem too delicate to crush without scandal. Some say she knows more about prophecy than she lets on. Me? I think she’s already seen how all this ends—and it scares her.
