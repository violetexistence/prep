The Shingles weren’t planned. They crept upward.  

When Old Korvosa’s poorest were displaced from Endrin Isle during a wave of “urban renewal,” they crowded into Bridgefront—until Bridgefront couldn’t hold them. So they built upward: lean-tos balanced atop aging tenements, tarpaulin roofs stretched across chimneys, stairwells added without permits or plans. Rotted joists gave way to reinforced timber, and rooftop shanties turned into stacked warrens five stories high. From this patchwork scaffold, the Shingles were born.

They spread like ivy, reaching into the tightest wards of the city—Bridgefront, Old Dock, West Docks, parts of Pillar Hill and even Garrison Hill where the slope allows. Ramshackle ladders, swinging gangplanks, and planked crawlways connect buildings by air, forming a hidden layer of passage and shelter above the streets. The roofs became roads. The roads became homes.

No map of the Shingles stays true for long. Routes shift when a walkway collapses, or a new hideout is hammered into place. Locals and rooftop runners call it “shingle-dashing,” and treat navigation as part instinct, part memory, and part dare. Whole families live above the rain gutters, some never touching street level. Others use the height for commerce—or for crime.

And it’s not just people up there.

Imps loose from the Acadamae’s circles nest in gutter-boxes. Stirges suck blood from cats and children alike. Shingle spiders—leggy things the size of hounds—creep between rafters. The worst are the chokers. Parents in Old Korvosa still whisper warnings to restless kids: _Don’t climb too high, or the roof-hands will take you._

They’re not always wrong.
