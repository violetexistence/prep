This boutique is seamlessly constructed from polished white stone, with nearly every inch covered in sprawling lifelike reliefs of blossoming ivy, berry-laden branches, and small animals such as songbirds, foxes, and hares. The shop‚Äôs interior, which smells brightly of fresh fir tips and petrichor, is a marriage between opulence and austerity. Marble floors the color of freshly fallen snow and plaster bas-reliefs depicting birch trees frame arched entryways and extend upwards, supporting the vaulted ceilings.
## Spring Blooms
Iltara Clavela (she/her human witch) is a mysterious woman who speaks with a subtle, lilting accent, belying her Irisseni upbringing. Silver curls frame high cheekbones and a sharp chin, while deep smile lines crease the corners of warm, bright blue eyes. Her words are always carefully chosen‚Äîconcise and meaningful, just like the bespoke fashions and accessories that pervade her personal wardrobe and exclusive boutique. Despite a bright and welcoming demeanor, she has little patience for foolishness, and her mood can turn tempestuous when she feels deceived or put-upon.

Mistress Clavela rarely speaks of her past but has been known to reminisce wistfully of another life in the lands gripped by endless winter. She tells the story of a twilight child born in the wintry courts of the Jadwiga. A child once blessed and twice cursed, for her parents had courted the favor of a winter fey, both ancient and cruel, to fulfill their deepest wish‚Äîa son endowed with fey magic, who would wield every transmutation of storm and frost as effortlessly as he drew breath. Among the nobility, hushed whispers alluded to the young man‚Äôs terrifying power. Meanwhile, his parents proliferated the belief that he would one day lead their armies in a second Winter War.

But the winter fey had made a stark omission, for the moment it met the child‚Äôs gaze, it learned two truths: that she bore a feminine spirit and that she would never command an army. She voiced these truths on countless occasions, begging her parents to let her abdicate her name and search for the magic that would align her form to her spirit. When they eventually enlisted her, she fled in secret to the deepest Feyfrost where even they dare not follow. There she searched for the winter fey to strike a bargain of her own. No magic in all of Irissen could align her form to her spirit, the creature claimed, so she asked only for it to help her escape so she might seek such magic elsewhere. The price she paid seemed trivial, the very name she yearned to relinquish, and she soon chose a new one while basking under her first summer sun in the Lands of the Linnorn Kings. She would be Iltara, and she would never pretend to be anyone else again.

Iltara survived for some time by utilizing her skills as a manuscript scribe, needleworker, and midwife, but never her magic, for she dared not reveal herself as a winter witch. A day came when she mended the well-worn and brightly colored costumes of a troupe of Varisian entertainers in exchange for supper. They took pity on the gangly and ravenous teen and invited her on as their seamstress. Over time her stitching gained confidence, and she quickly graduated to tailoring and styling.

Far from the frigid north, Iltara divulged her fey gifts to her companions and, to her satisfaction, struck her second bargain‚Äîshe would perform magic as ‚ÄúMistress Clavela‚Äù in exchange for their help accumulating arcana. She pored over every new spell, fixated on combining their principles in increasingly unconventional ways. Her companions dismissed her obsession until the day she emerged, proudly flaunting an enhanced visage that bore no lingering magic. Little by little, she affirmed herself in every detail of her body until it became apparent that she‚Äôd found her true calling. From the moment she advertised her new services, her name circulated the nobility once more. Gold poured in, as well as droves of would'-be partners and assistants, and she soon afforded her first carriage on her way to founding Absalom‚Äôs own Material Changes.
## A New Look
Most customers arrive by appointment, but every visitor is greeted by a smiling attendant who happily tends to their needs. Browsers and voyeurs are not unwelcome but are met by a sea of knowing looks and winks. After all, a familiar adage among the staff is that no one arrived by accident. While countless businesses cater to the fashion needs of Absalom‚Äôs elite, Material Changes caters almost exclusively to those seeking a more complete transformation.

Equal parts clothing boutique, beauty salon, and day spa, Material Changes employs a staff of master artisans and arcane practitioners. Some specialize in bespoke items and alterations‚Äîtestimonials substantiate their ability to alter even magical garments without compromising their properties‚Äîwhile others apply proprietary methods of combining transmutation and illusion magic to rejuvenate their clients‚Äô bodies and spirits. For many, this means prolonging their youthful vigor, enhancing their natural beauty, or unwinding beneath an arrangement of sensory illusions. For others, it can mean a physical transformation so complete that afterward they are unrecognizable to even their closest friends. Such a process can be gradual, requiring multiple appointments, and some choose to purchase a premium package that includes lodging in the boutique‚Äôs private loft for the duration.
## What‚Äôs the Secret?
Rumors abound about the boutique and its mysterious proprietor. Many can‚Äôt help but compare Material Changes‚Äô transformations to fleshwarping and some even go so far as to accuse Mistress Clavela of stealing her magic from the fleshforges of Nex. Mistress Clavela is quick to dismiss these accusations, but in truth, she has no shortage of rivals who might seek to defame her to obtain her proprietary arcane secrets. Likewise, she would be loath to admit it, but she‚Äôd like nothing more than to learn the source of these rumors so that she can quell them once and for all.

The boutique‚Äôs ability to drastically change a client‚Äôs appearance has also attracted attention from the Absalom watch, who often confront the employees with veiled insinuations that Mistress Clavela uses her magic to help criminals avoid the law. While there‚Äôs never been such an incident among her past customer base, it hasn‚Äôt stopped visits from suspicious watch members. Mistress Clavela is considering if she can pull any political strings to prevent the obnoxious agents from troubling her any further.

While the extravagant prices the boutique commands cover most of its expenses, it still requires a steady supply of magical reagents. If one is looking to sell magical curiosities or components acquired from rare beasts, a senior staff member would assuredly be willing to examine them to assess their sell value. However, Mistress Clavela‚Äôs primary personal interest is in broadening her magical expertise. Those close to her attest that she even seeks secret knowledge of forgotten scrolls and tomes, which she might be willing to share with proven adventurers who would brave untold dangers and collect them for her.

# **üåø Spring Blooms**
This boutique is seamlessly constructed from polished white stone, with nearly every inch covered in sprawling lifelike reliefs of blossoming ivy, berry-laden branches, and small animals such as songbirds, foxes, and hares. Inside, the air smells brightly of fresh fir tips and petrichor, and the design is a marriage between opulence and austerity: marble floors the color of freshly fallen snow stretch between arched entryways framed by plaster bas-reliefs of birch trees, all soaring upward to support vaulted ceilings.
## **üå∏ Mistress Iltara Clavela**
_(She/Her ‚Äî Human Witch)_  

Iltara Clavela is a striking woman whose subtle, lilting accent belies her Irisseni heritage. Silver curls frame high cheekbones and a sharp chin, while deep smile lines crease the corners of her warm, bright blue eyes. Her words are always carefully chosen‚Äîconcise and meaningful, just like the bespoke fashions and accessories she curates in her exclusive Korvosan boutique. Though welcoming, she has little patience for foolishness, and her mood can turn tempestuous when she feels deceived or put upon.

Mistress Clavela rarely speaks of her past, though on rare occasions she reminisces about another life in the frozen lands of Irrisen. She tells the story of a twilight child born to the Jadwiga nobility‚Äîa child once blessed and twice cursed. Her parents courted the favor of an ancient, cruel winter fey to conceive a son destined to master the storms and frosts of their lineage. Among the nobility, whispers spoke of the child‚Äôs terrifying power. Her parents boasted that he would one day lead an army in a second Winter War.

But the winter fey had omitted a cruel truth: the child bore a feminine spirit, and would never command an army. Time and again she begged her parents to let her abandon the life they envisioned for her and seek a magic that could align her form with her spirit. When they instead sought to bind her into service, she fled deep into the Feyfrost. There she bargained for escape, offering her given name in exchange for the chance to seek her own fate. She chose a new name‚Äî_Iltara_‚Äîwhile basking under her first summer sun in the Linnorm Kingdoms.

Iltara survived as a scribe, needleworker, and midwife, careful never to reveal her wintry magic. One day, destitute, she repaired the costumes of a Varisian troupe in exchange for supper. Pitying her, they offered her a place among them as a seamstress. Over time, her confidence grew; she turned to tailoring and eventually revealed her talents in magic. She struck a second bargain: to perform her magic openly as ‚ÄúMistress Clavela‚Äù in exchange for access to rare and hidden lore. Obsessed with blending spellcraft and craftsmanship, she eventually achieved the miraculous‚Äîreshaping herself, body and soul, without lingering magical traces.

Her fame grew among the nobility, gold followed, and, after many years, she found herself in Korvosa, where she opened _Spring Blooms_ in the heart of North Point. Today, Mistress Clavela is a sought-after figure among Korvosa‚Äôs elite‚Äînot only for her impeccable fashions, but for services far rarer and more discreet.
## **üåº A New Look**  

While Spring Blooms welcomes browsing clients, most visitors arrive by appointment. Every guest is greeted by a smiling attendant who offers personal attention‚Äîand, subtly, scrutiny. A saying among the staff holds that _‚Äúno one arrives by accident.‚Äù_ While Korvosa boasts many clothiers for the wealthy, **Spring Blooms** caters to those seeking **true transformation**.

Equal parts boutique, salon, and arcane workshop, Spring Blooms employs master artisans and spellcrafters. Some specialize in altering magical garments without disturbing their enchantments; others weave rejuvenating illusions and subtle transmutations. Most clients seek minor enhancements‚Äîpreserving beauty, restoring vitality‚Äîbut a rare few seek **complete transformation**, requiring longer stays in the boutique‚Äôs secluded loft suites.
## **üåô What‚Äôs the Secret?**

Whispers about Mistress Clavela and her boutique circulate constantly:
- Some liken her magic to forbidden **fleshwarping**‚Äîthough such accusations are dangerous and unproven.
- Others hint that she once plundered forgotten magic from the ruins of ancient Nex.
- Still others claim that criminal elements use her services to _change their identities_ and evade Korvosan justice.

Though the Korvosan Guard has investigated discreetly, no wrongdoing has ever been proven. Still, persistent attention from officials has left Iltara quietly seeking political patrons who might shield her from unwanted scrutiny.

While her exorbitant fees sustain the boutique, Spring Blooms also maintains a steady appetite for **rare magical reagents** and **esoteric arcana**. Adventurers bearing unusual magical curiosities‚Äîor willing to retrieve forbidden tomes from dangerous locales‚Äîmight find willing buyers among the boutique‚Äôs senior staff. And those who prove truly trustworthy might earn access to Iltara‚Äôs _hidden library of transformative magic_, knowledge she shares only with a precious few.
