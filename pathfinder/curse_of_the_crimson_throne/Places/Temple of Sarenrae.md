## The Church
The church of Sarenrae does not have a strict hierarchy, instead acting in a more familial style. Members are encouraged to go where they are called, for wherever folk gather, there are ills to cure, wrongs to right, and darkness to vanquish.

The worship of Sarenrae spread gradually across the Keleshite trade routes, and while she is worshipped far and wide now, the greatest concentration of temples and churches can still be found along those avenues. Her temples are vast, open affairs. The Qadiran influence is easily seen in the wide, brightly colored tiles courtyards and rounded domes that stretch sunward. The central area features painstakingly shines brass and copper accents, sometimes with mirrors or other devices to direct beams of sunlight toward a central altar, from which the priest holds services. Messages are not of fire and vitriol, but of redemption, peace, and the uplifting of those more in need than yourself.

The side buildings are the only buildings of these complexes that are roofed, and these are the places where the goddess's charity is most keenly felt. Hospitals for the sick and injured, good banks for the hungry, or temporary living for the destitute are common sights at any temple or church able to support such endeavors. Services are loud, boisterous affairs, with much giving of thanks. Music and dancing are common, as are good natured contests of strength, reenacting the titanic struggle where Rovagug the Rough Beast was ensconced in the Dead Vault for the good of all creation.

Each member of the church is told to carry a copy of The Birth of Light and Truth, the collection of stories and poems that tell the story of Sarenrae before she was raised to be a deity, to help spread the word of Sarenrae and uplift those in need, or redeem a soul lost to evil. Each book is hand-copied by the faithful, so that each story is slightly different in the telling, and thus perhaps more likely to appeal to a wide variety of people as opposed to the rigidly prepared strictures of other gods. Customarily, new sheafs will be added to back of the book for the faithful to copy the uplifting stories from their own lives, lending an air of deep personal connection to every copy. As such, no two are ever the same.
### Korvosa
The Temple of Sarenrae in Korvosa is a notable departure from the traditional open, sun-drenched temples commonly found along the Keleshite trade routes. While most Sarenite temples feature wide courtyards, vibrant tilework, and radiant domes that flood sacred spaces with sunlight, Korvosa’s temple takes on a more fortified, enclosed design—a blend of Qadiran spiritual design and Chelaxian colonial practicality.

This temple was constructed atop the remnants of an older Chelish fort, and that legacy still shows. Stone walls, fortified gates, and narrow towers give the building a fortress-like profile—a reflection of Korvosa’s more rigid, hierarchical society and the city’s need to project strength and stability. The architecture adapts Sarenite aesthetics where it can, but the layout prioritizes defensibility and resource control over open access.
### Holidays
The entire month of Sarenith is named in honor of Sarenrae and is home to several important holidays.

The **Burning Blades** ceremony held on the 10th of Sarenith, is the culmination of a month-long festival honoring Sarenrae. Adherents perform in ceremonial mock combat with weapons lit aflame. More dance than battle, it is a vibrant affair.

The **Sunwrought Festival**, held annually on the solstice, is an exuberant celebration, complete with dancing, feasting, and the trading of homemade goods of the finest qualities.
### Aphorisms
**The dawn brings new light:** a catch-all phrase meant to both bestow good blessings upon someone during a momentous occasion, or conversely, to lift the spirits of someone for whom the shadow of sadness or despair has fallen.

**Both the sun and rain are needed to grow:** While the sun is often the primary focus of those familiar with Sarenrae worship, the wisest among them recognize that adversity and struggle help make the light shine ever brighter.

**I call the light:** Used as a battle cry of the faithful to call the attention of Sarenrae to the struggle at hand, shouted toward the Heavens when battle is first joined, simultaneously asking for protection and luck in the fight ahead.
