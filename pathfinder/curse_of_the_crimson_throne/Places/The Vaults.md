Most cities build up. Korvosa builds down.

Beneath its streets lies a tangled, breathing underworld known as **the Vaults**—a warped confluence of burial grounds, sea-caves, sewers, and ruinous crawlways inherited from civilizations long buried beneath the city’s marble and blood. There are older cities beneath Korvosa, and older stories still, pressed down like layers of damp parchment. When the city sleeps, the Vaults remember.

No single map exists of the Vaults. Too many forks that go nowhere, too many tunnels that lead back to themselves, too many places that ought not be found again.

**Shoanti Burial Trenches**

Before the Chelaxians ever set foot here, the Shoanti kept their dead in squared earthen trenches capped with stone and mounded earth. These burial ditches still honeycomb the ground beneath Garrison Hill and Citadel Hill, carved to honor warriors, kings, and fire-speakers.

When the colonists came, they saw not sanctity, but opportunity. Chelish engineers and Janderhoff miners linked the trenches together, turning ancestral tombs into public sewers. The bones remain beneath the city, drowned in runoff and rot. The waste flows past the dead, and sometimes the dead stir.

**Natural Caves**

Erosion, time, and something older than either shaped the deepest parts of the Vaults. These are not halls made by hand, but shadowy mouths and veins in the rock, some plunging well below the bay’s tide line.

Some are sea-caves—slippery, brackish, and prone to collapse. Others open into sinkholes or steep-walled cysts formed when half a cliff’s weight suddenly drops away. The most infamous of these yawns beneath **Palace Arkona**, a sheer black pit the Arkonas say is sealed. But the stink of salt and something worse sometimes wafts up from its base.

A few believe the Vaults connect to a greater dark beneath the world—tunnels too old and too deep to chart. Occasionally, something comes crawling out to remind Korvosa that the past is not always dead.

**The Worked Tunnels**

There are other paths beneath Korvosa. Narrow halls lined in forgotten stone. Chambers cut with precise, inhuman geometry. Some run beneath **the Pantheon of Many**, their origins unknown. Others go on for hundreds of feet and simply stop—ended by cave-ins, ritual seals, or sudden silence.

No one knows who carved them. The dwarves deny it. The elves remain pointedly quiet. The Vaults, as ever, keep their own counsel.
