Pelden adjusts the central disk of the astrolabe with a flick of his ink-stained fingers. Its rings settle into place with a satisfying tick, catching the light from the brazier nearby.

“Ah. The Lantern Bearer enters eclipse,” he murmurs, not looking up. “She wanes through the eighth arc of Kharastil’s spiral. That gives us… thirteen hours and a span, by the Sarenite reckoning. That’s when the angle turns. A hinge hour. Not a promise, mind you—just a door that opens more willingly than others.”

He consults a folded page of calculations, each line scrawled in cramped script with corrections and circled glyphs. “It’s the kind of window old astrologers call a valenthra—a lean moment. Not fortune, not fate. Just the sort of time where even slow hands strike truer.”

He turns the chart toward you, a spray of tiny constellations inked in red and gold. “The stars don’t speak plainly, of course. They never do. But this pattern is tight. Local. No great storms in it. Just something small. Sharp.”

He finally looks up, brushing a lock of silver hair behind one ear. “If you’re to act, do so thirteen hours past the Lantern’s dimming. That’s when threads slip loose.”

He closes the chart and offers a slow nod. “And if the moment passes unheeded, well… another will come. But not so cleanly. Not so quiet.”

Then, with a familiar gleam in his eye, he leans back against the brass stand. “Now then. I have a jug of candied mulberry spirit from Katheer, and an annotated copy of The Sky Lies Twice if you fancy reading errors in 300-year-old starwork. But I warn you—it has opinions.”
