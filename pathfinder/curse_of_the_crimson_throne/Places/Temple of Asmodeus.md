Thirty years ago, the Church of Asmodeus in Korvosa consisted of little more than a dilapidated temple—a holdover from the post-war reconstruction era. It stood not as a center of worship, but as a symbol: a performance piece, staged to entice the motherland into accepting its wayward colony back into the fold. But in truth, the edicts of Asmodeus have never required a temple to exert influence over Korvosa.

Power lies elsewhere.  

**The Ledger**—Korvosa’s city hall—has long served as the true seat of Asmodean authority. Home to hundreds of magistrates and civil functionaries, it governs the city not through prayer but through process. For much of Korvosa’s history, these magistrates were also ordained clerics of Asmodeus, drawing divine sanction to enforce secular law. Even now, every official entering public office swears their oath upon the red pentagram, in accordance with Chelish tradition. In Korvosa, as in Cheliax, **bureaucracy is divine order made manifest.**  

Everyone in Korvosa has heard the story of the temple’s re-consecration. Some even remember it.  

It is said that when the grand new chapterhouse of Asmodeus was finally dedicated in the Heights, **Archbishop Reebs** led the rite alongside the Headmaster of the Acadamae. The ceremony, according to witnesses, featured a summoned and bound erinyes, and thirteen willing sacrifices—all young, all pure of heart, all claimed by the church to have consented.  

But most believe otherwise.  

Rumors swirl to this day: that charms and compulsions were used, that oaths were twisted to feign consent. Whatever the truth, the reaction was immediate. The city teetered on the edge of open revolt. Citizens called for the razing of the temple, the dissolution of the church’s charter, even the dethronement of the monarchy.  

It was **Queen Domina** who restored order. Using her personal treasury, she commissioned a high-ranking resurrectionist from far beyond Cheliax, tasking them with returning the thirteen to life. Of those, **four refused the offer**, their souls unwilling to return. The remaining nine rose again and, to this day, live as minor celebrities—**symbols of survival and scandal**, kept as wards of the crown under light protection and constant attention.

Asmodeus is revered not merely as a deity, but as the **source of divine law**—the first to set order upon the chaos of existence. According to Asmodean doctrine, he and his brother Ilhys shaped the mortal world from primal formlessness. Ilhys, compassionate but naïve, sought to gift mortals free will. Asmodeus, foreseeing the suffering that such liberty would cause, chose a different path: _to bind creation in law_. He struck Ilhys down—not in rage, but in grim necessity.  

Where other faiths call this murder, Asmodean clergy call it **sacrifice**: the birth of the First Pact, where freedom was tempered by consequence, and choice became weighed with accountability.  

Critics label this doctrine a myth crafted to justify tyranny, but Asmodean theologians argue that **without structure, mortal civilization collapses into ruin**. Laws—however harsh—preserve peace. Hierarchy ensures function. Contracts protect the weak by giving them terms, and punish the strong if they violate them.

Asmodeus is most often portrayed as a resplendent judge or lord, draped in crimson and shadow, bearing a scroll of law sealed in flame. His throne is ringed by the **machinery of divine law**—gears turning, chains binding, quills writing. His charisma is legendary; his wrath, exacting and cold.  

His temples serve as **courthouses, contract halls, and centers of civic power**. Acolytes act as magistrates, negotiators, and enforcers. Worshippers include judges, diplomats, bureaucrats, high-ranking military officers, and rulers who see his teachings as a framework for maintaining empire.
