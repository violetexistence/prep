aka *“Crimson Phage”* is an exceedingly rare disease and has only been reported in southwestern Varisia, specifically in and around the Lost Coast. It is known to only be passed by contact with contaminated body fluids such as saliva or open wounds. The onset of symptoms is incredibly quick, generally within a single day, and can include painful and disfiguring facial tumors, and a slow sloughing off of the dermis over the entire body, leaving only exposed bloody flesh—hence the nickname. Eventually fatal if left untreated, the painful disfigurement often causes the victim to go insane before dying.

The journals within the temple of Sarenrae would also know a bit of the interesting backstory to this affliction. It is connected with a failed attempt at achieving lichdom, In 4644 AR, the wizard Vorel Foxglove was interrupted by his wife Kasanda in the final stages of the necromantic rituals needed to become a lich. The magical backlash consumed his body within seconds, killing Vorel and creating Vorel’s phage in the process. The disease also killed Kasanda, their children, and all the servants of Foxglove manor, but did not spread further.

Over forty years later, Vorel’s great-nephew, Traver Foxglove, bought the decaying manor home in 4676. He soon became infected with the phage, but with him, as with all members of the Foxglove family, the disease only affected his mind. Slowly driven insane, he eventually killed his wife as she was attempting to burn down the house, dying by suicide thereafter. His children, among them his son Aldern, were saved and given to family members to be raised.

Recall Knowledge (Medicine) at the home of Tayce Soldado revealed that Brienna’s symptoms were similar to Crimson Phage. However, there are differences. There are no signs of permanent tumors or disfigurement. Neither was there any cognitive disorder that you observed, although Brienna was blessedly unconscious most of the time. This suggests you may be looking at a variant strain. Or, potentially a different albeit similar affliction entirely. Further investigation is required if you hope to know for sure.
