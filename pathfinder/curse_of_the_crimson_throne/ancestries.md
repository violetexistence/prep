# Dwarf
**Durhadan (*DOOR-hah-dahn*):**. Though not numerous, the stonebound hold a quiet but enduring place in Korvosa’s bones—literally. From sewer gates to noble vaults, their craftsmanship supports the city even when its politics fail. Many belong to old trade houses from Janderhoff, managing contracts for stone, metal, and enchanted gear. But younger Durhadan born in Korvosa are starting to push beyond tradition—tinkering with aetheric machines, joining civic reform efforts, or founding their own cooperatives in the Dock Trade and Midland. Whether you’re a stonebound traditionalist or a forge-sparked innovator, Durhadan in Korvosa shape the city with every strike of hammer and ink.
- **Tharik Ironward**, a name carved into contracts older than your grandparents.
- **Murna Coalbraid**, a voice that carries across a rally on the steps of The Ledger.
- **Vengra Sparkhelm**, the soot-smudged partner arguing voltage ratios with gnomes on Flowerglass Row.
- "**Stoneling**", affectionate, informal, reclaimed by younger Durhadan.
- "**Forgefolk**", a common nickname used in trade districts.
- "**Delvers**", seldomly heard outside elder circles.
- "**Dwarf**", on forms written in Taldane (common), educated folk know better.
# Elf
**Elf:** Among the city’s brickwork and burning pace, the elves move like long shadows. Some journey from the Mierani Forest to study, teach, or vanish into arcane politics. Others are born in Korvosa and wrestle with what that means, caught between lifetimes of memory and the urgency of a city that forgets itself every ten years.

Many who can’t—or won’t—conform gather in **Stillgrass**, a mosaic-splashed quarter west of Midland where elves, gnomes, and other outcasts have carved something new. Here, witches and threadbinders sell spells next to tea stalls and sculptors. It’s not wealthy, and it’s not quiet, but it’s home. Elves who live here carry their stories like old jewelry—tarnished, treasured, and never for sale.

- **Calithil**, his voice is etched into the acoustics of the marble concert hall of the Jeggare Museum.
- **Evrine Shadeweft**, a lacewright in Stillgrass.
- **Sarinda Tal’Aven**, called The Last Visitor, has outlived every landlord in Strake Alley.
- "**Whispers**", silent intermediaries and keepers of old truths.
- "**Glasswalker**", Korvosan term for city-born elves.
- "**Longbloods**", rough, dismissive, used by humans.
- "**Léthuinnar**", elf in elvish, meaning *those who endure the bloom*.
# Gnome
Though never numerous, gnomes are a distinct and memorable presence in Korvoas. They are often viewed as eccentric outsiders--welcomed in theory for their creativity and novelty, but subtly marginalized in practice due to their strange customs, ever-changing interests, and sometimes chaotic energy. Still, Korvosa is a place that values usefulness, and no one can deny the gnomes' knack for innovation, artistry, and practical genius.

Communities in which gnomes are known to have a place:
- [[Clockspire Fellowship]] ([[Heights District]])
- [[Embercoil Market]] ([[Bridgefront]], [[pathfinder/curse_of_the_crimson_throne/Old Korvosa]])
- [[The Latchkey House]] ([[North Point]])

How they fit the campaign:
- They can be an agent of change--literally disrupting outdated systems with inventions, ideas, or performances.
- Their outsider status allows them to observe Korvosa's power struggles without being tied to its nobility or traditions.
- They could be fighting to prove that adaptability and curiosity are virtues, even in a city that fears unpredictability.

No one’s ever accused a gnome of blending in, and the gnomes of Korvosa don’t try. Those who remain in the city proper—particularly in the ramshackle, overgrown district known as the _Verdant_—are fierce in their joy, stubborn in their creativity, and unafraid to delight in a world that too often insists on grim survival. For gnomes, passion isn’t just personality—it’s survival. The creeping curse known as the **Bleaching** still lurks for those who lose touch with curiosity, awe, and sensation. That danger has shaped a culture of deliberate intensity, especially among **Sensates**, who revel in new textures, flavors, and emotions as though their lives depend on it—because they do.  

Many **Fey-Touched** gnomes in Korvosa trace their heritage to a portal once hidden deep beneath the city’s old walls, now lost to time (or deliberately buried). They feel the Verdant as a sacred hearth, a place where street gardens burst through broken brick, song and spell are never far apart, and even grief is expressed with color. These gnomes don’t all get along—debate is a joy in itself—but they are united in their refusal to let Korvosa grind them into silence.

- **Pimm Flintcoil**, one time Ironworks smelter and rumored *solly* sympathizer, who thinks (loudly) a group of Durhadan artisans could change the city—if they’d just listen to Pimm.
- **Dilly Vinecap**, founder of _Vivid_, a once-a-Tenday pop-up fair in [[Embercoil Market]] where you can trade memories (and other rarities) for handcrafted potions, stolen flowers, or stranger things.
- **Wiggen the Eighth**, a wide-eyed young gnome who claims to be the reincarnation of an ancient fey prince… again.
- **“Bit the flarespool”**, said of someone chasing an extreme sensory experience. Equal parts admiration and concern.
- **“Lusterdebt”**, the unspoken bond owed to someone who reawakens your wonder.
- **“Colorless hour”**, a time of emotional numbness or creative block; treated seriously.)

# Goblin
Korvosa never meant to keep its goblins. But it turns out if you let enough scrap and song build up in the alleys, some of them stay.

Goblins in Korvosa are survivors of many kinds—refugees from distant raids, gutter kids who slipped the leash of cruel handlers, or the children of workers who took city jobs no one else wanted. Most were never invited in. They carved out lives anyway.

Nowhere is this clearer than in **Scraptown**, a sprawling goblin co-op in [[Old Dock]]. Here, goblin artisans smelt scrap metal into sculptures, armor, and the occasional unlicensed cookpot grenade. They form loud, vibrant households, host absurdly competitive pie fights, and sing nightly songs that scare the drakes off the rooftops. If you need something fixed, old or new, you could do worse than take it to **Scraptown**.

- **Fizzik Button**, junk tailor and knife dancer who keeps a tab at every bar in Midland—and pays it in gossip, not coin.
- **Nok-Nok-No**, fire singer turned street preacher, swears the city will burn in beauty, not in blood.
- **Greep Slunkbelly**, information broker in **Eel's End** with uncanny knowledge about Guard activity.
- **“Cookfire’s ready”**, a warning something is about to explode, whether tempers or experiments.
- **“Shiny-side up”**, a goblin raised in the city; proud, scrappy, a bit smug.
- **“Guts and glimmer”**, Someone who's bold and flashy, not necessarily smart.
# Halfling
Halflings in Korvosa don’t speak much of their origins—not because they’ve forgotten, but because they’ve learned to live in the now. They see themselves not as a people apart, but as members of households, corners, districts, and routines. For some, that means years of loyal service to a noble family, accounting gold sail, polishing every crest. For others, it means found family and full hearts in places like **Latchkey House**, brewing kettle-thick stews and tending rooftop gardens. What they share is a love of simple pleasures and a deep emotional attachment to the patterns of daily life. Order brings comfort. Familiarity breeds joy.  

They nest. They host. They take pride in a well-kept ledger, a shopfront no one else bothers to beautify, or a morning mug of coffee just the way they like it. Halflings who serve corrupt households might still fiercely defend their work—not out of loyalty to power, but because a good job _ought_ to mean something. And those who live in the cracks of the city often become its fiercest protectors, extending hospitality to those without any. A halfling might not tell you what they believe, but watch where they return to at dusk, and you’ll see where their heart lies.

- **Jassa Two-Kneads**, runs a sweetroll cart in Pillar Hill, access to any other "sweets" you desire.
- **Mintri Gowlamp**, the housekeeper no one in Castle Korvosa dares cross, not even the Queen's retinue.
- **Tassa Brightreed**, the gregarious quartermaster of Latchkey House who names all her blankets and thinks every soul deserves a second chance.
- **Pelder the Quiet**, A clerk in the Magistrate of Commerce's office.
- **"[[The Carry]]"** – The invisible weight halflings are expected to bear—often with a wink, or a grim smile.
- **"Brightcup"** – A term of affection for a halfling child or someone untested but cheerful.
- **"Belowstairs"** – A polite (or not-so-polite) way of saying someone grew up in noble service.
- **"Two-Shoes Talk"** – Courteous, polished speech, often used when speaking to nobility or authority.
# Human
Humans are the majority in Korvosa, but that unity ends at the census. Chelish families built the city, and many still run it—by blood, charter, or habit. Some embrace the order and tradition of old Cheliax, while others seek to break from it, pushing for reform or carving out quiet lives behind estate walls. 

Varisians are more visible in the streets than in the halls of power. Often treated with suspicion, many have found work as laborers, performers, or traders. The Sczarni are still blamed for every theft and murder, though most Varisians want nothing to do with them. Their stories endure—sometimes in whispers, sometimes in defiance.  

Shoanti presence in the city is small but constant. Some families live in Skaldwood under a fraught treaty, others scattered across Korvosa, enduring old wounds and quiet discrimination. Their traditions survive despite it. A few have begun to speak louder, organizing for recognition, respect, and return.

To be human in Korvosa is to live within a legacy you didn’t choose—sometimes upheld, sometimes resisted, but never ignored.
# Leshy
# Orc
Orcs in Korvosa don’t come in legions—they come in families. Often descended from mercenaries, freed slaves, or refugees from **Belkzen** and the Hold of Belkzen’s border towns, many orcs here are just trying to get by like anyone else. Their strength might open doors in the labor guilds, or get them hired on for protection runs through the Narrows or Midland, but it rarely earns them respect.

Korvosa sees orcs through a lens of old wars and gutter prejudices, but the reality is more complicated. Many orcs grow up in mixed neighborhoods, speaking fluent Taldane, picking up odd jobs, and caring for aging kin. Others drift toward fringe work—dock brawlers, street fighters, debt collectors—because that’s where their reputation fits best.

In truth, orcs are no monolith. Some chase civic ambition, others live quiet lives of craft and care. Some bristle under the stares. Others turn it into swagger. But all orcs in Korvosa carry the burden of being seen as what they are not: brutal, thoughtless, dangerous. What they _are_ depends on the person—like anyone else.

- **Brakka Ironsmoke**, a smith with lungs like bellow and arms like tree trunks, working the forge outside her tiny shop in Garrison Hill.
- **Uzhmak "Redcoat" Gorr**, a decorated veteran of the Sable Company, turned unofficial community watch captain in Bridgefront.
- **Dotha the Shorn**, war priest of Gorum, known to offer sanctuary to street fighters and outcasts near Racker's Alley.
- "**Gor-blooded**", used by Dromaar for those with battle talent, term of respect.
- "**Crack-tusk**", too proud to back down, even when fighting is futile.
- "**The Second Blow**", A proverb: "The first blow is survival. The second is choice." Used when someone claims agency after a lifetime of hardship.
# Ysoki
In Korvosa, the world "ratfolk" is often whispered with suspicion-yet some know them better by their true name: Ysoki, the clever kind who move between the floorboards of power and necessity.

Most live on the margins-below the city, tucked into reclaimed cisterns, shipwreck husks, or behind stonework thought to be hollow, but
