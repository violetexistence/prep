The most prestigious district in [[Korvosa]], The Heights is a place of sweeping views, old money, and carefully maintained appearances. Grand estates and civic buildings rise along clean stone streets, watched over by guards and tradition in equal measure. It’s home to the city’s nobility, ruling bureaucrats, and the infamous [[Acadamae]], Korvosa’s arcane academy. Outsiders may find The Heights cold or unwelcoming, but even here, not all is as it seems. Empty manors whisper of lost fortunes. Some nobles chafe under old expectations. And the [[Acadamae]], while cloaked in power, hides tensions both magical and moral. Characters from The Heights might be disillusioned heirs, ambitious scholars, household staff, or reformers in disguise—those who know that even the highest towers can crack from within.
