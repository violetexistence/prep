Vancaskerkin is a handsome man who still wears his Korvosan Guard livery and armor, even though he abandoned everything it stands for by organizing an anti-monarchist gang in Old Korvosa.

> *Korvosa’s got enough troubles as it is without my own guards losing their way. Many have deserted their posts, more concerned about friends and family than the city. I can understand this, yet not all of the deserters have fmaily—some of them are simply using the riots as an excuse for personal gain. One such man is Verik Vancaskerkin. Worse than a lone deserter, he’s convinces a small group of fellow guards that Queen Ileosa is going to ruin the city.* - Field Marshal Cressida Kroft

Sargeant Verik Vancaskerkin is not brilliant by any stretch of the imagination, but he has always been opportunistic. The sergeant probably should have hung his ambitions up the first time he was contacted by a woman named [[Meliya Arkona]], but the sensuous prodigal daughter of the powerful [[Arkona]] family proved most persuasive.

The Arkonas are one of Korvosa’s oldest noble families, and thanks to their strong ties and regular trade with the distant country of [[Vudra]], they’re one of Korvosa’s wealthiest. Rare and exotic imports from Vudra guarantee the Arkonas’ continued wealth, and it was on this foundation that the family rose in power to become the de facto rulers of Old Korvosa, the large island just north of the city proper. The family’s own open acceptance of all manner of vice has certainly influenced the growth of Old Korvosa, yet it nevertheless keeps things under relatively tight control, so the Arkonas are viewer as heroes by much of Old Korvosa’s lower class and as troublemakers by most of the rest of the city. But the Arkonas’ true secret is one of Korvosa’s best kept—the leader of this family are rakshasas.

One of these rakshasas is a woman named [[Vimanda]], and it is in her guise as Meliya Arkona that she’s been stealthily infiltrating dozens of organizations and families throughout Korvosa, building a network of contacts she hopes to come day use to her advantage. Her chosen contact among the Korvosan Guard was a man of high enough rank to wield some power, but not high so as to be the center of attention—Verik Vancaskerkin.

It was through Vimanda’s contacts and her pulling of strings that Verik blazed through the lower ranks to make watch sergeant. With little more going for him that a fit physique, piercing eyes, and a winning smile, Vancaskerkin has done well for himself, but he has set his sights higher, and he definitely doesn’t know when to quit.

Right after Queen Ileosa ascended the throne, the Arkonas saw the end of the current monarchy blowing in the wind. With the right moves, they hope to topple Ileosa and claim the throne for themselves by installing a puppet prince. When the protests, strikes, and violence began, Vimanda quickly contacted Verik (who believes her to be nothing more than his secret Vudrani lover, Meliya) and convinced him to gather this closest friends, forsake the Guard, and claim control of an old butcher’s shop. As the Arkonas suspected, food has quickly become a source of contention in Korvosa, with regular shipments of meat and produce from outlying farms cut off. Already, Vancaskerkin and his gang have gathered a sizable following throughout Northgate, and when that following is large enough, the Arkonas plan to step in an mobilize an army.

Vancaskerkin is in his early twenties. He escaped early from the streets of Riddleport to seek his fortune elsewhere, leaving behind several siblings, but the only one he misses is his older brother, Orik, a strong role model in Verik’s younger years. Last Verik heard, Orik has been forced to flee Riddleport as well, after a scandal involving a sex worker and an alchemist. Verik hopes some day to take the time to return to Riddleport and track down his brother, but for now, his secret dutues to Meliya increasingly keep his attention.
