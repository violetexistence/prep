Korvosa is a city of high towers, hidden corners, and deep contradictions. It’s a place that claims order as a virtue, values routine like religion, and teaches you early to keep your papers in order and your head on a swivel. If you live here long enough, you learn how to read a patrol’s footsteps before you hear them, how to find warmth when the law won’t offer shelter, and how to smile like you belong—even when you don’t.
### The Korvosan Mindset
To live in Korvosa is to understand that appearances matter. Wealth, education, family name—these speak loudly here. But so too does grit. Competence is sacred. Order is divine. Weakness, or the appearance of it, draws stares. Or worse. People here believe in keeping things in their place—whether that’s a coin in your ledger, a child in their ward, or your voice inside your throat.

The city moves on structure and regulation like gears in a clockwork—and the people tend to reflect that. Routines are sacred. Disturb one, and you’ll hear about it. Break a law, and you’ll feel it. Laws here are many, amended, and brutally specific. Korvosa has no patience for what it sees as unnecessary mess, and its punishments skew harsh. But within that rigidity, there’s a kind of logic. Even the underworld has an official arm.

The Cerulean Society—Korvosa’s licensed thieves’ guild—pays its dues. So long as they don’t draw too much blood or break the wrong kind of rule, they’re allowed to operate in plain sight. Better, the thinking goes, to have an organized vice than a chaotic one. Some say it keeps the worst of the city’s shadows predictable. Others say that’s how you build a cage.
### Taxes and Tolls
If you can measure it, Korvosa probably taxes it. Landing a boat, owning property, brewing spirits, even selling dreams—everything has a fee. The system is dense, the math arcane, and the ledgers bloated with amendment and footnote. Vice is taxed too. If you traffic in certain pleasures—shiver, flesh, fortune telling—you can pay a vice tax, declare your earnings, and enjoy a measure of legal protection. But get caught without paying, and the Guard won’t be kind.

The tax collector is a loathed but permanent figure in Korvosan life. Magistrate Garrick Tann, the man behind the ledgers, is widely cursed in bars, alleyways, and under the breath of market vendors from Pillar Hill to Old Dock. Few understand how taxes are set. Fewer still believe they’re fair. But everyone pays them—unless you’re powerful enough not to.
### Work and Business
Korvosa outlawed trade guilds long ago, fearing that collectives might grow bold enough to challenge authority. Today, most workers are independent or apprenticed. That hasn’t stopped solidarity—it’s just driven it underground. Still, for all its rigidity, the city depends on its workers, and there are protections in place (in theory) to keep employers from bleeding them dry. In practice, knowing the right magistrate matters more than any printed statute.

That same relentless drive—the need to prove yourself worthy of the city’s approval—keeps merchants sharp and markets thriving. The competition is brutal, but those who master the rhythms of Korvosa’s economy often thrive, so long as they don’t get too noisy about it.
### Coin of the Realm
Korvosa mints its own coinage through the Bank of Abadar, and while Chelaxian coins are still accepted, Korvosans take pride in their own currency. Every pinch, shield, sail, and crown is stamped with imperial clarity.

- **Pinch (Copper)** – The smallest unit, so named because it’s what you’re left with after taxes. Locals just say _pinch_—call them _coppers_ and you’ll out yourself as a newcomer.
- **Shield (Silver)** – Called by its full name to avoid confusion with anything meant to stop an arrow.
- **Sail (Gold)** – Always pronounced clearly; never shortened. Confusing this with “sails” (meaning ships) is a quick way to sound foolish.
- **Crown (Platinum)** – The rarest coin, sometimes spoken of with a touch of sarcasm. If someone “pays in crowns,” they’re either wildly wealthy or wildly desperate to look like they are.
