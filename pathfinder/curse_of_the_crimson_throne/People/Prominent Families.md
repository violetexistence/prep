Power in Korvosa doesn’t only come from coin, charisma, or conviction—it often comes stamped with a noble seal. While wealth can buy access, true influence in Korvosa's politics and society tends to flow from the city's noble houses. These families form an ever-shifting hierarchy of prestige, legacy, and favor, jockeying for power in a city that remains, officially, a colony of Cheliax.

Noble titles in Korvosa come not from the city itself, but from Cheliax—a fact the aristocracy takes very seriously. Most noble houses here are splinters of much older Chelish lineages, though a few are native to Korvosa. None can claim absolute power, and even the royal family lacks the authority to grant noble titles locally. The throne and the nobility exist in a delicate, sometimes dangerous, balance—both sides vying for sway with the city’s elite merchant houses and institutions.

Below are some of Korvosa's most notable families and the roles they play in the city's future—and its secrets.

House Arabasti (Royal Family)
Once outsiders to Cheliax’s noble sphere, the Arabastis fought their way into influence with cunning, ambition, and no small amount of luck. King Eodred I's rise from commoner to monarch was as much theater as it was politics, but the title stuck—and so did the dynasty, despite Cheliax never recognizing the royal claim.

Queen Domina Arabasti, a distant relative from Cheliax and fervent Asmodean, brought legitimacy and prosperity to the crown through harsh order and relentless expansion. Her son, King Eodred II, inherited the throne but little of her discipline. His lavish indulgences have strained the city's coffers and patience, leaving the people uneasy, especially in light of his recent marriage to the ambitious young Queen Ileosa.

House Arkona
Wealthy, worldly, and more than a little feared, House Arkona is one of the most enigmatic noble families in Korvosa. Their fortunes turned around after a mysterious voyage to Vudra, returning with a ship full of exotic goods and, some whisper, secrets.

While officially lauded for their public works and philanthropic efforts, especially under Lord Glorio Arkona, the family is widely believed to maintain deep ties to Korvosa's criminal underworld. The Arkona estate atop Garrison Hill stands as both a symbol of their success and a warning to those who might challenge their dominion in Old Korvosa.

House Bromathan
Faithful and traditional, House Bromathan maintains a quiet but steadfast presence in Korvosa's noble landscape. Though once known for its military service, its current head, Lord Valdur Bromathan IV, broke with that tradition to serve as a priest of Sarenrae.

Still loyal to House Endrin and respected for their consistency, the Bromathans avoid political maneuvering, preferring to support the city’s institutions from behind the scenes.

House Endrin
A family built on sacrifice, House Endrin has long upheld Korvosa’s martial tradition. It has produced more leaders of the Sable Company and the Korvosan Guard than any other house, and its legacy is written in both blood and battlefield honors.

Though smaller and younger than many other noble families, the Endrins remain influential thanks to their deep ties to the city’s military and to House Jeggare.

House Jeggare
Arguably the wealthiest house in Korvosa, House Jeggare controls vast shipping interests and a significant portion of the city’s docks. Known for their financial savvy, the Jeggares hold quiet influence through loans, trade networks, and civic sponsorship.

They rarely engage in overt political struggles but are almost always involved, one way or another, in the background of any major development.

House Leroung
Scholars, teachers, and stewards of knowledge, House Leroung is best known for founding the University of Korvosa. While other houses chase coin or power, the Leroungs build legacies through academia and public education.

Lady Eliasia Leroung, the current head of house and university chancellor, is well-liked even by rival houses—a rare feat in Korvosan politics.

House Ornelos
Control over the Acadamae has granted House Ornelos outsized power in Korvosa, and they are not shy about wielding it. From its founding, this house has dominated arcane education and placed countless members in high-ranking political and administrative roles.

Though the family publicly distances itself from devil worship, the Acadamae’s conjuration-focused curriculum and rumored infernal practices cast a long shadow. Their influence, however, remains unshakable.

House Zenderholm
A relative newcomer to the peerage, House Zenderholm rose to prominence after the Cousins’ War, leveraging military loyalty and legal acumen. Today, its members are known as arbiters, magistrates, and diplomats.

Lady Mulsanne Zenderholm, known as "the Hanging Judge" for her unwavering adherence to the law, exemplifies the house's current reputation: stern, fair, and unafraid to speak uncomfortable truths.
