## The Burned-Out Bigot

**Corruption Archetype**: _The Resentful Enforcer_
**What He Tells Verik**: “They never respected the Guard. Now they’ll learn.”

Malder was once proud to serve, but years of being mocked, overlooked, and passed over turned him into a hateful, wheezing mess. He **blames the poor, the Shoanti, the Varisians—anyone** the Guard was expected to protect. He relishes the Cow Hammer Boys because now he gets to lash out and call it justice. Verik thinks Malder is “just angry”—but Malder is **dangerously ideological** and close to joining a real death cult of civic cleansing.
