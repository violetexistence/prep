### Government
Korvosa's power structure is a complex dance between old charters, entrenched institutions, and a monarchy that rules more by consensus than decree. It wasn’t always this way, and it may not always stay this way—but for now, it works. Mostly.

#### Arbiters
These judges serve as both interpreters of law and guardians of balance. Any royal decree must first pass their review—a seven-vote panel where five must agree to uphold it. They also preside over criminal and civil trials, and while many citizens believe the king has the final say, most rulings never reach the throne. The system isn’t perfect, but many arbiters take pride in defending the city’s charter and ensuring no one, not even a monarch, acts without accountability.

#### Commandant of the Sable Company
The city's elite aerial cavalry answers not to the king, but to the seneschal of Castle Korvosa. The Sable Company, and its current leader Commandant Marcus Endrin, swears loyalty to the crown, but only so long as the crown serves Korvosa. This creates a quiet but important check on royal power. The commandant's autonomy is protected by charter: they must come from a bloodline distant from the current monarch's, ensuring no familial loyalty clouds their duty to the people.

#### Field Marshal of the Korvosan Guard
The city's boots-on-the-ground protectors answer to the monarch, but not without limits. The Field Marshal commands the largest armed force in Varisia and has the legal right to refuse orders that threaten civilians or violate the law. It's a heavy burden, one currently shouldered by Field Marshal Cressida Kroft, who walks the fine line between enforcing justice and surviving palace politics.

#### The Magistrates
A patchwork of bureaucracy lives in City Hall, with 23 magistrates and their sprawling staffs overseeing everything from sewer maintenance to festival licensing. The joke is that no one really knows what they all do—but some of them are undeniably powerful:
- **Garrick Tann**, Magistrate of Commerce, collects taxes, regulates fees, and thwarts union formation. He is, predictably, the most hated man in Korvosa.
- **Syl Gar**, Magistrate of Expenditures, controls the purse strings. Unlike his counterpart, Syl is welcome in most guild halls and merchant houses.
- **Lolia Perenne**, Magistrate of Regulation, ensures fair trade and honest scales. A devout priest of Abadar, her work is often thankless but vital.

#### Lictor of the Order of the Nail
The Hellknights of the Order of the Nail operate on coin and principle in equal measure. Their leader, Lictor Severs DiVri, lives outside the city in Citadel Vraid but sends troops into Korvosa when paid to enforce law with grim efficiency. The lictor is a hired sword for order—and one Korvosa doesn’t call lightly.

#### The Monarch
Korvosa's monarchs are powerful in name, but their every step is measured against charters, amendments, and tradition. King Eodred II may sit the Crimson Throne, but he must court the favor of arbiters, guards, nobles, and commoners alike to keep his grip on power. He is not the first king to find the throne a gilded cage.

The monarch commands the city guard, appoints its leadership, and steers the city’s direction—but always within the bounds of law. And always beneath the shadow of the Crimson Throne’s curse: no ruler has died peacefully, nor produced a true heir while seated upon it.

#### The Seneschal
Castle Korvosa's seneschal maintains control of the structure and serves as a check against royal overreach. In theory, the seneschal could seal the castle and imprison the king within it, though no one has tested that clause—yet. Neolandus Kalepopolis currently holds the post and is rumored to be grooming Marcus Endrin as his successor.

#### Peerage Review
An advisory board made up of representatives from the five Great Houses, the Peerage Review holds little formal power, but considerable informal sway. While their unanimous vote can override orders to the Korvosan Guard, that authority has never been used. Still, no monarch ignores the Peerage lightly—especially not one hoping to stay on the throne for long.

In all, Korvosa's government is a messy weave of checks and balances, ambition and tradition, but it is resilient. Its people have learned to navigate the cracks and push through them. They’re not waiting for permission. They’re building something better anyway.
