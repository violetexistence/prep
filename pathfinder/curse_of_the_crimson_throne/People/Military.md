Korvosa’s defense rests in the hands of three distinct military organizations. Though they serve the same city, each maintains its own jurisdiction, traditions, and chain of command. These forces don’t always see eye to eye—but when Korvosa is threatened, they stand together… more or less.
## Korvosan Guard
The Korvosan Guard serves three things: the city first, the monarchy second, and the Church of Abadar third. In peaceful times, the Guard acts as a police force. In times of crisis, it mobilizes into a standing army. In all things, it represents the oldest and most established martial tradition in the city.

The Guard traces its roots to the regular army troops brought to Endrin Isle by Field Marshal Korvosa himself. Though support from the Church of Abadar bolsters its ranks with divine magic and civic structure, the Guard remains firmly tied to its Chelaxian legacy. Officers include paladins and priests of Abadar, and the Guard works closely with both the Sable Company and the Order of the Nail when major threats arise.

Field Marshal **Cressida Kroft** currently leads a force of nearly 700 soldiers. While the Guard is technically open to all peoples of the city, only humans of full Chelaxian blood may attain the rank of general or field marshal, and only those with at least half-Chelaxian ancestry may rise above the rank of captain. Nevertheless, Varisians, Shoanti, and members of other ancestries serve with distinction.
## Order of the Nail
Fifteen miles south of Korvosa, the black-iron fortress of **Citadel Vraid** houses the Order of the Nail, one of the original seven Hellknight orders. Harsh, unyielding, and absolute in their commitment to law, the Order of the Nail does not answer to city leadership but enforces its own brand of discipline across Varisia.

Brought to the region in 4682 by Queen Domina, the Order believes strength and order must be imposed—by steel if necessary. Its signifers call upon extraplanar beings of law, often devils, not for worship but for mastery. Morality is secondary to structure. Order is everything.

The Order of the Nail is commanded by **Lictor Severs “Boneclaw” DiVri**, with **Mistress of Blades Maidrayne Vox** overseeing its martial arms and **Paravicar Acillmar** directing its arcane ranks. Their presence in Korvosa is tolerated, occasionally welcomed, and often feared. The city government contracts them for special operations, but tension lingers from the Order’s refusal to submit fully to the crown in years past—a slight the monarchy hasn’t forgotten.

Though the people of Korvosa often call them “Domina’s Devils,” few dare speak against them openly.
## Sable Company
The skies and waters of Korvosa belong to the **Sable Company**, elite marines mounted on hippogriffs and trained for rapid deployment. Their chain of command is unlike any other in the city: by tradition and law, the Sable Company answers not to the monarch, but to the **Seneschal of Castle Korvosa**. This separation, enshrined in the city charter, was designed to preserve balance—and, if necessary, serve as a check against royal overreach.

Founded by **Waydon Endrin**, the Sable Company began as a sea force and evolved into an elite corps. Today, they coordinate closely with the Korvosan Guard and assist during large-scale emergencies. Though they maintain a respectful distance from the Hellknights and the Acadamae, they often provide critical support in aerial or amphibious operations.

**Commandant Marcus Thalassinus Endrin** leads the Sable Company. While it shares the Guard’s Chelaxian roots, it is slightly more inclusive: any human may rise as high as general, and other ancestries may attain the rank of major. In practice, every commandant has been a noble of Chelaxian descent—but that may yet change.
