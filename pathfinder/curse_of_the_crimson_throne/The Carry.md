The Carry is a quiet phrase with many meanings. On the surface, it refers to the everyday burdens halflings shoulder without complaint—trays in the palace kitchens, ledgers in noble counting rooms, laundry baskets in **Bridgefront**. But to those who understand, it means something deeper: the invisible weight halflings bear to keep the city running, the emotional labor of smoothing over frayed tempers, the quiet endurance of those who nest in the margins of power.

To say someone knows the Carry is a mark of respect. It means they do what needs doing, no matter who gets the credit. It means they show up, steady and unshaken, while the world leans just a little on their shoulders.
