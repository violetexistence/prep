# The Tie That Binds
All kinds of people get swept up in Korvosa’s underworld. Hired blades prowl the slums near the waterfront, while shopkeepers tucked away in the Shingles pay protection money just to keep their doors open. Most of them aren’t criminals—just caught in the churn. The machine turns, and they try not to be crushed beneath it.

From their manors in the Heights, the city’s wealthiest families pull strings behind the scenes, influencing the Arbiters and shaping laws that cement their control. The Korvosan Guard, sworn to protect the people, often ends up protecting the structure that keeps them in place. Those who can live within the system—peacefully or otherwise—tend to manage. Those who can’t often survive by preying on those who can, knowing the Guard can only prevent a fraction of the harm done. Those who get caught are punished. Those who don’t? Thrive.

Among the worst of the predators are the city’s many crime lords. Dozens operate at any given time—ranging from the deadly reach of the Red Mantis assassins to low-tier Sczarni bosses who control no more than a single street corner. Ironically, it’s often the smallest of them who do the most damage to everyday citizens. Larger syndicates have bigger goals. Petty tyrants, on the other hand, target anyone they can.

One such is Gaedren Lamm, a bitter has-been clinging to the dregs of power. Once he dreamed of ruling the underworld; now he runs a cruel little racket from the shadows. Too old and broken for real muscle, he abducts orphans and uses them to steal, spy, and scam for him. Everyone in the city’s lower quarters seems to have heard his name, and even the nobility have found their lives complicated by his petty cruelties. Yet no matter what he does, Lamm always seems to slip through the cracks, too small to matter, too careful to catch.

But Gaedren’s luck is about to run out.

Among those he’s hurt are people who won’t let it stand—people who are about to become some of Korvosa’s greatest heroes.

One of them is you.
# Backgrounds
Even before Curse of the Crimson Throne begins, you and the other PCs share something in common--you have all been wronged, in some manner, by the despicable Gaedren Lamm. The campaign you are about to being starts as you and several other promising heroes are brought together to do what the city guards cannot (or will not) do--to see that Gaedren Lamm is held to account, be that in a court of law or at the edge of vengeful blade.

Presented here are nine suggested backgrounds you can choose for your character, historical snippets that explain how you have been affected in the past. Each background presents an unfortunate event, painted in broad strokes so you can customize it to your needs, that helped shape your character. Feel free to adapt and rework the particulars of your chosen background to fit your history. So long as you have a reason to see Gaedren suffer, you'll have a built-in reason to take up a life of adventuring and, more importantly, a reason to bond with your new companions

Obviously, you can take any of the standard backgrounds instead. If you do, just make sure to weave in this essential motivation into your character. Use the snippets here as inspiration.

# Addict
## Background
---
==uncommon==
You’ve seen firsthand what shiver can do. This glittering, dream-laced drug—distilled from the venom of dream spiders—offers a fleeting escape from pain and despair. In the darkness of Korvosa’s alleys and tenements, where the future feels like a slow fall, some take it as a last resort. But the cost is high. The dreams it grants are vivid, yes—but the waking world becomes all the crueler by contrast.
You always thought addiction was something that happened to other people. But then someone close to you—someone who mattered—slipped too far. Maybe they didn’t come back. Maybe they did, but not the same. Either way, your path changed that day.
Your search for answers led you through whispers and alleyway deals, and finally to a name: Gaedren Lamm. He’s no kingpin, just a small-time monster with a cruel streak and a long reach. The Guard won’t lift a finger. They have “bigger problems.” But to you, this is the biggest problem—and you’re not letting it slide.
Choose one of the following:

##### Addicted Friend
Someone you love—friend, sibling, partner—fell victim to shiver’s grip. Whether they survived or not, your eyes are open now. You’ve spent long nights walking the edges of Korvosa’s drug trade, and you’ve learned how to listen, how to keep your head down, and how to ask the right questions without making enemies.
Choose two ability boosts. One must b e to **Wisdom** or **Charisma**. The other is a free boost. 
You are trained in the **Society** skill and the **Underworld Lore** skill. You gain the **[Streetwise](https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=5218)** skill feat.

##### Personal Addiction
You were the one who fell. Shiver nearly broke you—but you crawled back. Maybe you still wake up with shakes. Maybe you’ll always be one bad day away from slipping again. But you survived, and now you know how deep the rot goes. You won’t let anyone else suffer the way you did. Not if you can stop it.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Constitution**. The other is a free boost.
You are trained in the **Medicine** skill and **Drugs Lore** skill. You gain the **[Assurance](https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=5121)** skill feat in **Medicine**.

# Exploited
## Background
---
==uncommon==
You once had ties to the Acadamae, Korvosa’s prestigious and deeply feared academy of magic. Maybe you were a student with promise—or a servant, researcher, assistant, or sibling of someone who studied within those wards. You were close enough to see how power works in Korvosa: it protects those in favor and chews up the rest.
Gaedren Lamm found a way into that world, too. Perhaps he sold spell components to desperate students, blackmailed a professor, or hired you for something quiet and ugly. Maybe he found you when you were still bright-eyed and new, offering coin, flattery, or forbidden knowledge. Then, as always, he used and discarded you. When you spoke up, no one listened. The Acadamae protects its own. Gaedren doesn’t.
But you’ve survived. You’ve learned. And now you’re ready to return—not as a student, but as someone who finally knows what to do with that knowledge.
Choose one of the following:

##### Arcane Castoff
You were a student—fully enrolled, or attending under a scholarship, apprenticeship, or family favor. A scandal involving Gaedren forced you to leave, your name dragged through the mud. You’ve never stopped studying. You’ll prove them all wrong—and make Gaedren pay for stealing your future.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Intelligence** or **Charisma**. The other is a free boost.
You are trained in the **Arcana** skill and the **Academia Lore** skill. You gain the [**Recognize Spell**](https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=5205) skill feat.

##### Thaumaturgic Assistant
You weren’t a student—just someone the Acadamae relied on. A cleaner. A note-runner. A stablehand for summoned mounts. You learned what you could in the quiet margins. Gaedren roped you into a deal: smuggling, sabotage, maybe just delivering a message. When it went wrong, you took the fall.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Wisdom**. The other is a free boost.
You are trained in the **Stealth** skill and the **Arcane Lore** skill. You gain the [**Quick Squeeze**](https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=5199) skill feat.

# Love Lost
## Background
---
==uncommon==
Someone you loved was taken from you—stabbed in a back alley, left to die alone. You were the one called in by the Korvosan Guard to identify the body, and though the memory of that moment will never leave you, something else stood out: a treasured ring they always wore was missing.
It didn’t take long for you to start digging. Weeks later, you found that ring in the display case of a local pawn broker. You couldn’t afford to buy it back, but the merchant told you where it came from: a petty criminal named **Gaedren Lamm**.
You don’t know if he wielded the knife himself or if someone else did it on his behalf. Either way, Gaedren has answers—and you intend to get them.
Choose one of the following:

##### Grieving Partner
You were their lover—someone who shared a life, a bed, and dreams for a future that’s now gone. You still feel the loss every day, but it’s shaped you into someone sharper, more focused. The grief burns clean, and it’s carried you this far. Now it’s time for justice.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Charisma**. The other is a free boost.
You are trained in the **Diplomacy** skill, and **Merchant Lore**. You gain the **Haggle** skill feat.

# Stolen Childhood
## Background
---
==uncommon==
You spend a period of time as one of Gaedren's enslaved orhpans. Maybe you were abducted from your paren't home or during a trip to the market. Perhaps the irresponsible matron who ruled your orphanage trade you to him in return for a desperately neded loan of money. Or perhaps you, like most of Gaedren's slaves, were merely a child of the street who succumbed to his promise of regular meals and a roof in return for what he said would be "a little light work." Whatever the case, you spent several years of your life as one of his "Little Lamms" before escaping. You've nursed a grudge for the old man ever since.
Choose one of the following:

##### Abandoned

# Missing Person
## Background
---
==uncommon==
You suspect that a person you know has been abducted by Gaedren. Whatever the relationship, you've heard rumors about Gaedren's "Little Lamms," and of how the oldman uses children as pickpockets and agents for his crimes. You've even heard rumors that the person you're looking for has been spotted in the marketplaces in the company of other known to be cutpurses and pickpockets. Although the Korvosan Guard has been understanding of your plight, they have had their hands full with "more important" matters. It seems they have not yet been able to learn anything more about Gaedren. No one else is interested in bringing Gaedren down and rescuing his victims--that task falls to you. Yet where could the old scoundrel be hiding?

# Burned Bridges
## Background

==uncommon==
You once worked for Gaedren Lamm—or at least alongside him. Maybe you were desperate. Maybe you didn’t ask too many questions. But when you tried to walk away, he made sure it cost you: threats, blackmail, or someone getting hurt. You’ve kept your head down since, rebuilding piece by piece, but you haven’t forgotten what he took from you. And now, you’re finally strong enough to go back and finish the job.
Choose one of the following:
##### Turned Against
You followed Gaedren for a time, until you saw the harm he caused—or felt it yourself. When you spoke out or tried to leave, his enforcers made sure you paid a price. The betrayal sharpened your instincts and hardened your nerves.

# Broken Bargain
## Background
---
==uncommon==
Once, Gaedren Lamm helped you. He gave you money, shelter, or protection when you had nowhere else to turn. But his kindness was a mask, and his generosity came with a cruel price. By the time you realized it, he already had leverage—and you had regrets. You’ve spent every day since trying to reclaim your life, but you know you’ll never be free until he’s gone.

You worked for Gaedren because you thought you owed him. Now you know better. His influence taught you how the city’s power games are played—and how to beat people like him at their own game.

# Legacy of the Blade
## Background

==uncommon==
Someone you admired—parent, mentor, sibling—once wore a uniform in defense of Korvosa: as a guard, a Hellknight, a member of Sable Company, or some other honorable role. They tried to bring Gaedren Lamm to justice and were broken for it. Forced into disgrace, reassigned, or quietly dismissed, they became a cautionary tale about what happens when you go after the wrong man. But you remember their courage. And now, you’re ready to take up their fight.

==uncommon==
You come from a part of Korvosa most people choose not to see—crumbling streets, shuttered shops, or homes barely hanging on. Gaedren Lamm has hurt your community, and the Guard doesn’t care.
