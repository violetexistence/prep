# Handwraps of the Reliquished Path
## Item 2

---

==Uncommon== ==Invested== ==Magical==
**Usage** worn gloves; Bulk L
**Weapon Group** Brawling
**Base Weapon** Fist

---

As you invest these embroidered strips of cloth, you must slowly wrap them around your hands, and remember all the things you swore to never do again. These handwraps have runes etched into them, making your unarmed attacks work like magic weapons. Specifically, they are etched with weapon potency runes, granting your unarmed attack rolls a +1 item bonus. 

You can upgrade, add, and transfer rune to and from the handwraps just as you would a weapon, and you can attach talismans to the handwraps.

---

**Description** faded linen bearing a soft, spiraled embroidery--sea-green and faded red--evoking emotion, memory, and regret. Sewn into the interior wrist seam is a single, deliberate stitch, knotted in the shape of a closed eye.

# Last Stitch
## Item 2

---
 ==Unique== ==Consumable== ==Talisman==
**Usage** Affixed to a crimson thread sewn into the interior wrist seam of the handwraps.
**Activation** `[free-action]` (concentrate); **Trigger** you critically fail a Will save, or an ally within 30 feet drops to 0 HP.

---

Tearing the thread from the interior wrist seam, the handwraps temporarily surge with destructive power. They gain the effects of a striking rune until the end of your next turn (i.e. your unarmed attacks deal an additional die of damage). You immediately gain the Doomed 1 condition.
