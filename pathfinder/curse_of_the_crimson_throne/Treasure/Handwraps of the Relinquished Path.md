**Base Weapon** Fist

These handwraps function as +1 handwraps of mighty blows, granting a +1 item bonus to unarmed attack rolls and allowing unarmed strikes to benefit from property runes or talismans.

**Description** faded linen bearing a soft, spiraled embroidery--sea-green and faded red--evoking emotion, memory, and regret. Sewn into the interior wrist seam is a single, deliberate stitch, knotted in the shape of a closed eye.

# Last Stitch
## Item 2

---
 ==Unique== ==Consumable== ==Talisman==
**Usage** Affixed to a crimson thread sewn into the interior wrist seam of the handwraps.
**Activation** `[free-action]` (concentrate); **Trigger** you critically fail a Will save, or an ally within 30 feet drops to 0 HP.

---

Tearing the thread from the interior wrist seam, the handwraps temporarily surge with destructive power. They gain the effects of a striking rune until the end of your next turn (i.e. your unarmed attacks deal an additional die of damage). You immediately gain the Doomed 1 condition.
