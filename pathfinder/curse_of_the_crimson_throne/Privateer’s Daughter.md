To my daughter,

You may never read this. And if you do — well, I’ll admit, that’s a surprise.

But if this letter’s reached you, then the vault’s opened, and the trust is yours. You’ll find enough inside to keep you steady for a long while — a roof, a future, and, gods willing, a little breathing room to figure out who you want to be. That was always the idea. Not to buy anything back — I know better than that — just to make sure the damage I caused didn’t follow you forever.

I’ve thought about you more times than I can count. Wondered who you became. What kind of life you’ve carved out. What kind of fire you’ve got in your belly.

I’d like to think you’re nothing like I was.

I was no kind of mother. That’s not false modesty — just plain fact. I wasn’t built for it. I didn’t even know who I was, let alone how to care for someone else. I was angry all the time, and cold, and tired in my bones. You didn’t do that to me. The world did. But I was the one who let it win.

Leaving you behind was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. I told myself it was mercy. That’s what cowards call it when they run.

So I ran — straight into the unknown, chasing something better. I didn’t know what I’d find. I still don’t know what you’ll think of it, if you ever come looking.

You don’t owe me a damn thing. Not your time. Not your kindness. Not a single word. But you deserve the truth.

— V

P.S. If there ever comes a day you wish to find me, start here:
