Crumbling stone, crowded rooftops, and tenacity define Old Korvosa. Once the heart of the city, this island district has become its most neglected and overburdened ward. Home to dockworkers, Varisian families, independent tradesfolk, and those simply trying to survive, Old Korvosa endures despite chronic overcrowding and a lack of official support. Crime festers where the Guard turns a blind eye, and the [[Cerulean Society]]—the city’s “official” thieves’ guild—operates openly here. But it’s not all lawlessness and shadow. Street performers, community leaders, and unlicensed healers offer sanctuary and strength, and whispers of revolt grow louder with each new injustice. Characters from Old Korvosa know how to scrape by, how to fight smart, and how to protect what’s theirs.
