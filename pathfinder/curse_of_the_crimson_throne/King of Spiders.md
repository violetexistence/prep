Callo tilts his head, puffing once more on his pipe before jerking it toward the wall behind the bar. "Then there's him."

The camera pans sharply as though snapped by a whip, pulling away from the No Winners Inn. The sounds of clinking mugs fades into the creak of ship wood, the slap of waves, and the buzz of a crowd that never sleeps.

Cut to: Eel's End.
A tangle of ships docked bow-to-stern, chained to the pilings like criminal sentenced to float forever. Lanterns swing from rope lines. The clamor of dice, distant moans, and guttering torchlight wash everything in gold and blood.

Callo's voice overlays the scene, flat and firm.

"Devargo doesn't need Tench. He doesn't need anybody. The King of Spiders owns his turf like it was written by the Last Azlantian. Rent's always paid. Spines always bowed. The Guard let him because he keeps his docks clean. He doesn't need a liability like Tench."

Back to: No Winners Inn. Callo doesn't look at you when adds:

"You end up at Eel's End, it's either for a good time or your last time. Tench knows better. That's a door that only opens for people got something to offer."
