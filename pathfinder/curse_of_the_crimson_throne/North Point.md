North Point is the face Korvosa shows to the world—efficient, industrious, and full of motion. Comprising the wards of [[Five Corners]], [[Mainshore]], [[Ridgefield]], and [[The Narrows]], this district includes some of the city’s oldest neighborhoods, as well as its most important centers of power. City Hall, the tallest building in the district, houses Korvosa’s civil bureaucracy and record-keeping offices, while banks and merchant consortiums in Ridgefield control much of the city’s financial lifeblood. Longtime residents—dockworkers, scribes, stewards, and small business owners—form the backbone of daily civic life.

Though well-patrolled and orderly, North Point is more pragmatic than pristine. Locals pride themselves on keeping things running, not keeping up appearances. It’s a district where a letter carrier, a coin-counter, and a customs officer might all share a drink at the same corner tavern. While the noble districts hoard tradition and spectacle, North Point quietly manages the city’s engine. Characters from this district may come from civic-minded families, old Varisian lineages, or trade-based enclaves, and are often driven by purpose, loyalty, or the belief that honest work can still shape a better future.
