Korvosa has long stood as the first bastion of civilization on the wild frontier of Varisia. Yet tragedy seems to haunt the city’s royal bloodline. Few of her rulers rule for long, and none have lived to a ripe old age, dying instead well before their time. Heirs to the throne are few and far between—in its 300-year history, no king of Korvosa has directly inherited the Crimson Throne from his father. This is the source of much gossip and tale-spinning among the city’s citizens, who speak in hushed tones of what they have come to call the Curse of the Crimson Throne.

# Noted Notables
Like the people of any other city, Korvosans concern themselves more with the day-to-day particulars of living than with politics, history, or macroeconomics. Still, Korvosa has a few particular nuances that make it and its citizens unique. The following overview only begins to touch on what it means to be a Korvosan.

At its height, just before the death of Aroden and the departure of the separatists who founded Magnimar, Korvosa just topped 23,000 inhabitants. It lost nearly 10,000 to the resulting chaos of the time, but in the last century it regained half that many. As a result of its rapid contraction and slow re-expansion, many of the aff luent sections of Korvosa remain underpopulated. With the buildings it has and the area it covers, Korvosa could comfortably fill out to a true metropolis.

The dichotomy of Korvosa’s underpopulated affluent wards with overcrowded Old Korvosa highlights the city’s greatest failing: the vast gulf of separation between its wealthy, powerful elite and its dreadfully impoverished poor. This gulf between social classes colors the development of the city and led to the creation of some of the features unique to Korvosa.

Those who live in Korvosa respect and admire ostentatious displays of wealth, power, or knowledge. They consider confidence and competence the greatest of assets, and they deride or heckle those who display weakness, indecisiveness, or inability. Korvosans are quick to judge and slow to forgive.

In addition to power, Korvosans love predictability. Korvosans like to regulate their lives, creating strict regimens for themselves that they slavishly follow. Upsetting a Korvosan’s routine can ruin his entire day and likely makes him angry. To this end, Korvosa strictly enforces its laws (which often have harsh punishments far in excess of the law codes of other non-evil governments) and rewards those who play by the rules. That said, Korvosa also recognizes that not everyone plays by the same rules, so it compensates by applying regulations to nonviolent criminals in the form of vice taxes and official recognition of the city’s single thieves’ guild.

By charter amendment, Korvosa does not allow merchants, laborers, or tradesmen to form guilds. Most workers within the city are self-employed or work for a master to whom they were apprenticed in their youths.

The city relies on these cottage industries and the skilled workers who make them profitable, so naturally it has one entire volume of laws and regulations devoted to the protection and rights of workers. And thanks to the Korvosan drive to succeed, the city’s merchants do well for themselves.

# Ancestries
As with any Adventure Path, Curse of the Crimson Throne support the vast majority  of character options, including ancestries. Korvosa is a large and cosmopolitan city with a diverse population. If the setting as written does not canonically support a significant community for the character you envision, it will support it as played. This is our Korvosa. There have been many like it in other campaigns, but this one is ours.

## Common Ancestries
Any common ancestry in *Player Core* can be found in Korvosa, a busy trading hub of Varisia. Humans are more represented than any other single ancestry and it has been humans who have controlled the Crimson Throne for 300 years.

### Human

#### Chelaxian
*pronounced che-LAX-ee-en*
Nine out of ten human Korvosans claim ***Chelish*** heritage. Most speak Taldane (Common), generally have first names followed by family names. As the dominant and most represented people in Korvosa, many of the important figures in history have these names. Descendants might be proud or ashamed of the actions and legacy of their famous ancestors. Some negative stereotypes include arrogance, ruthlessness, and ambition. More positive stereotypes include being organized, intelligent, and cultured. Those living in Korvosa tend to venerate [Abadar], [Erastil], [Iomedae], and [Zon-Kuthon].

Half of all human Korovans have at least one Varisian ancestor, yet only one in ten claim Varisian heritage. The language of Varisians is also called Varisian, and it is known for its subtle nuances and double meanings. Most Varisians also speak Taldane. They general have a given or chosen first name and a family name. They prefer intricate, multi-syllabic names beginning and ending in vowels, such as Alika, Esmerelda, Eugeni, Ionacu, Zeldana, and Zandu. Some positive stereotypes include loyalty, passion, resourcefulness, and wisdom. Negative stereotypes include rebelliousness, superstitiousness, and unreliability. Varisians pay homage to a wide variety of deities, but are commonly associated with [Desna].

Shoanti can be found in Korvosa in relatively small numbers. Those who call the city home have a hard time finding community with others of their heritage. Lack of power and resources as well as prejudice lingering from violent conflict with Korvosa's ruling class have left them
