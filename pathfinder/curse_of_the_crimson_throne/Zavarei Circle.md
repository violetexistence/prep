"Mmm, I see. Let's think this through then."  

Callo tops off your glass and taps the ash from his pipe into mug behind the bar. Over in the corner table, Cabbage Sam is on-boarding a couple of young rubes to his "fruit truck" business.   

"Who would have use of a fixer like Tench and could stomach him?"  

At this point I think we do a Scorsese style montage of various gangsters around Old Korvosa, with you and Callo doing a voice over.  

"The Ink Eater would have no compuction against a low rep sewer rat puttin on airs. They're always open to adding more debtors to their books." 

The camera wooshes dramatically to a maze of alleys near the seawall beneath Northbridge. Stone walls weep with salt water kept mostly at bay by 1000 year old Durhadan masonry. Where folk light candles in windows not for the gods, but for debts unpaid, and on quiet nights, seawater sometimes turns to ink and runs into the cobbles like blood. A woman in a black veil points at an unlit door. Moments later a gang of Sczarni hitters breaks down the door, the tenant dragged out into the street, and beaten before being forced to his knees before the veiled matron. She turns her hand palm up giving the kneeling man one last opportunity to pay up. Gasping for breath, spitting blood, the man pleads for more time, for a little understanding.  

"Mama Nurna is hardline though. She'd never trust anyone outside the family."  

The camera moves around behind the veiled woman who removes her face covering and raises both her arms in an open gesture to the spirits. The man, still kneeling begins to convulse. His eyes roll back and he begins to speak in a voice that is not his own, in a language we barely understand. The hitters let go of him and move away while the man proceeds to arch his back so far that he breaks his own spine, but continues to flop around the cobbles.  

Next, I'm going to let Meelo's player create one of our crime barons.

# Mama Nura Zavarei
_Blind matriarch of the Zavarei Circle, keeper of debts too old to speak aloud._

Whispers say Mama Nura was born under a veil and never saw the living world—only the shades beyond it. Her tiny home in Bridgefront smells of salt, ink, and burnt sugar, and is always full of candles lit for people no one else remembers. Spirits speak through her in riddles, and her word is law among many Sczarni. Even the Cerulean Society watches their step around her.

# The Ink Eater
_Her niece, her mouthpiece, her blade with a book._

She wears no sigils, only a long coat with ink-stained cuffs and contracts tattooed in fading lines across her ribs. The Ink Eater handles debts, deals, and disappearances. She’s the kind of person you don’t find—you get summoned by. Her specialty: long-term contracts so binding they feel like curses, always sealed in flesh and iron.
# Turf: The Weeping Veil
Nestled deep in Bridgefront, **the Weeping Veil** is a half-collapsing warren of alleys where the Zavarei Circle holds sway. Crumbling walls weep with salt-seep from old magic. Folk light candles in windows not for the gods, but for debts unpaid. On quiet nights, ink sometimes leaks from the cobbles like blood. Locals don’t speak Nura’s name aloud—she’s simply called “Grandmother” in hushed tones. Every Sczarni child is taught the three alleys you don’t run through. They all cut through the Veil.
# Ritual
When a Zavarei debt is sworn, the debtor cuts their palm and presses it to a black vellum page, leaving a bloody print. The Ink Eater traces their name in ink over the wound with a heated needle. The “Inkwake” binds the promise—not by law, but by something older. Break it, and the name fades from memory to all who once knew it… even kin. The only cure is the personal forgiveness of Mama Nura—rarely granted, often fatal.
# Background: Marked by the Ink Eater
You once signed something you didn’t fully understand. Maybe it was a protection contract. Maybe it was a plea. Maybe it was just a desperate promise to someone who helped you. The Ink Eater hasn’t collected yet—but you know she will. When she’s ready, she’ll find you. And until then? Your name appears in certain circles like a faint tattoo, pulsing just beneath the skin of the city.
