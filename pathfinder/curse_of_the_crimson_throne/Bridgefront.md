Bridgefront is a maze of leaning tenements, patched roofs, and skywalks that shouldn’t hold but somehow do. Technically part of [[pathfinder/curse_of_the_crimson_throne/Old Korvosa]], it’s a neighborhood unto itself—fiercely independent, artistically chaotic, and endlessly alive. Once a collection of shanties built along a collapsed bridge, Bridgefront has grown into a teetering community full of food stalls, rooftop markets, and makeshift homes where every plank has a story. Outsiders call it lawless; locals call it home. The Guard rarely patrols here, but the people look after their own, and mutual aid networks thrive where the city’s systems fail. Characters from Bridgefront tend to be clever, close-knit, and quietly revolutionary.
