## Royal Proclamation, Queen Ileosa Arbasti

> *Citizens of Korvosa—today our city grieves. His Majesty Kind Eodred II, whose wisdom and strength shaped an era, has passed from this world after a sudden and tragic illness. He was a husband, a ruler, and a guiding star in difficult times. May his soul find rest, and may his memory endure in every brick of this great city.*

> *In accordance with royal charter and counsel of the peerage, I, Ileosa Arabasti, Queen of Korvosa, have assumed stewardship of the throne. I do not take this mantle lightly. In this time of uncertainty, I pledge to preserve order, dignity, and the legacy of our shared Crown.*

> *To all good citizens: remain steadfast. Let not rumor darken your hearts, nor agitators stir chais in our streets. Your city stands—guarded, governed, and unbroken. Continue your work, care for your neighbors, and trust your Queen will act in your interest, always.*

> *Glory to Korvosa. Glory to her people. Glory to the Crown.*

## Proclamation, Magistrate Caldrin Ornelos

> *People of Korvosa—stand firm. His Majesty Eodred II passed peacefully under the care of palace apothecarists. There is no cause for alarm. The city’s government remains intact, its walls secure, and its spirit unbroken.*

> *By order of the Magistrate of Civic Harmony, curfews will be lightly enforced in Northpoint and the Midland. Until further notice travel across Northbridge to or from Old Korvosa is prohibited. Until unrest in that quarter ceases and for the sake of order and the safety of all, the Korvosan Guard will prevent any such travel occurring. Travel between other districts may be delayed from brief inspection—cooperate, and you will be treated with courtesy.*

> *Let you grief be tempered by duty. Do not gather in unlawful assembly. The Queen has asked for prayers, not panic.*

## Notice, Field Marshal Cressida Kroft

> *Oyez! Oyez! Loyal citizens—be advised that Queen Ileosa remains within the walls of Castle Korvosa and under the counsel of the Peerage Review. Do not lend ear to whispers of conspiracy, foreign interference, or foul play—these serve only to weaken out unity.*

> *The Guard reminds all Korvosans: the Sable Company remains on active deployment within the city. For your own safety and the safety of all, give them way and let them do their jobs.*

> *Stay your course. Keep your homes. Trust the Guard. Korvosa endures.*
