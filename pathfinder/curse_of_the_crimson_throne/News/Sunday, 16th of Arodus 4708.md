# SAINT ALIKA’S DAY FESTIVAL TO LIGHT THE CITY
Korvosa prepares once more to honor its most beloved martyr, Saint Alika, whose sacrifice saved thousands from the great fire in 4429, not unlike the fires of rebellion that our fair Queen recently guarded us against.

Festivities will begin on the 15th, with a dawn procession starting from the Bank of Abadar and continuing down Sunrise and then on to Harborview where it will culminate in the lighting of the beacon in Eodred’s Circle market. Let the memory of our revered saint’s actions reflect the city’s renewed unity.

# EXECUTION INTERRUPTED: BLACKJACK BETRAYS THE PEOPLE!
Chaos erupted in Jeggare Circle when the public execution of Trinia Sabor, convicted assassin of our late King, was interrupted by the masked criminal known as Blackjack. The condemned woman was whisked from the scaffold in a shocking escape aided by unholy magic and an accomplice dressed in priestly garb.

Eyewitnesses claim the vigilante shouted “to hell with law” before vanishing toward the roofs of Old Korvosa. Despite the best efforts of the Sable Company and the Korvosan Guard, all fugitives remains at large.

Her Majesty expressed both outrage and resolve in a written statement shared with our humble periodical this morning:

> *“The charade has gone on long enough. Let the traitor know that mercy is still within her grasp — should she surrender herself to face the Queen’s justice, her life may yet be spared. The same cannot be promised to those who harbor her.”*

Sister Sabina, Commander of the Gray Maidens has authorized a reward for information leading to the capture of either Blackjack or Trinia Sabor. Citizens are reminded that any who aid fugitives are subject to charges of sedition.

# BRAVERY IN THE FACE OF MADNESS: LOYAL CITIZENS DEFEND THE CROWN
The attempted riot at Jeggare Circle was swiftly quelled thanks to the valor of Korvosa’s loyal citizens and the city’s defenders. Particularly praised was Isabella von Carstein, a one-time cadet at Endrin Academy, whose quick thinking and courage prevented disaster. Despite sustaining injuries, she rallied a faltering squadron and secured the safety of both the Queen and the officer in command, who fell under an assassin’s arrow.

Witnesses describe von Carstein’s actions as “divinely inspired” — a phrase echoed by the Queen herself, who declared:

> *”Loyalty such as hers rekindles my faith in this city’s heart. Korvosa stands because of souls like hers”*

Rumor from the palace whispers that Lady von Carstein will be among the first honored at the forthcoming coronation ceremony.

# HOUSE ARKONA SECURES TRADE DEAL
After weeks of tense negotiation, Glorio Arkona has finalized a renewed trade compact with the Vudrani Confederation, ensuring imports of spices, silks, and rare reagents vital to the city’s artisans and alchemists.

Meliya, sister to the Arkona patriarch, announced that the accord will “stabilize Korvosa’s economy during these trying times" and reaffirm the House’s devotion to Queen and crown.

In exchange, sources within the docks’ labor force suggest several tariffs have been quietly lifted, granting the Arkona fleet favorable docking privileges and exemptions from new excise taxes.

When asked about these rumors, Magistrate of Commerce Garrick Tann smiled and replied, “Every partnership requires compromise. The crown rewards loyalty, and House Arkona has shown it in abundance”

# ACADEMAE AFFAIRS: TROUBLE IN THE TOWER?
The illustrious Academae, long the pride of Korvosa’s arcane learning, faces whispers of discord. Unverified reports from within the collegia allege that several senior professors have been placed on indefinite leave following what sources describe as “philosophical irregularities” in their work.

Headmaster Toff Ornelos has declined formal comment, though a palace aid noted that “…the Crown expect every institution within Korvosa to stand united in this time of change.”

The palace has further announced plans to review the Academae’s charter, citing concerns over “independent magical operations contrary to the welfare of the peace.”

In the meantime, apprentices are encouraged to focus on their studies and avoid “dangerous speculations unbecoming of loyal scholars.”
