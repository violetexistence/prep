# BLACKJACK IS BACK
After six months of no reported sightings, the stygian-masked marvel returned to save a family of four from certain death.

*"It were him, Blackjack, what saved us from them blue demons."*

Mrs. Polliver, 24, reported the encounter to the Guard last night, stating Blackjack rescued her and her three children from wild-haired, blue-skinned gnomes who were attempting to abduct them as they returned home to their apartment in Bridgefront. Mrs. Polliver stated they had gone across the river that day to visit family in Midlands.

Valiant members of the Korvosan Guard descended on the scene to sweep for clues. Unfortunately their bluesome quarry had vanished, no doubt into hiding after they were overmatched by the avenging steel of Blackjack's blade.

Remember to write into the Carrier about any further sightings of Korvosa's true masked hero.

# ROYAL HANGOVER RUINS RECEPTION
Guests at the reception for Lord and Lady Selachii were disappointed when His Majesty King Eodred II cancelled the royal appearance at the ball. Rumors continue to swirl that His Majesty's repeated absences from public appearances are due to his continuing recovery from the massive gala held for the Day of Destiny.

The Seneschal of Castle Korvosa and Palace Apothecariists deny any decline in his health insisting that he is simply taking time away from public events to focus on managing the internal welfare and prosperity of the city. Our readers will remember the massive amounts of wine and beer provided as well as reports of the King leading a great procession in tasting all the offerings before He and Her Majesty Queen Illeosa lead the opening dance of the sprightly Chellish Three Step much to the surprise and delight of all attendees. The King's liveliness and gaiety were remarked upon by many due to His venerable state yet He and the Queen both were still in high spirits when they boarded the royal coach at the end of the festivities that night. In the weeks since though the King has not been seen outside of the palace. Day to day duties of the Crimson Throne are being dispatched by Seneschal Neolandus, but Her Majesty Queen Illeosa has generously shared a few private words of reassurance that Her husband is in high spirits and looks forward to an imminent return to public life.

# A REMINDER FROM THE FIELD MARSHAL
As the Riverwind Festival nears our writers sat down with Field Marshal Cressida Kroft to discuss the safety of Korvosa.

Given the news of turmoil in other, lesser, cities in Varisia-when asked if Korvosa was safe from the anarchy and peril gripping the lands west and north of us she had this to say.

*"Our city is a beautiful, and prosperous [city] and like any other, it draws the attention of criminals. It is an unfortunate thing, but know that the Korvosan Guard stand vigilant and committed to upholding His Majesty's laws and protecting the peace for all [good] citizens. We understand these threats to sacred order and have plans ready to act for every situation."*
