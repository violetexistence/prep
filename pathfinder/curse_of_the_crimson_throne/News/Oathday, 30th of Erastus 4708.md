## KILLER FOUND GUILTY, REGICIDE, TREASON
The swift and expeditious trial of Trinia Sabor, the young painter accused of assassinating King Eodred II, reached its conclusion yesterday. The tribunal delivered a guilty verdict on all charges. Her public beheading is scheduled for next Wealday in the Jeggare Circle. Magistrate Zenderholme urges calm and warns citizens against any unlawful demonstrations of sympathy. “Justice will be done, and order will be preserved,” declared the hanging judge.

## QUAH CRISIS AVERTED BY HEROIC DELVE
What began as a simmering standoff with the Shoanti Moon-Quah threatened to boil into open conflict. Sources confirm that the crisis was resolved only through the daring intervention of local agents who braved the dreaded Dead Warrens. While the Crown has declined to name the adventurers, eyewitnesses describe them as “unlikely heroes who risked all to prevent bloodshed.” The tenuous peace with the Shoanti now holds—though for how long remains uncertain. We here at your loyal and trusted chronicle certainly hope the violence demonstrations which have become commonplace on our streets have finally come to an end.

## HELLKNIGHTS OUT. GRAY MAIDENS IN?
Rumors swirl in every tavern and guard post: with the Order of the Nail departing Korvosa, is Queen Ileosa prepared to fill the vacuum with her newly armed Gray Maidens? Sources close to the Crimson Throne say the this new order has already begun patrolling sections of the city. Supporters tout their discipline and loyalty. Others, wonder if this move signals lack of confidence in the leadership of Field Marshal Kroft, and might be related to the Korvosan Guard’s struggle to maintain the Queen’s peace in recent months.

## OYTUGHS—ARE THEY WORTH IT
Korvosa’s reliance on otyughs for sewer maintenance has once again sparked debate. After recent incidents of the creatures surfacing and attacking citizens, many question whether these monstrous scavengers are a boon or a blight. “They keep the undercity clean,” argue city magistrates. “But what happens when they’re hungry?” counter worried residents. A civic review has been called for—but in the meantime, citizens are advised to “avoid suspicious puddles.”

## SCREAM TO PEN NEW SCRIPT
Art circles buzz with rumors that Korvosa’s most controversial playwright, Salvatore Scream, has begun drafting a new script for performance at Pilts Swastel’s notorious playhouse, Exemplary Execrables. Known for grotesque spectacles that blend satire and blood, Scream’s latest work is whispered to be his boldest yet. No official title has been confirmed, but an anonymous source claims the play will “not just sate your lust for blood and sex… it’s going to inspire a wave of peace and prosperity.”

## SAINT ALIKA WAS BORN

At the close of Arodus, Korvosa will once again honor the life and martyrdom of Saint Alika, beloved throughout Varisia for her compassion and sacrifice during the Age of Enthronement. The temples of Sarenrae, Abadar, and even Pharasma have all announced coordinated services, with candlelight vigils planned in the Heights and Old Korvosa alike.

Merchants along Gold Market prepare for brisk trade in flowers, devotional charms, and sweet cakes traditionally shared among family and neighbors on the day of remembrance. The city watch urges patience with street closures, as celebrants are expected to throng the avenues leading to the Pantheon of Many.

Though some whisper of unease given recent unrest, High Priestess Keppira d’Bear of Pharasma’s temple assures the faithful: “Saint Alika gave her life to preserve the dignity of our people. In honoring her, we affirm that even in times of trial, Korvosa remembers its better nature.”
