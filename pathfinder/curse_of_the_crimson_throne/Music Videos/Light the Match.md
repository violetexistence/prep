##### \[INT. NIGHT — A RAIN SLICK SQUARE IN OLD KORVOSA\]

A small crowd has gathered beneath sagging awnings and cracked balconies. Blackjack stands on a crate under a broken lantern. His mask glints. Rain hits his shoulders. A lute hums low.

---

##### VERSE 1

> **BLACKJACK (singing, low and smoky)**
> *She wore it like armor
> A gift I once saw
> Pinned on by the girl
> Who still followed the law*

##### VISUALS:
- Izzie presses the brooch into **Ileosa’s hand**, their heads bent together in shadows.
- A slow twirl: Ileosa **practicing martial strikes** in a candlelit hall—fluid, sharp, dangerous.

---

> *You showed her the strike
> She showed us the flame
> And I—gods forgive me
> I just played the game*

##### VISUALS:
- **Izzie’s hands guiding Ileosa’s stance**, then stepping back
- A blurred flash: **Ileosa alone in the Overlook ballroom**, moving like she’s still dancing—with a blade.

---

##### PRE-CHORUS

> *You ran to the light
> While I stayed in the shade
> You bled for the truth
> And I let the debt fade*

##### VISUALS
- A secret meeting: the two silhouetted in the rain, heads together.
- Izzie’s (metaphorical) tribunal: the brooch absent, her expression blank, Vesh nowhere to be found.

---

##### CHORUS (FULL BAND CRASHES IN)

> *I lit the match
> Thought I’d take the fall
> But I left you burning
> And she watched it all*

> *We danced on the edge
> To a song we forgot
> You gave me your silence
> And she gave you the rot*

##### VISUALS
- Flames crawl up the walls of Endrin Academy
- Vesh stands in smoke, smirking, then vanishing into shadow.
- Ileosa, brooch now pinned to royal robes, stares down from the Crimson Throne.

---

> *We danced on the edge
> To a song we forgot
> I gave her my silence
> And she left me to rot*

##### VISUALS
- Izzie, on her knees in a riot lit street, brooch in hand.
- A flashback of their fingers brushing as the gift was given.
- Smoke rising. The city howls.

---

##### VERSE 2

> *She smiled like a secret
> Veiled sharp as a blade
> Spoke love like a riddle
> Wore power like jade*

> *You begged me to speak
> But I swallowed the blame
> And when they came for you
> I just whispered your name*

##### VISUALS
- **Ileosa behind the Overlook bar,** pouring drinks, listening to second sons spill secrets.
- **Blackmail letters burned**. A servant girl weeps. **Ileosa watched without blinking**.

---

##### PRE-CHORUS 2

> *I said I’d stand tall
> But I left when it burned
> She rose from the ash
> While your back was turned*

##### VISUALS
- **Vesh**, standing over a fallen cadet, face unreadable.
- **Izzie’s name scratched out** from an Endrin roll call.
- The brooch: cleaned, polished, **worn by Ileosa at court**.

---

##### CHORUS REPEAT

> *I lit the match
> Thought I’d feel control
> But the flame kissed her fingers
> And she swallowed it whole*

> *I watched her rise
> From the smoke and the shame
> Now the girl that you taught
> Only answers to flame*

##### VISUALS
- A wall covered in Harrow Cards, burning.
- Ileosa raising her head as rioters kneel, the brooch gleaming like judgement.
- Izzie’s hand trembling over a dagger, unsure who she’s aiming for.

---

##### BRIDGE (HAUNTED, CONFESSIONAL)

> *I watched as she changed
> As the brooch found her throat
> You gave her truth
> And she carved it in oaths*

> *I should’ve been there
> But I broke when you bled
> Now all I can do…
> is haunt what we said*

##### VISUALS
- The cracked mirror. **Izzie stares at herself**.
- A single candle burns beside the **brooch on a windowsill**.

---

##### VERSE 3

> *The city still sleeps
> While the fire creeps in
> But they crowed her with kindling
> Then blamed her for sin*

##### VISUALS
- **The Crimson Throne burns in a dream**, its sigils warping.
- **Crowds cheer**, unaware of the flames at their backs.

---

##### FINAL CHORUS

> *I lit the match
> Now the throne wears her name
> You bear the scar
> And I bear the shame*

> *The girl that we knew
> Is gone with the smoke
> You loved us both…
> but I cracked when it broke*

##### VISUALS
- Izzie in the washroom, **fingers tracing the deep scar**.
- Ileosa at the Overlook, barefoot on a ruined ballroom floor, **laughing breathlessly as Izzie tosses her a bottle**.
- **Vesh’s eyes**, tear lined but smiling, watching **Ileosa spar with Izzie in the candlelight**.
- **Blackjack disappears into the night**, leaving only smoke and silence.
