## F2. Sick Ward
> The warehouse’s vast interior has been converted into one gigantic convalescent ward. The stench of alcohol, sickness, and waste chokes the breath, and tight rows of low, stained cots cram the stone-floored hall. Every bed is filled with a pitiful story—men and women of all walks groaning and wheezing as they’re consumed by affliction, their sufferings multiplied by the echoing chamber.

## F3. Loading Bay
> The smell here is a mix of damp wood, soap, and boiled grain. The wide floor is worn smooth by heavy traffic, its boards scuffed and stained rather than splintered. Overhead, ropes and pulleys cross the ceiling in a dense web, their knots tidy and well-maintained. A reinforced cargo net hangs near the rafters, holding several sealed barrels marked in chalk with simple symbols rather than words.
> Three massive wooden doors dominate the north wall, their iron bands scarred and patched from years of use. To the south and east, heavy leather flaps hang in place of doors.

## F4. Warehouse Lift
> Several shallow cubbies and narrow wooden lockers line the walls of this modest workroom, each tagged with faded labels—*linens*, *tonics*, *coal*, *bandages*. A scarred table sits in the center of the room, surrounded by mismatched chairs that have clearly hosted many hurried meals and exhausted conversations. The air smells faintly of boiled herbs, soap, and old wood.
> 
> Against the far wall stands a large, well-maintained cargo lift, its platform reinforced with iron brackets and its rails disappearing upward into the ceiling. Though utilitarian, it has been kept in careful repair—clearly relied upon to move patients, supplies, and cots between floors without strain. A small chalkboard nearby lists lift priorities in a tidy hand: *Water*, *Clean Bedding*, *Patients Unable to Walk*.
