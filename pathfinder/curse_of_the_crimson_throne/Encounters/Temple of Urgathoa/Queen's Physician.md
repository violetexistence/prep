**Medical Malpractice** `[one-action]` The surgeon attempts a Medicine check against the Fortitude DC of one living creature they can see within 60 feet. On a success, the surgeon's melee Strikes deal an extra 1d6 precision damage against that creature (2d6 on a critical success) until 1 minute passes or the surgeon critically hits that creature, whichever comes first. Using this action again ends any previous one. A surgeon can target an individual creature no more than once per day with this ability.
