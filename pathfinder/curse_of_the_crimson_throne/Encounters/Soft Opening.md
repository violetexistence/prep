# **✨ Six-Course Tasting Menu of Glassa Rexvult**


# **1. Amuse-Bouche — The Whisper of First Blood**
 

**Presentation:**

A single bite on a black slate tile: a sphere of chilled beet consommé encasing a dab of bright goat cheese, topped with a shard of candied lemon rind.

  

**Flavor Experience:**

Cold → sweet → tangy → metallic echo.

  

**Sensory Hook:**

When the sphere bursts, it _pops_ audibly — a tiny gasp heard across the table.

  

**RP Beat:**

Pilts comments on “the importance of the very first impression,” clearly not talking about the food.

---

# **2. Opening Course — The Maiden’s Echo**

  

A “softer,” publicly acceptable descendant of the infamous _Maiden’s Womb_ dish.

  

**Presentation:**

Three slivers of sweetmeats taken from “untainted stock,” fanned on a plate of rose glass, dusted with pink pepper and edible flower ash.

  

**Flavor:**

Velvety, slightly sweet, unsettling in its innocence.

  

**Sensory Hook:**

A faint perfume of crushed cherry blossoms is released as soon as the plate is lifted.

  

**RP Beat:**

Pilts glances at Scream to see if he reacts; Pilts clearly _expects_ commentary, reverence, or shock.

---

# **3. Soup Course — Broth of the Unborn Sea**

  

**Presentation:**

A translucent bowl over a candle. Inside: a pale, shimmering broth with a single tiny dumpling shaped like an unhatched egg.

  

**Flavor:**

Soft brine → smoke → the lingering warmth of ginger.

  

**Sensory Hook:**

When stirred, the broth refracts light in shifting shapes, like something swimming just beneath.

  

**RP Beat:**

A moment for Meelo to use Society, Crafting, or Perception to identify something about the dish — or subtly impress Pilts.

---

# **4. Main Course — Beast Before the Hunt**

  

**Presentation:**

A lacquered plate featuring a medallion of venison taken from a pre-breeding doe, seared rare, edged with black garlic and a streak of blackberry-blood glaze.

  

**Flavor:**

Savory, primal, deep berry iron.

  

**Sensory Hook:**

Steam rises in a spiral captured by an overhead lantern, making the plate look like a ritual sacrifice on an altar.

  

**RP Beat:**

This is when Pilts becomes physical, animated, fired up — the course when he is most likely to meddle, needle, or test Meelo’s reactions.

---

# **5. Intermezzo — The Cleansing Flame**

  

**Presentation:**

A tiny glass of chilled citrus granita paired with a thimble of pepper-infused cream.

  

**Flavor:**

Acid → frost → slow burn.

  

**Sensory Hook:**

A server spritzes an aromatic mist of charred sage over the table.

  

**RP Beat:**

Good moment for humor, tension-breaking, or a sudden shift in topic — intermezzos are palate resets _and_ social resets.

---

# **6. Dessert — The Cradling Night**

  

**Presentation:**

A black bowl holding a “nest” of spun sugar, within which lies a single dark chocolate truffle filled with warm spiced custard.

  

**Flavor:**

Bitter → sweet → molten vanilla spice → smoky finish.

  

**Sensory Hook:**

When the truffle is cracked, the custard glows faint amber under the lanternlight — unsettlingly womb-like.

  

**RP Beat:**

Final Influence push; a chance for Pilts to become unexpectedly sincere, introspective, or threatening… depending on how the scene is going.

---

# **Bonus: Optional 7th Course — Chef’s Sin**

  

Served only if Pilts is impressed or emotionally affected.

A secret tasting: one spoonful of something he claims “no one else is ready for.”

Can be anything from divine to disturbing — your choice.

  

Great for **rewarding high Influence** or **punishing mockery**.
