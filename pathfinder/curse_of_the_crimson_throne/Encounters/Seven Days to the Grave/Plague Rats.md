A community of ratfolk are in danger of being exterminated or driven out by the people of Korvosa, who on a good day have a hard time differentiating Ysoki from wererats.

Recently, a mob of Midland residents publicly executed a Ysoki they found skulking in an alley. This misguided fear and murder was seen as something of a triumph of citizen action and quickly led to a few drunken dockworkers braving the sewers to “hunt rats”, even going so far as to demand a reward from the government. Used to fear and abuse, most of the ratfolk responded by abandoning their homes and hiding elsewhere in the city. However, a firebrand named Girrigz refuses to do so, instead calling his kin to war against the weakened humans above.

A Ysoki, named Eries is a gifted alchemist who has developed a potent anti-plague which could be used to combat Blood Veil, if only the people and government of Korvosa would listen to her. Unfortunately her appearance and lack of diplomatic experience have meant her petitions at the Ledger have so far come to nothing. In the wake of recent violence it’s extremely dangerous for her to even make an appearance in public. So, she turned to magic. Seeking a potion to change her appearance, she discovered she didn’t have enough coin to purchase one. Seeking an artist to create a disguise, she discovered she lacked the confidence to pull off an act. She prayed to the gods she knew for a miracle, but they did not seem to hear her. 

As despair set in, an answer came in the form a Nidalese ship, sailing unmanned into the harbor and quickly sunk by trebuchet fire. Aboard this ship was a sea hag with both the means and the motive to answer Eries prayer. Yvicca, a friend of Lady Andaisin, secretly boarded the ship and hid in its hold as it sailed into Conqueror’s Bay. When it sunk, she watched as its only crewman, the young cultist Rois, struggled in his attempt to escape and ultimately drown. Then, she crept from the depths in the dark to survey her new hunting grounds. As fate would have it, she came upon a very sad and very needy Eries dangling her feet in the river.

The deal she offered was simple. An attractive human body, sure to open doors for her in Korvosa, in return for her knowledge of alchemy. Eries was worried — how could she help anyone without the ability to brew more potions. Yvicca convinced her that knowledge could always be relearned with time and besides, didn’t she already possess a sizable supply of the potions she needed? The truth is, that Eries had always wanted to be accepted in the city. She longed to walk among the humans and see their smiles of admiration and joy directed at her. She accepted.

Everything was suddenly different. This time, when she made her way up the steps of the Ledger, everyone was happy to see her. They smiled and opened doors. The magistrates greeted her with courtesy and showed interest in the things she said. When she offered to help with the outbreak, they listened.

Eries was deputized by the Magistrate of Public Health and quickly began negotiations with the ratfolk burrow of Bridgefront. With her understanding of the burrow’s concerns and how the ratfolk of her community think, she was able to persuade them to come to the table. With her new form, the bureaucrats in the Korvosan government were open to suggestion.
