# Smoldering Tension
## Hazard 1

---

==environmental==

**Stealth** +0
**Description** Korvosa seethes quietly. Protestors gather. Guards shift uneasily at their posts. Whispers of rebellion echo in the alleyways, but for now, the city holds its breath.  

---  

**Disable** This hazard cannot be permanently disabled by skill checks or magic. Its effects can be mitigated through daily **downtime activities** that generate pooled **Survival Tokens** (see Table 1-1).  

---

**Survival Threshold** The city still meets basic needs. No Survival Tokens are required. However, if **any character is Marked** (Rebel, Usurper, or Looter), they must attempt a **DC 15 Will save** at the start of each day to resist stress and suspicion.

---

**Survival Strain** `[reaction]` **Trigger** A marked character begins a day in Korvosa. **Effect** The stress and suspicion of an uncertain fate weigh heavy. The character must attempt a **DC 15 Will** save.
	**Success**: No effect.
	**Failure**: The character is **Frightened 1**.
	**Criticla Failure** The character is **Frightened 1** and loses **1 Hope**

---

**Reset** Every 24 hours.

# Open Dissent
## Hazard 2

---

==environmental==

**Stealth** +0
**Description** Korvosa staggers beneath the weight of grief, fury, and fear. The king is dead. The Guard is fractured. Temples have shuttered their doors to strangers. Gangs clash in alleyways while nobles bicker behind warded gates. Everyone wants something—bread, blood, and, most of all, *someone to blame*.  

---  

**Disable** This hazard cannot be permanently disabled by skill checks or magic. Its effects can be mitigated through daily **downtime activities** that generate pooled **Survival Tokens** (see Table 1-1).  

---

**Survival Threshold** At the end of each day, the party must collectively provide the number of **Survival Tokens** listed in Table 1-1 based on party size. If the party fails to meet this threshold, the hazard’s **Survival Strain** reaction triggers for each character. Once per day, **1 Hope token** may be substituted for any other token type.

---

**Survival Strain** `[reaction]` **Trigger** A character begins a day without having met their basic needs (see Table 1-1). **Effect** The city's neglect takes hold—empty bellies, fear, and untreated wounds gnaw at resolve. The character must attempt a **DC 16 Fortitude** save.
	**Success**: No effect.
	**Failure**: The character becomes **Fatigued**.
	**Critical Failure**: The character becomes **Fatigued** and **Frightened 1**. This frightened condition is removed after 24 hours, after receiving meaningful comfort or a special meal, or at the end of the character’s first turn in combat—whichever comes first.

---

**Reset** Every 24 hours.

# Crisis of Control
## Hazard 3

---

If the party fails to meet this threshold, the hazard’s **Survival Strain** reaction triggers for each character. Once per day, **1 Hope token** may be substituted for any other token type.
	In addition, unmarked characters trigger Survival Strain, even if the party meets their basic needs.

---

**Survival Strain** `[reaction]` **Trigger** A character begins a day without having met their basic needs (see Table 1-1) or is unmarked. **Effect** The city's neglect takes hold—empty bellies, fear, and untreated wounds gnaw at resolve. The character must attempt a **DC 17 Fortitude** save.
	**Success**: No effect.

	**Critical Failure**: The character becomes **Fatigued** and **Wounded 1**.

# Blood in the Streets
## Hazard 4

---

==environmental==

**Stealth** +0

## Survival Tokens

### Food
These tokens represent the ability to maintain physical energy, hydration, and basic functionality. It’s not just calories—it’s continuity, routine, and the act of feeding others or being fed.

* Clean Water to Drink
* Clothes, shoes

### Shelter
These tokens represent physical security, privacy, and the psychological effect of knowing you’re not exposed. It might not be comfortable—but it’s somewhere you can sleep without fear. 

* Barricaded room, rooftop, or sewer alcove.
* Mutual agreement with a local gang or law enforcement.
* Cleaning or adding amenities to your space—anything that makes it more comfortable or cozy.
* Warding, sanctifying a site to ward off intruders.

### Medicine
These tokens represent medical attention, sanitation, and emotional stabilization. It doesn’t require a healer’s touch—sometimes it’s being checked on, having your wound bound, or knowing someone cares if you live or die.

* Trained medical caregivers.
* First aid supplies, drugs, palliatives.
* Cleaning supplies
* Clean Water for Washing

### Hope
These tokens represent something broader than morale—it’s meaning, connection, and witnessing something unbroken.

* Witnessing someone survive because of your actions.
* Forgiving a wrong, being forgiven.
* Preserving art, music, or memory.
* Remembering who you are—your name, your oath, your story.
* Building something that wasn’t there before.

## City in Turmoil
As your characters progress through the various events unfolding, Survival Tokens can be used to represent the gratitude and patronage of the Queen, rebel factions, the Guard, etc.
## Downtime Activities
Assume the main way your characters can get Survival Tokens is using downtime actions. Each day, each player should choose a downtime activity for their character. It is then imagined their character is engaging in that activity off screen, while not participating in the events. In the fiction, characters might be collaborating on downtime activities, but their actions are resolved individually. Survival Tokens earned are pooled for the whole party. All other benefits and consequences resulting from these downtime activities is borne by the character taking the action.
## Order of Operations
1. Enter Downtime Mode
2. Each player chooses a downtime activity for their character to take.
3. Resolve the activities in order of…
	1. Enlist
	2. Subsist
	3. Rest
	4. Background
## Unrest Levels
Old Korvosa
North Point
Midland
Heights
East Shore
South Shore

```pf2e-stats
# Smash, Grab, Run `[one-action]`

	**Critical Success**: You may choose to avoid either taking damage or being **marked as a looter**.
	**Success**: Take 1d6 damage and become **marked as a looter**.

	- Gain **Wounded 1**.
	- Lose any **Hope** you currently have.
	**Critical Failure**: As failure, but choose two.
```

```


```pf2e-stats
# Barricade and Breathe `[one-action]`
---
==downtime== ==rest==
You find a defensible spot: a shuttered shop, a storm drain, or upper floor, and fortify it. Nails, boards, maybe a holy symbol on the door. Hope no one knocks. Attempt a **DC 16 Arcana**, **Crafting**, or **Survival** check. Alternatively, attempt a **DC 14 Lore** (Architecture, Carpentry, Labor) check.
	**Critical Success** Take **3 Shelter** tokens.
	**Success** Take **2 Shelter** tokens.
	**Failure** The spot you found is unstable or compromised. You gain your 2 tokens as success, but any **unspent Shelter** tokens are lost at the start of the day.

If you are willing to hurt people to keep what you have, keep your **unspent Food** and **Medicine** tokens, but all characters in the party take 1d6 damage and you lose 1 **Hope** token.
```

```pf2e-stats
# Spark the Uprising `[one-action]`
---
==downtime== ==enlist== ==rebel==
**Requires** You cannot be marked as a usurper.

You help in the shadows: slipping food to saboteurs, treating the injured, tipping off gangs about patrol routes. You're not carrying a torch--but you're striking the match. Attempt a DC 16 Deception, Medicine, or Stealth check. Alternatively, attempt a DC 14 Lore (Heraldry, Scouting, Underworld) check.
	**Critical Success** Same as success and choose one:

```pf2e-stats
# Carry the Flame `[one-action]`
---
==downtime== ==enlist== ==rebel==

```

```pf2e-stats
# Restore Law and Order `[one-action]`
---
==downtime== ==enlist== ==usurper==
**Requires** You cannot be marked as a rebel.

You reinforce Guard posts, ferry the wounded, or help drive back mobs from key streets. They're outnumbered and fraying at the seams, but if you wear the red, they might just shield you in return. For now. Attempt a **DC 16 Athletics**, **Intimidation**, or **Medicine** check. Alternatively, attempt a **DC 14 Lore** (**Heraldry**, **Scouting**, **Warfare**) check.
	**Critical Success** Same as success and choose one:
	- Take 1 additional Food, Shelter, or Medicine token, 3 total.
	- You avoid being marked as a usurper.
	- Erase a mark other than ursurper.
	**Success** Your loyalty is remembered gratefully. Take 2 tokens, choosing Food, Shelter, or Medicine for each. You are marked as a ursurper.
	**Failure** Your loyalty is accepted but there is no gratitude. As success but take only 1 token instead of 2.
	**Critical Failure** The Guard turns on you, suspecting infiltration or subversion. You're detailed, threatened, and beaten; take 1d6 damage. You are marked as both a rebel and a usurper.
```

```pf2e-stats
# Defend the Crown `[one-action]`
---
==downtime== ==enlist== ==usurper==
**Requires** Being marked as a usurper. You cannot be marked as a rebel.

The Guard may not know who to trust anymore--but you've proven you're not among the wolves. Now you walk beside them, hold the line, and carry out orders that aren't printed anywhere.
Take **1 Food**, **Shelter**, or **Medicine** token.
```

```pf2e-stats
# Verdant Sanctuary `[three-actions]`
---
==downtime== ==background==
**Requires** Member of the Verdant community.
You find shelter in the enclave hidden behind shuttered stone walls and rustling ivy. The Verdant offers you peace and protection--but even this haven bears the weight of the city's collapse.
Your basic needs and those of anyone with you are met today. Take 1 **Food**, 1 **Medicine**, and 1 **Hope** token.

**Limit** This activity can only be used once.
```

```pf2e-stats
# Paths Only I Know `[three-actions]`
---
==downtime== ==background==
**Requires** Trained or better in Lore (Shingles).  
The rooftops and ledges of Old Korvosa bend around your footsteps. You know which plank walks and doorways still hold—and which ones feed blood to the gutter. This city hates you, but it hasn't caught you yet.  
Your basic needs and those of anyone with you are met today. Take 1 **Shelter** token and **remove any one mark** you have (**Looter**, **Rebel**, or **Usurper**).

**Limit** This activity can only be used once.
```

```pf2e-stats
# 'Neath the Dawnflower `[three-actions]`
---
==downtime== ==background==
**Requires** Priestess or lay cleric of Sarenrae.  
The temple is doing everything it can to help staunch the bleeding wounds of the city. All are welcome who come in need and in good faith—but showing **your** face here cuts both ways. There are so many in need. Stay too long, and be consumed by it.  
Your basic needs and those of anyone with you are met today. Take 1 **Shelter** token and 2 **Medicine** tokens.

**Limit** This activity can only be used once.
```

```pf2e-stats
# Unwelcome Doorways `[three-actions]`
---
==downtime== ==background==
**Requires** Noble background or past association.  
You call on the scraps of your past—titles you no longer claim, bloodlines that no longer speak your name, and debts too old to collect. But the old names still carry weight. And danger.  
Your basic needs and those of anyone with you are met today. Take 2 tokens, choosing **Food**, **Shelter**, or **Medicine** for each.

**Limit** This activity can only be used once.
```
Idea: 2 new activities that are essentially riskier versions of For Law and Order and Overthrow the Usurper, which mark characters. Then, make the existing ones less risky but restrict them to those with the mark aligned with their respective factions.
