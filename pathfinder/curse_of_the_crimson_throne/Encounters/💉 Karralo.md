## The “Nice Guy” Turned Facilitator

**Corruption Archetype**: _The Enabler_
**What He Tells Verik**: “I’m just following orders. You’re the one with the vision. I’m here to help.”

Karralo doesn’t _like_ violence, but he’s too weak to resist it and profits from staying close to power. He cleans up the bodies, books the contracts, and soothes Verik’s conscience. He’s the kind of person who _needs_ a more charismatic monster to follow, and now that Verik’s idealism is failing, he’s quietly aligning with **Parns** and **Baldrago** behind the scenes.
