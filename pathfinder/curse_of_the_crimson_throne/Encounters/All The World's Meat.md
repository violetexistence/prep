[[Verik Vancaskerkin]], [[Korvosan Guard]], originally from [[Riddleport]] turned criminal/revolutionary.
[[Orik Vancaskerkin]], older brother to Verik, strong role model, disappeared from [[Riddleport]] after fleeing a scandal.
[[Meliya Arkona]], a [[Vudra|Vudrani]] guise used to manipulate Verik and the poor living in [[Old Korvosa]].
[[Vimanda]], one of the leaders of [[House Arkona]]—actually a rakshasa—attempting to wrest control away from [[House Arabasti]].
[[Baldrago]], grifter with a badge, shakedown artist, bushy eyebrows, large flat nose.
[[Malder]], burned out bigot, wheezing mess, armor barely fits his ample frame.
[[Parns]], career sadist, joined the Guard for licensed violence, broad shoulders, long sideburns
[[Karralo]], the nice guy, enables the others, has a shiver addiction, thin and jittery.

The previous owner of All the World’s Meat was arrested for tax evasion and soon thereafter dies in prison. His shop remained in escrow with the government for nearly a year, boarded over and empty until Vancaskerkin moved in. Verik has taken to sleeping in the small upstairs office. His four accomplices spend most of their time here as well, sleeping wherever they can find someplace comfortable.

The shop is located at 22 Stirge Street.

## Asking Around
Should the PCs ask around on the street about Verik and his gang, they should attempt a DC 15 Diplomacy, Society, or Survival check to gather information. Alternatively they can attempt a DC 13 Lore (Butchery, Mercantile, Underworld) check to recall knowledge about current events involving the shop. They learn the information associated with the check result and all information for check results below it.
- **Critical Success** If one wishes to purchase these additional services, one must simply ask about “the night’s special cuts.”
- **Success** It is known that the Cow Hammer Boys also take jobs for reasonable rates as muscle to take care of problems that require a more diplomatic approach. The previous owner of the butcher shop was in fact arrested and died in prison. The new owners were able to acquire the property from the city for cheap.
- **Failure** All the World’s Meats is being run by five heroes the community has affectionately dubbed The Cow Hammer Boys. A group of workers at the Ironworks took up a collection and helped them purchase the butcher shop from the previous owner. Half of all their profits go back to the workers.
- **Critical Failure** Free meat is being given out of a butcher shop in Old Dock—All the World’s Meats—to community members in need during the time of unrest. This is keeping many families from going hungry.

> [!NOTE] ==B1== Shop Front (CR 1)
> A sign bearing the image of a fat, smiling cow hangs above the entrance to the butcher shop. Inside, a long counter runs over half the room’s perimeter, beyond which a door stands ajar. A marble topped table displays cuts of meat before a wide, grimy window. A few flies circle in the air above the meat. A series of bookshelves are aligned with the east wall, featuring a prodigious variety of sauces and rubs, each with a more threatening label than the last.

This room is where Verik’s thugs hand out fresh meat to locals in search of food. The meat on display in the window is replaced daily, but by the end of the day the flies are present in force. This doesn’t dissuade the ex-guards from handing out these aged cuts to the day’s last customers, of course.

Traffic in and out of the building is heavy for the first hours of the day, as locals arrive in large numbers for free meat. Stragglers wnader by now and then throughout the rest of the day, but the free meat goes fast and most of those arrive after noon leave empty-handed. Once the sun sets, the doors into areas B1 and B6 are locked, but lights burn in the windows of areas B4 and B7 for several hours before going out. Livestock (usually skittish looking cattle or pigs) is brought into the pen (area B6) every morning just before the shop opens. The animals are butchered after dark and the meat is stored in area B3. Based on the number of animals that pass through the pen, a PC who succeeds at a DC 25 Perception check or a DC 15 Profession (butcher) check confirms that there is an unexpectedly large amount of meat coming back out.

The butcher’s shop is staffed by four self-important ex-guards who are more impressed with Verik’s rebellious nature than the concept of feeing hungry locals. They enjoy the power of deciding which families eat at night. They’ve been talking among themselves about methods to use their newfound power to get rich, though they haven’t quite decided yet if they’re going to let Verik in on their plan. During the day, one guard stands at the entrance to the building, one staffs the shop front and hands out meat, and the other two handle the actual preparation of the meat in area B4 or tend to whatever animals they’ve got in the pen.

Two guards stand at attention here: Baldrago (a tall man with bushy eyebrows that merge into one just above his large, flat nose) and Malder (a wheezy man whose chainmail doesn’t quite fit his ample frame). Unless the PCs are disguised as down-on-their-luck locals, both guards have little interest in handing out meat to them and gruffly ask them to “kick off.” Mentioning the “night’s special cuts” brings an immediate end to their hostility, and Malder nods to Baldrago, who closes the front door to allow a little privacy. The Cow Hammer Boys hire themselves out as muscle—they ask no questions of those who hire them, only demanding a payment of 50 gold sails per person to be targeted. Although the guards never openly admit that those they beat are almost always killed, they certainly imply that fact by offering guarantees that after they visit the mark, their client need never worry about the victim again. What they never allude to at all is how they dispose of the bodies.

At no time do the Cow Hammer Boys let anyone up to talk to Verik. The reason for this is simple—Verik doesn’t know about the renegade guards’ side business as hired muscle, and they worry that if he found out how they’ve been getting rid of the bodies, he’d do the same to them. If anyone attempts to push through them into the back room (or if anyone blatantly refuses to leave the shop after being old to do so), both Baldrago and Malder raise their longbows and call out to area B4 for help. They don’t attack first unless a PC successfully makes it further into the building. If a fight breaks out, the Cow Hammer Boys open with shots from their longbows, switching to melee only if their enemies close to do the same. A Cow Hammer Boy reduced to 4 or fewer hit points attempts to flee into the city, and if at least two are killed, the other abandon Verik and flee as soon as they see proof of the other two’s deaths.

> [!NOTE] ==B3== Meat Locker
> The air in this room is stale, stinking of day-old meat and blood. Straw litters the floor, scattered to catch the drips from the meat as it hangs. Meat hooks are affixed to the walls and ceiling on metal rods. To the north is a low blood-stained table and two barrels of salt, while double doors stand in the wall to the south. An iron bar extends through a narrow hole at the top of the doors; the bar runs along the ceiling for five feet before ending at a vertical pole running floor to ceiling.

Meat butchered in the early evening is salted and then stored overnight in this room; by noon it’s all gone. If the PCs enter this room while meat is being stored., the majority of it consists of pork and beef, but at least a half-dozen cuts are harder to identify. A closer examination and a successful DC 20 Medicine, Nature, or Lore (Farming) check reveals that these cuts don’t come from animals at all, but from humanoids.

> [!NOTE] ==B4== Killing Floor (CR 1 and 4)
> The floor of this grim chamber is strewn with blood-stained straw and the reek of slaughter is almost overpowering. The room is a killing floor. Meat hooks dangle from a metal track affixed to the ceiling that allows the hooks and their gory loads to be moved easily around the room. In the northwest corner, a large hammer sits on the floor amid a permanent bloodstain. To the south, a bloodstained grill covers a wide hole in the floor. Just north of the grill sit two large vats of water, one boiling and one cold. Two large butcher blocks stand to the east next to barrels of salt, and in the southeast corner sits a reeking vat of cast-off meat and bones.

This is where the Cow Hammer Boys slaughter animals (and victims of their under-the-counter wetwork), preparing them to be the next day’s handouts. Animals are killed in the northwest corner of the room after being led in from the holding pens, then hung from hooks and hauled along the track over to the grate to be bled and skinned. The blood and the majority of the entrails are allowed to slop through the grate into the pit below. Once the animal is prepared, it is soaked in the boiling water and then the cool water to clean the carcass and slow decay, and is then hauled over to the blocks to be butchered.

The rusty grating in the southwest corner can be bashed through or pried up out of the ground () to allow access between the filthy tunnel below and area B4. The area below is a disused sewer tunnel that runs due east into the river, although the tunnel narrows down to a 4-foot wide, mostly flooded passageway for much of that length. The Cow Hammer Boys dispose of the grisly leftovers through this grating, but anyone who drops into the tunnel below finds the half-flooded chamber to be relatively clean of debris—thanks to the scavengers who dwell there (see Creatures).

#### Creatures
During the day, there’s a 75% chance of encountering the remaining two Cow Hammer Boys here. Parns, a broad shouldered man with long sideburns, worked as a butcher before joining the Guard and meeting Verik; his skills made him the key recruit to Verik’s plan. Parns welcomed the opportunity since the Korvosan Guard simply wasn’t as exciting a job as he’d hoped. Now his job as a butcher and mercenary provides a perfect outlet for his sadism. The other man found here is Karralo, a thin and jittery man with a sallow complexion. Of the four renegades, Karralo is the most unsure—he doesn’t mind beating up folk for money, but butchering them to dispose of the evidence has made him increasingly nervous.

If Parns and Karralo aren’t here during the day, they’re instead in area B5 or B6 tending to the day’s livestock. For several hours after sunset, the two are busy butchering animals in here. When victims of their mercenary work arrive, the unfortunates are smuggled into this room already unconscious or dead and wrapped in sacks. Parns particularly enjoys butchering humans, but Karralo has increasingly begged off this duty. Such grisly work typically takes place after midnight, but doesn’t occur every day—usually the renegades “process” three or four victims a week in this manner.

Characters who choose to investigate the sewer tunnel below are quickly attacked by the three reefclaws that have moved in. The spiny aberrations are the only reason the room hasn’t overflowed and the drainage hasn’t clogged, but even then, the monsters are barely keeping up with the grisly offerings. Well-fed, the creatures attack only if they think intruders are attempting to steal their food—by searching through the remains.

#### Treasure
A successful **DC 16 Perception** check in the sewer below results in a disturbing discovery: a human finger wedged in a crack between two stones just above the waterline. The reefclaws haven’t yet gotten to the finger, which still wears a mithril ring set with tiny slivers of obsidian. The ring is worth 500 gp.
