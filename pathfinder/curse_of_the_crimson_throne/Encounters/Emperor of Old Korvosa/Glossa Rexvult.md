- The Talent
- Former Steward of House Arkona
- Dismissed for making a dish called the Maiden’s Womb, which Ileosa took to be a pointed reference to her and pressured the Arkonas to run him out of their house.
- The idea for this dish was incepted by Mastermind to bring him down and make him “gettable”.

Olauren Carowyn, ambitious female human socialite
Was never able to get an invite to House Arkona when Creme was creating his masterpieces there. This is the kind of rare opportunity that she is normally excluded from by the old blood in Korvosa (such as Baroness von Carstein).
She is hoping to talk Swastel into sending one of his up and coming vocal talents, Ruan Mirukova, to Carowyn manor where he can get a little recognition, perhaps even move up to being a performer at Marbledome.
