## The Grifter with a Badge
**Corruption Archetype**: _The Shakedown Artist_

**What He Tells Verik**: “The system’s broken. I’m just making it work for us now.”

Baldrago sees everything through the lens of **extortion and leverage**. He uses his Guard authority to extract bribes, muscle out rivals, and enrich himself. He _claims_ to support Verik, but secretly uses the Cow Hammer Boys’ reputation to build a **criminal fiefdom**. He’s keeping ledgers, planning an exit, and possibly already made contact with the **Cerulean Society**.
