- **Searching:** secret passage to [[#D3. Dero Cave]]

## D5. Exsanguination Chamber
> *Three wooden tables dominate the center of the room, their surfaces dark and tacky with old stains. Against the easter wall squats a wide hutch, its wicker doors rattling softly as something within stirs against the straw. The air is heavy with a metallic tang, undercut by the faint restless buzzing of wings. **(undetected)** A hunched figure works over a prone body on one of the tables, its hands moving with quick, precise motions. **(alerted)** A body lies on one of the tables, its arms hanging limp over the edge. Several small, hunched shapes cling to its torso, pulsing faintly in a slow unsettling rhythm.*

- hutch → 2x hungry [[Bloodseeker|bloodseekers]]

* **Rolth’s Edict** A character that studied the writing in area [[#D10. Library]] and they can express of of the underlying edicts or anathema therein, they can attempt the claim necrophidius action.
```pf2e-stats
**Claim Necrophidius** `[two-actions]` (uncommon, enchantment, concentrate, occult, visual) **Requirements** You can express the edict used to create the necrophidius. **Effect** You perform a ritual dance which may result in command over the necrophidius. If the target is controlled by Rolth and he is within sight, he attempts a Will saving throw to retain control; otherwise, the target must attempt a Will save.

<div style="height: 1em"></div>

	**Critical Success** The necrophidius is unaffected.
	**Success** The necrophidius is stunned 1 and confused for 1 round as it fights off your commands.
	**Failure** The necrophidius becomes controlled by you and follows your orders. It (or Rolth if he is within sight) can attempt a new Will save at the end of each of its turns; on a success, the spell ends, and the creature becomes stunned 1 and confused for 1 round. If you issue an obviously self-destructive order, the target doesn't act until you issue a new order.
	Critical Failure As failure, but the necrophidius (or Rolth) receives a new save only if you give it a new order that is against its edict.
```

## D7. Alchemy Lab
> Wooden tables crowd the center of the chamber, scattered with glassware. Multiple heavy cauldrons line the eastern wall–one lying on its side. The air is thick with layered scents: bitter herbs, acrid metal, and something cloyingly sweet. **(undetected)** A crouched figure works at the base of the south table.

- boarded up → DC 23 Athletics to Force Open → [[Rolth's Carrion Golem]] attacks with a severed arm clutched in one hand → Gaekhen’s left arm

> This room, once a pantry, is in shambles. Broken crates and shelves lie strewn about the place, with the foodstuffs, firewood, and other supplies they once contained scattered across the floor.


## D9. Prisoner Pits
> This foul-smelling cavern is bordered on three sides by ten-foot-deep pits. From these pits wafts the rancid smell of excrement and decay. Each pit contains a few heaps of moldy straw, a wooden trough containing filthy water, a few rotting body parts, and a couple of still-living prisoners.

- **Creature** [[Cabbagehead]] (unfriendly)→ thinks of Rolth as his father → job is care and feeding of the prisoners

> *There was a time when flesh, breath, and blood,
> The body, and every common form,
> To me did seem
> Appareled in immortal light,
> The glory and the freshness of a dream.
> It is not now as it hath been before;—
> Turn whereso’er I may,
> By night or day,
> The life I have seen, I now must make anew*

> *What is love but a creature half-formed, waiting to be perfected?
> A sickness.
> It brings no lasting joy–only longing, confusion, 
> and the exquisite ache of what is lost.
> And such things beg to be… corrected.*

> *My mother taught me many things.
> Among the most enduring is that one must always have Shelyn at hand.*

> *We do not live only in the flesh that bind us.
> We must pursue the imperishable, or why trouble to draw breath at all?*

> *True evil is, above all, seductive.
> When death knocks at your door, she wears no shroud.
> She comes clothed in the memory of your heart’s desire,
> whispering of one last kiss,
> and beckoning you to follow into her cold embrace.*

## D11. Stitchery
> The nauseating mixture of decay and strange chemicals fills the air of this large room. Glinting saws, pliers, long stitching needles, and other surgical equipment are organized on shelves and benches along the walls. A sturdy wooden table in the center of the room supports a large humanoid shape—a thing stitched together from a patchwork of dozens of different bodies. The thing would stand nearly seven feet tall if it rose.

## D13. Vreeg’s Chamber
> This dry, well-kept chamber contains a narrow bed, a relatively empty shelf holding only a few books and some bones and skulls, and a long bench. A man’s torso, the chest bearing numerous tribal tattoos, lies on this bench. The right arm is still attacked, and periodically thrashes and clutches at the air as if it were alive.
