**Stench** (aura, olfactory) 40 feet. A creature entering the aura or starting its turn in the aura must succeed at a DC 19 Fortitude save or become sickened 1 (plus slowed 1 for as long as it's sickened on a critical failure). While within the aura, affected creatures take a -2 circumstance penalty to saves against disease and to recover from the sickened condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune for 1 minute.

**Vulnerable to Gentle Repose Casting** a gentle repose spell on a carrion golem causes it to grow stiff. The golem attempts a DC 19 Fortitude save. It's unaffected on a critical success, slowed 1 for 1d4 rounds on a success, and on a failure is immobilized and slowed for 1d4 rounds.

**Carrion Golem Components** The decaying body parts that make up a carrion golem are of little value in most cultures. However, the magic used to preserve them and infuse them with disease can still be harnessed by unscrupulous necromancers and other practitioners of foul arts. Such cretures may be willing to purchase a destroyed carrion golem, but the process used to extract the power within the pieces are difficult and inefficient, so they won't pay much.
