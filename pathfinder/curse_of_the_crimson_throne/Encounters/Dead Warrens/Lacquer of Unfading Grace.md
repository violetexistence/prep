# Lacquer of Unfading Grace
## Item 5
==alchemical== ==conumable== ==elixir== ==necromancy==

**Price** 50 gp

**Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** L

This shimmering liquid is Rolth Lamm's masterpiece of desecracted artistry, a warped echo of Shelyn's edict to see beauty in all things. The lacquer clings like resin, suffesed with emblaming herbs and a faint perfume that hides the stench of death.

---

**Effect (Dead)** When poured over a corpse, the lacquer halts decay and restores the body's appearance as thought it were alive. For 24 hours, the corpse looks supple, warm, and whole, regardless of mutilation or decomposition. A preserved body may be presented as if alive, hidden from casual inspection, or kepy pristine for resurrection rituals. Details marred or missing are "reimagined", returning in idealized form according to aesthetics of perfection common to Korvosan citizens of Rolth's time.

**Effect (Living)** When carefully painted onto a living creature's skin, the lacquer reshapes their fetures into a flawless, idealized version of themselves. The subject gains a +1 item bonus to Deception and Diplomacy checks when Making an Impression or Performing. The effect lasts for 1 hour. When it fades, the subject is left with a lingering sense of loss and imperfection

---

**Crafting Requirements** a piece of Shelyn's imagery, marred or defaced, must be destroyed during the crafting process; a drop the imbibers blood added to finish each draught.
