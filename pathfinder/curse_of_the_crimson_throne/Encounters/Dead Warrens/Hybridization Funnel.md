# Hybridization Funnel
## Item 7
Hands 2; Bulk 1

---

This glass and metal apparatus has two angled necks leading into a narrow central chamber, fitted with swirling copper coils and a corked spout. A faint shimmer clings to the inner surface.

**Combine Elixirs** 10 minutes (concentrate) **Frequency** Once per day. **Requirements** You are capable of using the Crafting skill to create alchemical items. **Effect** You pour two elixirs that have the same alchemical type and have the same or adjacent item levels into the funnel. The result is a single hybrid elixir that combines the effects of both.

	When consumed, the hybrid elixir applies both effects simultaneously. If both elixirs heal or damage the same creature, combine the numerical effects (e.g. two lesser elixirs of life heal the combined amount.) If the elixirs have conflicting effects the hybridization fails and both are ruined.

	The hybrid elixir remains stable for 1 hour. After this time, it separates into its components spoiling both.
