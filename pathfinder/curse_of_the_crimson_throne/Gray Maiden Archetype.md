# Gray Maiden Dedication
## Feat 2
---
==uncommon== ==archetype== ==dedication==

**Archetype** Gray Maiden

**Prerequisites** trained in heavy armor; trained in intimidation 

**Access** You are from Korvosa and femme.

---

After passing the Queen's personal examination for strength and beauty, and then enduring a grueling initiation process, you were inducted into a military sisterhood loyal only to her.

**Conditioned** You are the product of indoctrination, repetition, and trauma-bound loyalty. Your psyche is rigidly fortified—enshrining the code of the sisterhood. The parts you consciously remember are listed below. There is at least one secret edict or anathema.
	**Edicts**
	- Serve the Queen's will without question or hesitation.
	- Obey the orders of sisters superior.
	**Anathema** 
	- Acting in ways that distinguish you from your sisters.
	- Undermine the cohesion of the sisterhood.

	**Effect** While conditioned, you gain the following benefits and flaws.
	- You **become trained in Will saves**; if you were already trained, you **become an expert** instead.
	- When you attempt to act against the code, you must attempt a **DC 5 flat check** to complete the action. Failure means you hesitate (lose the action). You can try again on your next turn. 
	- You do not dream.

**Tactics** In addition, you become trained in Warfare Lore; if you were already trained, you become an expert instead.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Gray Maiden archetype.

# Her Will, Your Hands `[reaction]`
## Feat 4
---
==archetype==

**Archetype** Gray Maiden

**Prerequisites** Gray Maiden Dedication; Conditioned

---

Her voice echoes through your memories, creating new meaning. Her will is certainty. Her orders are clarity in chaos. You gain a **+1 status bonus to Will saves** against any **emotional, fear, or mental effect** that would cause you to violate the code of the sisterhood. If you fail the save, you may attempt a new Will save against the effect as a reaction. You can attempt this new save only once for a given effect, even if you are compelled to violate your edict multiple times.

# Reactive Shield `[reaction]`
## Feat 4
---
==fighter==

**Requirements** You are wielding a shield

*This version of the Reactive Shield feat is intended for use with an Archetype and has a different level for access the the original feat.

---

You can snap your shield into place just as you would take a blow, avoiding the hit at the last second. You immediately use the Raise a Shield action and gain your shield's bonus to AC. The circumstance bonus from the shield applies to your AC when you're determining the outcome of the triggering attack.

## Feat 6
---
==archetype==

**Archetype** Gray Maiden

**Prerequisites** Gray Maiden Dedication; trained in Athletics

---

You are the tip of the spear, breaking the enemy’s line with relentless precision and force. Stride up to your Speed, attempting to move through one or more enemies' spaces during this movement. Attempt an **Athletics check** and compare the result to the **Will DC** of each creature whose space you attempt to enter.  
- **Success** you move through that creature’s space.  
- **Failure** your movement **ends before entering their space**.  

After your movement ends, you make a melee **Strike** against a target within reach (regardless of whether you moved through any creatures or not).

# Ashes of Obedience
## Feat 8
---
==archetype==

**Archetype** Gray Maiden

**Prerequisites** Gray Maiden Dedication; Conditioned

---

The mask doesn't fit quite like it used to. You've started dreaming again. Once per day, after failing a Will save, you may choose to critically succeed instead--but you take 2d6 mental damage and become Enfeebled 1 or Drained 1 (your choice). You gain a **+1 status bonus to Perception** checks to detect lies or manipulation.

# Fracture
## Feat 10
---
==archetype==

**Archetype** Gray Maiden

**Prerequisites** Ashes of Obedience

---

You burn the oath. You shatter the mask. You feel every wound. And yet you stand. You are henceforth no longer conditioned and lose access to all other conditioning feats, but you may now respec your archetype into another path (e.g. Vigilante, Redeemer, Harrowed). You become Stupefied 1 as the scars of programming linger, until such time as you replace the edicts and anathema of the sisterhood with a new code. You will always be aware of any magical effect influencing your thoughts.

```

# Ascension
## Feat 10
---
==archetype==

**Archetype** Gray Maiden

**Prerequisites** Gray Maiden Dedication; Conditioned

---

You are the blade and the scabbard—the ideal made flesh. You have no fear. No dreams. No name. When you critically succeed at a Will save against a charm or mental effect, **the effect rebounds**, affecting the creature that attempted to influence you with its own effect. You are no longer considered to have a “true name”—some divinations fail to affect you.
