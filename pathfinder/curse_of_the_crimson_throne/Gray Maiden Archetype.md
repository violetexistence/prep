# Gray Maiden Dedication
## Feat 2
---
==uncommon== ==archetype== ==dedication==

**Archetype** Gray Maiden

**Prerequisites** trained in heavy armor; trained in intimidation 

**Access** You are from Korvosa and femme.

---

After passing the Queen's personal examination for strength and beauty, and then enduring a grueling initiation process, you were inducted into a military sisterhood loyal only to her.

**Conditioned** You are the product of indoctrination, repetition, and trauma-bound loyalty. Your psyche is rigidly fortified—enshrining the code of the sisterhood. The parts you consciously remember are listed below. There is at least one secret edict or anathema.
	**Edicts**
	- Serve the Queen's will without question or hesitation.
	- Obey the orders of sisters superior.
	**Anathema** 
	- Acting in ways that distinguish you from your sisters.
	- Undermine the cohesion of the sisterhood.

	**Effect** While conditioned, you gain the following benefits and flaws.
	- You **become trained in Will saves**; if you were already trained, you **become an expert** instead.
	- When you attempt to act against the code, you must attempt a **DC 5 flat check** to complete the action. Failure means you hesitate (lose the action). You can try again on your next turn. 
	- You do not dream.

**Tactics** In addition, you become trained in Warfare Lore; if you were already trained, you become an expert instead.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Gray Maiden archetype.

# Her Will, Your Hands `[reaction]`
## Feat 4
---
==archetype==

**Archetype** Gray Maiden

**Prerequisites** Gray Maiden Dedication; Conditioned

---

Her voice echoes through your memories, creating new meaning. Her will is certainty. Her orders are clarity in chaos. You gain a **+1 status bonus to Will saves** against any **emotional, fear, or mental effect** that would cause you to violate the code of the sisterhood. If you fail the save, you may attempt a new Will save against the effect as a reaction. You can attempt this new save only once for a given effect, even if you are compelled to violate your edict multiple times.

# Chosen Amulet
## Feat 4
---
==archetype==

**Archetype** Gray Maiden

**Prerequisites** Gray Maiden Dedication; Performed a service meaningful to the Queen personally.

---

The Queen herself bestows upon you a lacquer-crimson amulet inset with the three-tiered crown of House Arabasti. Few Maidens earn such a mark; fewer still live long enough to wear it. While the amulet hangs at your throat, you are set apart--both feared and favored. If you invest it, you gain a **+1 item bonus to Intimidation**. The symbol casts a dim crimson light in a 20-foot emanation.

**Activate** `[two-actions]` **Envision**
==concentrate== ==light== ==revelation==
	
**Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The light cast by the amulet becomes bright light for 10 minutes and shines through flesh to reveal faithless traitors. Creatures in the light receive a **-1 status penalty to Deception and Stealth** checks. You can Dismiss this activation.

# Vanguard Charge `[two-actions]`
## Feat 6
---
==archetype==

**Archetype** Gray Maiden

**Prerequisites** Gray Maiden Dedication; trained in Athletics

---

You are the tip of the spear, breaking the enemy’s line with relentless precision and force. Stride up to your Speed, attempting to move through one or more enemies' spaces during this movement. Attempt an **Athletics check** and compare the result to the **Will DC** of each creature whose space you attempt to enter.  
- **Success** you move through that creature’s space.  
- **Failure** your movement **ends before entering their space**.  

After your movement ends, you make a melee **Strike** against a target within reach (regardless of whether you moved through any creatures or not). 

**Special** If you are wearing **Gray Maiden Plate**, each creature whose space you successfully moved through is **Frightened 1**.

# Ashes of Obedience
## Feat 8
---
==archetype==

**Archetype** Gray Maiden

**Prerequisites** Gray Maiden Dedication; Conditioned

---

The mask doesn't fit quite like it used to. You've started dreaming again. Once per day, after failing a Will save, you may choose to critically succeed instead--but you take 2d6 mental damage and become Enfeebled 1 or Drained 1 (your choice). You gain a **+1 status bonus to Perception** checks to detect lies or manipulation.

```

```pf2e-stats
# Blood is Indulgence `[one-action]`
## Feat 8
---
==archetype== ==stance==

Archetype Gray Maiden

Whenever you would gain the **Clumsy**, **Enfeebled**, or **Slowed** condition, you may choose to instead take **1d6 mental damage** (this damage cannot be reduced or redirected).

The first time each minute you would be **reduced to 0 HP**, you gain **Temprorary HP** equal to your level, remain at 1 HP, and increase your **Wounded** condition by 1.

# Fracture
## Feat 10
---
==archetype==

**Archetype** Gray Maiden

**Prerequisites** Ashes of Obedience

---

You burn the oath. You shatter the mask. You feel every wound. And yet you stand. You are henceforth no longer conditioned and lose access to all other conditioning feats, but you may now respec your archetype into another path (e.g. Vigilante, Redeemer, Harrowed). You become Stupefied 1 as the scars of programming linger, until such time as you replace the edicts and anathema of the sisterhood with a new code. You will always be aware of any magical effect influencing your thoughts.

```

```pf2e-stats
# Ascension
## Feat 10
---
==archetype==

**Archetype** Gray Maiden

**Prerequisites** Gray Maiden Dedication; Conditioned

---

You are the blade and the scabbard—the ideal made flesh. You have no fear. No dreams. No name. When you critically succeed at a Will save against a charm or mental effect, **the effect rebounds**, affecting the creature that attempted to influence you with its own effect. You are no longer considered to have a “true name”—some divinations fail to affect you.

```

# Sister Superior
## Feat 6
---
==uncommon== ==archetype== ==dedication==

**Archetype** Gray Maiden

**Prerequisites** Gray Maiden Dedication; trained in Intimidation

Your loyalty and prowess set a standard to which your sisters aspire. You are inducted into an inner circle of veterans, equivalent to a non-comissioned officer rank such as might be called "sergeant" in other companies. You are expected to promulgate the will of the Queen and direct your sisters in battle.

**Authority** While you're conscious, you're surrounded by an aura in a 15-foot emanation. Your aura has the emotion, mental, and visual traits and grants you and allies in the aura a +1 status bonus to saving throws against fear.

**Move!** `[two-actions]` You Stride up to your speed and each ally within your paragon aura may Stride up to their speed as a reaction. If they choose to Stride, they are Slowed 1 until the end of their next turn.

**Special** You cannot select anotehr dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Sister Superior or Gray Maiden archetypes.

# Velsdarker
## Feat 10
---
==archetype== ==focus==

**Archetype** Sister Superior

**Prerequisites** Sister Superior Dedication; Promotion by the Queen.

---

You are a word bearer for the Queen. Where you walk, there is silence. Where you strike, there is no doubt.

They are otherwise kept close to Castle Korvosa guarding the royal house.

**Crown of Obedience** When you critically succeed on a Will save, you regain 1 Focus Point and your melee Strikes deal +1 damage per weapon die until the end of your next turn.

==auditory== ==concentrate== ==linguistic== ==mental== 
	You issue a **Command** to a single creature within 30 feet. You can command the target to approach you, run away (as if it had the fleeing condition), release what it's holding, drop prone, or stand in place. The target must attempt a Will save against your class DC.
	**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
	**Success** The target is Frightened 1.
	**Failure** The target Frightened 1 and must spend the first action on its next turn to obey your command.

# Deny the Gray Lady
## Feat 10
---
==archetype==

**Archetype** Sister Superior

**Prerequisites** Sister Superior Dedication

---

You no longer fall unconscious at 0 HP. Instead, the first time per day you would be reduced to 0 HP, you may choose to remain at 1 HP, gain temporary HP equal to your level, and become Doomed 1. If you already have the Doomed condition, it increases by 1 instead. This cannot prevent your death if Doomed 4 or greater. After using this feat you may Stride up to your speed or make a Strike as a free action.

```
