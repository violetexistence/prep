This delicate brass and crystal lantern houses a filament of braided silver aether-wire, encased in a bulb of everburning flame enchanted with detection wards. Originally engineered by gnome artificers and adopted by Korvosa’s reformist officials, a truthlamp casts steady, bright light in a 20-foot radius, but more importantly, it _detects the distortions of deceit_.  

While active, a **truthlamp subtly responds to magical influence**, flickering or humming in the presence of **illusion**, **mental manipulation**, or **divination magic**. It doesn’t name the spell or effect, but it alerts perceptive users to its presence.

- While the truthlamp is lit, any creature within the light that **casts or is under the effect of an illusion, enchantment, or divination spell** causes the flame to briefly shift color or emit a distinct hum.
- A creature in the area may attempt to **Lie**, but the lamp reacts violently if the lie is magically compelled (such as under _suggestion_ or _dominate_).
- Anyone in the light can attempt a **DC 15 Arcana, Occultism, or Perception check** to interpret the lamp’s response and determine the **school of magic** detected.  

**Special:** In The Ledger and certain legal chambers in Korvosa, use of a truthlamp is considered **supporting evidence** during testimony. Tampering with one is a **felony offense** punishable by branding and exile from civil service.
