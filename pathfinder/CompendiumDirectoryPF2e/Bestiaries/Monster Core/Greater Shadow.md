This is cumulative with other enfeebled conditions from shadows, to a maximum of [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 4]]. If this increases a creature's enfeebled value to 3 or more, the target's shadow is separated from its body (see shadow spawn). The enfeebled value from Steal Shadow decreases by 1 every hour."

Shadows that spend long amounts of time on the Netherworld and absorb its magic become greater shadows.

The mysterious undead known as shadows lurk in dark places and feed on those who stray too far from the light.
