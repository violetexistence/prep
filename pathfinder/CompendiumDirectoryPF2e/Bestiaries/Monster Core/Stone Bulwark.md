Stone bulwarks are slow and steady constructs typically carved from marble or granite. They're often made to serve as works of art when at rest, so some magical crafters employ master sculptors to ensure their constructs make beautiful statues. Older stone bulwarks might be weathered, with scuffed or cracked surfaces or missing noses and digits, but this weathering is largely cosmetic and doesn't adversely impact the bulwark's functionality.
