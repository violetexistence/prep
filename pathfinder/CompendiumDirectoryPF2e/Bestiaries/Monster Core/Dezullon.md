Dezullons are dangerous, carnivorous pitcher plants that dwell in forested regions with thick canopies or deep in marshes where few other plants can grow. They hunt for meat along the forest's understory when not sunning themselves in the boughs above. Dezullons are smart enough to notice that some creatures are attracted by shiny things, and sometimes use such objects to set up ambushes. To assume that the dezullon's ambulations are slow simply because the creature has a root structure is a foolish mistake; many an adventurer has been crushed to death by this surprisingly agile plant. In addition, dezullons are expert climbers, which makes escaping them in a forest even more difficult.

A hungry dezullon keeps prey off-balance by spilling its putrid, psychoactive digestive juices from its central pitcher. In addition to being highly acidic, the enzymes in a dezullon's digestive tract, once expelled, inflicts powerful hallucinations and amnesia. This secondary effect makes dezullons highly sought after in some circles, including avid drug users, experimental doctors, and criminals who deal in poisons.

Attempts to cultivate dezullons typically end in disaster, although druids and fey who can communicate with plants have found measured success. Meanwhile, horned dragons looking for breakthroughs in their research or groups of marsh giants seeking visions from their esoteric gods trust their power to hunt and overwhelm the plants.

Many varieties of dezullon exist, including lumbering giants of incredible size, dezullons with tiny, cup-shaped pitchers that proliferate along lengths of creeping ivy like suckers on a squid's tentacles, and a variant with hundreds of blood-red, razor-sharp leaves that protrude from the inside of their pitchers like a leech's teeth. This latter variety is especially dangerous, since the leaves can all but eviscerate creatures that become trapped inside their pitchers.
