The megaprimatus is among the mightiest of apes, quick to confront any perceived intrusions into its domain. With a height of 40 feet, it towers over even most giants, and is used to being the top-tier predator in the region.

While many apes exhibit peaceful or reclusive behavior, gorillas can be territorial, and the megaprimatus is especially aggressive and dangerous.
