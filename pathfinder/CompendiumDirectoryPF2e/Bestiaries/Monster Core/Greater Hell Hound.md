Believed to be bred by the Kings of Hell themselves within vast kennels, greater hell hounds are the favored guards and hunting hounds of powerful fiends and, rarely, mortals who worship them and have earned their favor.

Hell hounds are fiendish, extraplanar canines hailing from the Pit that can hunt down quarry and breathe supernatural gouts of flame. They are temperamental and quick to exhibit aggressive behavior.
