Brine sharks are deadly elementals that roam the endless oceans of the Plane of Water. They often slip into mortal oceans as well, competing with natural predators or even joining schools of flesh and blood sharks.

Water elementals can be very destructive, but often not intentionally so; just as water can bring life to mortals in need, its waves can pound shores and rains can flood cities. Water elementals are similarly difficult to predict.
