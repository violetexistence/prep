One of the most common types of nephilim is the pitborn, who bear a demonic corruption infesting their mortal bloodline.

* * *

Many immortals dwell upon the other planes of the Great Beyond. Some are benevolent and kind, like angels. Others are cruel and destructive, like demons. And some fit roles outside of morality, like psychopomps. It's far from unheard of for mortals and immortals alike to become entangled romantically, and the children of such engagements carry a supernatural element in their bloodlines for generations to follow. After the first generation, this otherworldly influence usually lies dormant, but now and then, the influence can manifest strongly in descendants many years later. These inheritors of extraplanar legacies are known collectively as planar scions.

## Nephilim

Nephilim are planar scions with a connection to the planes of the Outer Sphere. Some are obviously tied to realms such as Heaven or Hell, while others are cryptic amalgams of metaphysical traits.
