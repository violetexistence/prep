Tremorsense functions only if the monster is on the same surface as the subject, and only if the subject is moving along (or burrowing through) the surface."

Fearsome centipede-like creatures, mukradis are three-headed predators with a devastating array of ways to kill, burn, and dismember. A version of the mukradi that dwells in the Darklands is rumored to exist. It's said these variant mukradis have black scales, and all of their heads spew a black, acidic goo that animates before being reabsorbed by the mukradis.
