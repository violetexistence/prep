The average azarketi citizen in Absalom makes a living fishing or catching crabs.

* * *

Azarketis, also known as gillmen, can be found all over Golarion, with a particularly high concentration around Absalom and the Inner Sea. Descendants of the ancient Azlanti, the azarketis survived the cataclysm of Earthfall by fleeing into the ocean, where they were warped into amphibious forms by the alghollthu.
