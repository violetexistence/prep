    desc: "`pf2:1` (arcane,concentrate,polymorph) The jaathoom transforms into a Small or Medium air elemental or aerial animal, such as an owl. This doesn't affect their statistics, but it could change the damage type of their Strikes.\n* * *\n\nThe monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

    desc: "`pf2:2` (mental,prediction) The jaathoom sends a prophetic dream to a sleeping creature within 10 feet. An unwilling creature avoids the vision if it succeeds at a `DC 23 Will check` save.\n\nThe jaathoom chooses the dream's subject, but not its exact events. The target sees a brief vision of its future related to that subject, with the effect of [[Spells/Augury|Augury]]. If the result is bad or mixed, the creature is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] and can't recover from being frightened until it wakes."

Possessing all the subtlety and elegance of air itself, the jaathooms of the Plane of Air operate within dreams, nightmares, and time.

Before mortal history, genies were some of the first creations of the cosmos to possess free will. Formed of elemental matter, they traversed the Universe and the six elemental planes of air, earth, fire, metal, water, and wood. The genies who remained on each elemental plane found their matter replaced with those elements. Genies of metal and wood appear in _Pathfinder Rage of Elements_.

## Genie Shuyookhs

Older, wiser, and more powerful genies possess greater power and are revered with the title of shuyookh (typically adjusted to "sheikha" if the genie is female or "sheikh" for a male). Generally at least 5 levels higher than a typical example of their kind, a shuyookh gains additional spells. The basics of shuyookhs appear here in sidebars and are detailed further in _Rage of Elements_.

The most wondrous of their powers is their ability to grant wishes three times per year. This is not an innate ability but a ritual practice passed down over time in an attempt to replicate the wish-granting abilities of janns.
