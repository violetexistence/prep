Giant octopuses are found in the heart of deep, dark oceans. Clever and adaptable, they hunt and devour all manner of animals. Despite growing up to 16 feet long, a giant octopus can compress its body to squeeze through small gaps as long as there's room for its beak.

Giant octopuses favor shipwrecks, coral reefs, or underwater caverns as lairs, where they can take advantage of narrow confines for protection. Like their smaller kin, they're fond of adorning and decorating their lairs with found objectsâ€”many of which, in the giant octopus's case, are also magical weapons, shields, or works of art salvaged from sunken ships or fallen adventurers.
