Witchwargs are related to wargs, but are larger, smarter, and far more dangerous. They are capable of exhaling plumes of freezing breath. When they deign to serve others, they usually reserve this privilege for more dangerous creatures, such as the winter witches of Irrisen.

The warg is an intelligent and malevolent wolf that dwells among goblins, hobgoblins, orcs, and violent humanoids.
