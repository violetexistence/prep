    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,polymorph,primal) The gimmerling takes on the appearance of any humanoid. In humanoid form, They lose their treacherous aura, and their equipment appears to be trinkets or toys. If the chosen form lacks claws or fangs, they lose the matching Strike. If they lose their claw Strike, they gain a fist Strike that is identical except that it deals bludgeoning damage.\n* * *\n\nThe monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

Gimmerlings are small, shapeshifting fey who stage ambushes to sate their endless hunger and childish greed. These cruelly curious fey obsess over finding and making unusual traps and sadistic weapons, and their favorite amusement is seeing these traps sprung or the weapons wielded. When residing on Golarion, they're frequently found in urban areas, particularly slums or other parts of town, where they can either go unnoticed or be easily forgotten—and have plenty of victims to choose from.

A typical gimmerling disguises themself as an endangered child, hoping to draw creatures close enough to rob. The gimmerling puts themself in apparent danger using a trap, construct, a bribed ally, or even a coerced monster.

Because gimmerlings sometimes trade obscure smithing or trapping techniques in exchange for gifts that sate their curiosity, their greed, or their hunger, they have at times been worshipped as minor gods of the forge. Some disciplined gimmerlings work as honored artisans, elite guards, or spies for the demigods known as the Eldest, who dwell in the depths of the First World.
