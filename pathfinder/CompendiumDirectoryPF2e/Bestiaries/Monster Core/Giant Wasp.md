Giant wasps are much more dangerous but less common than their smaller kin, and—to the relief of those who encounter them—they tend to be solitary.

While the common wasp poses little threat to a hardy adventurer aside from an uncomfortable sting, a large and aggressive swarm of these territorial insects—to say nothing of their oversized kin—can lay low an entire party of heroes. The wasps represented here are of the common variety, also known as yellow jackets, but many other sorts of dangerous wasps exist, such as a Garundi variant that swarms in such great numbers that it can decimate entire villages.
