Bandersnatches are great six-legged cats with wicked quills running down the length of their bodies down to the tips of their mighty tails. As with other legendary creatures from the First World, such as the jabberwock, bandersnatches belong to the infamous group of creatures known collectively as the "Tane." These terrifying hunters take great delight in taking down other deadly or intelligent predators by perfectly adapting to any environment they find themselves in. A bandersnatch stalks their quarry before lashing out with speed and ferocity. Those who survive a bandersnatch attack will confirm that while the cats' fangs and claws are deadly, their eyes are their greatest weapon of all. A bandersnatch's eyes are constantly shifting in color, intensity, and design, causing those they gaze upon to fall into a confused panic.
