All dwarves share a connection to the earth, but stonecasters have focused and polished that connection. Their years of meditation have granted them the ability to create boulders and shake the very earth. These elemental specialists are often highly respected in their community, which prizes their art of geomancy. Young dwarves who show a stronger than normal connection to the earth might be sent to a stonecaster to train at an early age.

A dwarf's strength comes from their stoic determination, quality equipment, and their ability to hold grudges for centuries.
