Also called void wanderers, rhu-chaliks can survive the depths of space indefinitely, passing between worlds over the eons and scouting those planets for the Dominion of the Black. Rhu-chaliks prefer to work alone in order to reduce potential overlap in their mental predations, but sometimes receive assistance from those who believe the transmission of memories is transcendent. The furtive beings are calculating and infinitely patient, seeking only the most exceptional minds to cast beyond the stars to their masters.

* * *

The Dominion of the Black is a conglomeration of deep-space conquerors with a strong presence on Aucturn, the most remote planet in Golarion's solar system. The Dominion has secret outposts all over Golarion; most of its members on the planet are scouts, using their skills to steal brains and identities, gathering information without any consideration for the inhabitants of the worlds they infiltrate.
