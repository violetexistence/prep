This big-headed beast is covered in glittering scales; its eyes are like large copper pots, and its mouth is full of sharp teeth. Despite its fish-like appearance, a quai dau to spends most of its time on land hunting along riversides or lakes. It uses its trunk to drain the nearby water before using it with deadly skill. A quai dau to can expel the water with a force strong enough to knock a knight off a horse, or gently enough to surround themself in a veil of mist.

A quai dau to is extremely sensitive to sound. If they hear too much ruckus near their hunting grounds, they violently attack. Their silent movement allows them to sneak up on such distracted prey despite their massive size. Researchers have discovered, after much study, that quai dau tos don't have ears in the traditional sense. They have an organ in the upper part of their skulls that inflates to hold the water they use in their attacks. This organ is extremely sensitive to vibrations in the air and is used as a pseudo ear.
