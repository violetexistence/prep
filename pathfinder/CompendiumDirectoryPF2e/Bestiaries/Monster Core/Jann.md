    desc: "`pf2:1` (arcane,concentrate,polymorph) The jann transforms into any Small or Medium animal. This doesn't affect their statistics, but it could change the damage type of their Strikes.\n* * *\n\nThe monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

This has no cost. That creature specifies what they wish for, but the interpretation is up to the jann. A jann typically attempts to grant wishes in a way that encourages growth and exploration.\n\nA summoned jann can't use this ability."

All six elements build each jann and fill them with a constant desire to travel, typically jaunting about the Universe. The eldest among geniekind, they command respect from their distant offspring. Any jann can grant wishes, not just shuyookhs—a vestige of their ancient power.

* * *

Before mortal history, genies were some of the first creations of the cosmos to possess free will. Formed of elemental matter, they traversed the Universe and the six elemental planes of air, earth, fire, metal, water, and wood. The genies who remained on each elemental plane found their matter replaced with those elements. Genies of metal and wood appear in _Pathfinder Rage of Elements_.

## Genie Shuyookhs

Older, wiser, and more powerful genies possess greater power and are revered with the title of shuyookh (typically adjusted to "sheikha" if the genie is female or "sheikh" for a male). Generally at least 5 levels higher than a typical example of their kind, a shuyookh gains additional spells. The basics of shuyookhs appear here in sidebars and are detailed further in _Rage of Elements_.

The most wondrous of their powers is their ability to grant wishes three times per year. This is not an innate ability but a ritual practice passed down over time in an attempt to replicate the wish-granting abilities of janns.
