The ghoul attempts a skill check using a skill in which the consumed creature was trained (if it's unclear whether the creature was trained, the GM decides). The ghoul is treated as trained and uses the high skill modifier for the ghoul's level. This takes the same amount of actions or time as usual for the check.\n\nThe ghoul can instead automatically learn something specific known by a creature it consumed in the last 7 days, like the location of a [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] treasure or the name of a loved one. The ghoul can do this only once for a given creature, no matter how much of its flesh the ghoul consumed."

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

Retaining their martial skill, these powerful ghouls are not afraid to meet their foe in the open, feeding on the flesh of their fallen opponents to learn their combat abilities.

Few creatures are more ubiquitous to sinister locations such as lonely graveyards and ruined crypts than the flesh-eating undead known as ghouls.
