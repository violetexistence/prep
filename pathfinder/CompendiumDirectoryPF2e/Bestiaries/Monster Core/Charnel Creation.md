Made of odd scraps of skin and muscle, a charnel creation is a grotesque parody of life. Though it has no mind, it can still go into a berserk rage when harmed, giving it a faint semblance of emotion. These constructs are often fashioned to guard the secret laboratories, unhallowed funerary grounds, and bloody charnel houses of fleshwarpers and necromancers who feel no compunctions about desecrating corpses for their own ends. Though the first charnel creation is believed to have been a misguided attempt to create life from simple base elements, these monstrosities are far from human. In isolated cases, echoes of a personality might rise in a charnel creation if the brain used as part of its construction belonged to a particularly powerful personality, but such tragic instances are (thankfully) rare in the extreme.
