While many know orcas as "killer whales," they're actually the largest species of dolphin. These powerful animals hunt together in pods to take down seals, sharks, and even whales. Adult orcas are typically 15–25 feet long and weigh 8,000–12,000 pounds.

Dolphins encompass a wide range of aquatic mammals, all of which are social, intelligent, and widespread throughout the world's oceans.
