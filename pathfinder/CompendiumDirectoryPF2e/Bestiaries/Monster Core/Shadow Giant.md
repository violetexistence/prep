Shadow giants are natives of the Netherworld, where they have dwelled in perpetual twilight for millennia. They live in familiar groups and uphold a nomadic way of life as they roam across ancestral lands between shadowy forests and misty chasms. These hunter-gatherers pass down lore through oral histories, conduct pilgrimages to unholy ziggurats of black stone, and bathe in the blood of their long-standing foes, including rival shadow giant clans and fiends of the Netherworld intent on enslaving their kind.

Standing 15 feet tall, with gray skin and hair only a shade lighter, shadow giants are fearsome foes with a well-earned reputation as zealous warmongers and ruthless combatants. They rarely interact with outsiders, though they may treat with proven warriors who show the giants the respect and deference they feel they deserve.

Giants are massive humanoid creatures who live in remote regions throughout the world. They vary widely but are united in their hunger, requiring sustenance of their own element along with the feasts one would expect from such a massive humanoid. Although a simple matter for some giants, more esoteric types find this need a harsh reality. While a massive fistful of ice or snow alongside their meal will satisfy a frost giant, shadow giants hunger for the coagulated shadows of the Netherworld.
