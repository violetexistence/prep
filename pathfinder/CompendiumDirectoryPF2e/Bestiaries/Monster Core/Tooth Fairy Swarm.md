    desc: "`pf2:1`  Tooth fairies pinch their victims' fingers, noses, ears, or similar protruding body parts. Each enemy in the swarm's space takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage (`DC 20 Reflex check` save). Creatures that critically fail this save are [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] from the pain."

  - name: "Pry"
    desc: "`pf2:3`  The tooth fairies try to pry out one of their target's teeth. One enemy in the swarm's space takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage with a `DC 20 Reflex check` save. On a failed save, the target takes 2 bleed damage and loses a tooth.\n\nIf the creature loses a tooth, it takes a –1 status penalty to Charisma-based skill checks and must succeed at a `DC 5 Flat check` to Cast a Spell unless that spell has the subtle trait. These effects last for 1 day, or until the stolen tooth is returned and the target regains at least 1 Hit Point.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Tooth Tug|Effect: Tooth Tug]]"

A mob of tooth fairies working together can conduct forced dentistry in seconds.

Tooth fairies spawn when a child's tooth (or, less commonly, an entire child) is buried in terrain rife with fey energies. Hatching from the buried teeth like larvae from an egg, tooth fairies build crude pliers from whatever they can find, then go hunting for more teeth—regardless of the owners' willingness.
