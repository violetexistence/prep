A swarm of rats can cause total chaos within a household or business. Contracting putrid plague is all the easier when dozens of these agitated or hungry vermin gather to bite victims en masse, making rat-hunting a viable career in many parts of the world as desperate townspeople seek relief from the disease's spread.

Rats are a ubiquitous menace, scurrying through the sewers and on the streets of nearly every settlement in the world. Though a regular rat darting underfoot might startle or even frighten the average passerby, giant rats and rat swarms are far more dangerous.
