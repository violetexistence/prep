Horses serve as mounts and beasts of burden in many societies. They are loyal and typically gentle creatures, and they are invaluable to those looking to travel long distances. Smaller folk, like gnomes and halflings, often utilize ponies as mounts, while horses are the favored steeds for humans and other Medium humanoids. Most horses that the average humanoid encounters are domesticated, though large herds can be found in the wild.
