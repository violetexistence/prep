Zephyr hawks drift among the currents of the Plane of Air in great flocks. They delight in riding the air currents with no destination in mind.

Hailing from the Plane of Air, these beings appear in a variety of sizes and shapes. They're noted for being elusive, swift, and often difficult to detect due to being composed primarily of air.
