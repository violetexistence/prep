Despite their flaming blades and ring of unblinking eyes, aesras are the diplomats of peace among the archons, preferring justice via compromise and mutual benefit rather than justice by the sword. Nonetheless, when forced to fight against fiendish powers aesras don't hesitate in battle, mounting offensives under divine commanders like Iomedae.

Archons are guardians of Heaven and enemies of corruption. Before gods and their servants set foot in the celestial planes, archons already resided in Heaven, the original inhabitants of the realm. Upon meeting, the archons and divine angels quickly discovered they were of a kind, holding justice and righteousness in their hearts. An alliance was formed, and archons now serve as stalwart allies to all celestials and mortals they find worthy.

While the first archons coalesced from the immense seven-tiered mountain of Heaven, they choose willing and worthy Heaven-bound souls to join their ranks. These mortals hear and answer the call of a mysterious voice, manifesting in the Garden at the mountain's peak. There they swear to forever serve the cause of justice and transform into their new archon forms.

Though deeply concerned with defending mortal life and willing to sacrifice themselves in battle against fiends, archons often feel rote and inscrutable to others, and their forms can border on frightening and bizarre. For this reason, they often have issues with interacting with mortals, or with the free spirited azatas. Despite this, archons draw great strength from others, especially those who exemplify virtue.

Beyond their celestial allies, archons also maintain ancient ties with aeons. The inscrutable factions can still be seen working together to defend longforgotten secrets and enforce rules that predate mortal life. Archons explain these missions as necessary without further elaboration, leaving even their angelic allies frustrated with archons' obstinance.
