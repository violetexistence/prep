Between their finely crafted equipment and natural bravery, a dwarf warrior can hold their ground against mighty foes. If respected, these warriors can become life-long allies; if slighted, they can become a thorn in one's side for the remainder of one's life.

A dwarf's strength comes from their stoic determination, quality equipment, and their ability to hold grudges for centuries.
