According to axiomites, their kind rose from the raw mathematical underpinnings of the universe, manifesting as great builders who created the ancient, colossal cities of the Outer Planes. According to aeons, axiomites are part of the Monad, having both risen from and rebelled against it long ago. Since the Convergence, most axiomites have recognized this as a fundamental truth, particularly after the aeons showed the axiomites how the Utopian language has formed as an amalgam of aeon envisioning and formulaic mathematical expression. Most axiomites live in the perfect city of Axis, which they continually act to improve, thus refining the concept of perfection itself.

A particular axiomite may look like any humanoid creature, though the particular form it takes on does not affect its abilities. Beneath this assumed form, all axiomites are the same—clouds of glowing, crystalline dust that constantly swirl and congeal into complex tangles of symbols and equations, evincing axiomite existence as literal creatures of pure mathematical law.

Axiomites arise from the souls of mortals fascinated with the underpinnings of their Universe, particularly those who were, in life, mathematicians, architects, crafters, or philosophers. While these souls do not retain any memories of their lives in the transition into axiomites, their life skills and experiences nevertheless serve as a valuable metaphysical resource during formation.

Aeons have always been the caretakers of reality and defenders of the natural order of balance. Each type of aeon takes on some form of duality in its manifestation and works either to shape the multiverse within the aspects of this duality in some way, or to correct imbalances to the perfect order of existence. Aeons' machinations can raise a nation, raze it, or restore it from ruin. Their reasons are their own, and they rarely share their motivations with others—through their strange envisioning mode of communication, they simply create the results they insist are necessary to maintain the balance of the multiverse.

As a result of recent shifts in reality, aeons have begun to reassert a presence in the perfect planar city of Axis. To aeons, this is merely the latest in a recurring cycle, albeit one that mortals have not yet borne witness to. Aeons have a name for this cyclic return, in which they welcome their industrious axiomite brethren back to their fold: the Convergence. At the onset of the Convergence, a council of pleroma aeons appeared in the Eternal City of Axis, where they revealed that axiomites were wayward aeons, split off long ago to pursue the act of creation. With the latest cycle of change, it was time for axiomites—and their mortal creations and kin—to rejoin the aeon cause. While most axiomites fell in line, realizing perhaps on a fundamental level of reality that what the aeons said was the truth, some refused to heed the call and waited for the wrath of the aeons. That wrath has yet to come. The dual-natured aeons have responded to those who have declined in confusing ways. With some they treat and even bargain, while a handful of others they have destroyed, and a few have been exterminated by the axiomites. But most of these quiet insurgents they leave alone, allowing these axiomites to continue to create in peace. How—or if—this Convergence will end is as little understood as aeons themselves.
