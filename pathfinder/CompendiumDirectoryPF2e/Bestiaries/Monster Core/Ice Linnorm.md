    desc: "`pf2:2` (cold,primal) The ice linnorm spews out a blast of freezing, viscous ooze in a 60-foot cone that deals 15d6 cold damage to creatures within the area (`DC 38 Reflex check` save).\n\nThe freezing ooze clings to those struck and hardens into thick sheets of ice. A creature that fails the saving throw is [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] by the ice until it succeeds at a check to [[Actions/escape dc=34|escape dc=34]] or it or an ally [[Actions/force-open dc=34|force-open dc=34]]{Forces Open} the ice (DC 34 for either case). At the start of its turn, a creature still immobilized by the ice takes 4d6 cold damage. Another creature can free a frozen target by dealing a total of 20 fire damage to the frozen target. Left unattended, the ice crumbles away in 1 minute on its own.\n\nCreatures with the fire trait can't be frozen in place by Icemire Breath. Flying creatures fall if frozen, and swimming creatures that are frozen rise toward the surface of the water at a speed of 60 feet per round.\n\nThe linnorm can't use Icemire Breath again for 1d4 rounds."

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead spend an action to use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

The ice linnorm dwells amid glacial crevasses, atop wind-blasted mountain peaks, or within glittering caverns carved from the hearts of the mightiest of icebergs.

Immense, primeval dragons of the northern reaches of the world, linnorms hate those they deem to be lesser creatures and seek to inflict as much suffering as possible upon their unfortunate victims. While these serpentine monstrosities might not be the powerful winged dragons most imagine, they nonetheless possess incredible strength and deadly powers that often rival authentic dragon brutality.
