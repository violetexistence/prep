Living wildfires appear as humanoids made of living fire, burning everything they come across for the pure joy of it. Summoners take advantage of this joy and the elementals' explosive ends to spread destruction.

Fire elementals are destructive manifestations of the scorching Plane of Fire. Although most fire elementals revel in the chance to experience new kinds of fires away from their home plane, even the most considerate fire elemental can be a danger to humanoids and their property.
