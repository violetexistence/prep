Tabellias are the elite messengers of the celestial realms, serving deities and celestial armies by delivering messages, performing reconnaissance, and providing support for those in need of aid. They watch over planar travelers and take powerful mortals under their wings to mentor them. Tabellias carry scrolls containing important messages and other celestial secrets. Most creatures, even wicked ones, respect the strength of tabellias and allow them to travel untroubled.

Tabellias can form spontaneously from the souls of exceptional mortals but are also sometimes created from such souls intentionally by deities or demigods. In the latter cases, tabellias often bear physical features that mark them as closely affiliated with that deity. A tabellia created by Sarenrae, for example, might have hair made of fire, while one created by Torag might look more dwarven, and one created by Desna could have butterfly wings instead of feathered wings. It's not unusual for tabellias created by deities to share their creators' philosophies and interests.

The celestial hosts of angels are messengers and warriors, divided into choirs based on their abilities and purviews. Angels were one of the first creations of the gods, and many still assist their righteous creators throughout the cosmos. Most angels in modern times are not direct creations of the divine, however, instead consisting of ascended mortal souls drawn from the celestial planes.

The majority of unaffiliated angels live in Nirvana, the plane of virtue and enlightenment. Angels who are affiliated with deities dwell in those deities' domains or other areas where that god holds influence. Regardless of residence or service, angels remain benevolent messengers possessed with magical auras to aid their allies.
