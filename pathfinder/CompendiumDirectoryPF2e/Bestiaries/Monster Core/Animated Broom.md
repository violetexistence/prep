Animated brooms perform menial tasks of cleaning and upkeep, but they can step in to defend a room from intrusion if needed. These simple animated objects can be found with greater frequency than more complicated and costly objects.

Granted a semblance of life through the use of rituals or other strange magic, animated objects take many forms and serve a variety of uses. A few examples of typical animated objects are listed below. Many of these creatures serve as guardians, surprising unsuspecting adventurers when they suddenly attack. Others serve as idle distractions for the exceptionally rich, simple servants created to handle odd jobs, and the like.
