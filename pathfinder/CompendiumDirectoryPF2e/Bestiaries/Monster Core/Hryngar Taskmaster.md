Hryngar priests of the taskmaster god Droskar often assume leadership roles within their communities, advancing the goals of their deity through coercion and displays of force. Often referred to as hryngar taskmasters, these leaders issue commands to hryngar subordinates and subjugated contractual clients in the same breath, treating the two as if they were interchangeable. As a result, hryngar taskmasters are equally loathed by practically everyone.

Deep beneath the surface, the dour dwarves known as hryngars stubbornly toil, claiming the ancestral subterranean homelands of other dwarves as their own. Long ago, hryngar leaders refused to venture to the surface along with their "cousins," forsaking the Quest for Sky. An exiled dwarven deity named Droskar offered hryngars salvation from the horrors that beset them in the Darklands, offering them power, cunning, and knowledge in exchange for their unending servitude. Many hryngar believe that by working harder than their brethren, they can build a society far greater than anything under the sun, claiming unending riches from the planet's metallic veins in days of relentless toil.

Through Droskar's blessings and their own fearsome work ethic, hryngar kingdoms now rule a significant portion of the upper Darklands region of NarVoth, and it's common to see hryngar caravans moving through the tunnels, drawn by teams of immense beetles. Hryngar leadership typically consists of powerful divine servants of Droskar, along with fearsomely implacable warriors whose martial prowess, backed by innate occult magic, ensures they can overcome any direct threat to hryngar rule. Almost every aspect of hryngar society is controlled by a strict hierarchy of leadership, with taskmasters directing subordinates across all walks of life.
