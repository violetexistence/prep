Ofalths reproduce asexually. When they first hatch from their leathery eggs, larval ofalths resemble a tendril of flesh supported by spindly legs, but they soon cocoon themselves in trash, to serve as both armor and camouflage.

Found in castle dung heaps, city dumps, and sewers, ofalths are living amalgamations of wet detritus, sewage, and rubbish. They carry a disease called wretched weeps that causes the victim's blood to seep from its pores.
