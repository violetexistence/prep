Physically imposing sedacthies prove their status by controlling dangerous aquatic creatures like great white sharks and giant moray eels.

* * *

Sedacthies are amphibious, fish-like humanoids who lurk in Golarion's oceans and are known for leading their animal servants ashore to devour air breathers. When an entire fishing village disappears overnight, sedacthies are the first suspects. Sedacthies pride themselves as natural leaders, with ambition limited only by their strict adherence to hierarchy. A sedacthy's station is determined by the strength of the animal servants they press into service, and the mettle they prove during hunts and in battles against outsiders.
