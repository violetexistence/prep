    desc: "`pf2:2` (fire,primal) The crag linnorm breathes out a stream of magma in a 120-foot line that deals 12d6 fire damage to creatures within the area (`DC 34 Reflex check` save). Any creature that fails its save also takes 4d6 persistent fire damage.\n\nThe linnorm can't use Magma Breath again for 1d4 rounds.\n\nThe magma remains until the start of the linnorm's next turn. If the linnorm was on the ground, the magma remains as a burning line on the ground directly under the line of the Magma Breath; if the linnorm was airborne, the magma rains down in a sheet 60 feet high. Any creature that moves across or through the magma takes 6d6 fire damage (`DC 34 Reflex check` save).\n\nAt the start of the linnorm's next turn, the magma cools to a thin layer of brittle stone, or the magma rain finishes falling and turns to harmless pebbles. The cooled magma quickly degrades to powder and sand over the course of several hours."

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead spend an action to use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

Despite being among the weakest linnorms, the crag linnorm is a devastating predator, capable of quickly cooking their foes with their magma breath.

Immense, primeval dragons of the northern reaches of the world, linnorms hate those they deem to be lesser creatures and seek to inflict as much suffering as possible upon their unfortunate victims. While these serpentine monstrosities might not be the powerful winged dragons most imagine, they nonetheless possess incredible strength and deadly powers that often rival more notorious dragons' brutality.
