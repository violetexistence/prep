Found mostly in colder climates, mammoths are accustomed to dealing with desperate and dangerous predators, trampling and crushing their enemies while using their larger tusks to greater effect. Humanoids dwelling in harsh, frost-bound lands rely on the mammoth's strength to help them survive.

Immediately recognizable by their long, prehensile trunks and impressive tusks, elephants have different characteristics depending on where they are found. Elephants are used as beasts of burden in many regions, but they are extremely clever and must be handled with great care.
