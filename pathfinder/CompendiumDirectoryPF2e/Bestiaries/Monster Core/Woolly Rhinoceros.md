Even bulkier than their non-woolly cousins, these rhinoceroses have a shaggy pelt of long, thick fur and a huge, crescent-shaped horn. Woolly rhinos inhabit areas of arid tundra and cold steppes, spending much of their day grazing for sustenance.

* * *

This hefty animal is easily recognizable by the distinctive upward-thrusting horn on its snout. Rhinoceroses are herbivorous and, in spite of their hulking size, can run at considerable speed. While rhinos have good hearing and a keen sense of smell, their eyesight is relatively poor.
