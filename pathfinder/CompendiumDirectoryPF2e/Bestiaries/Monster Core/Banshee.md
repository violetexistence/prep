This Wail overcomes silence and similar effects of 5th rank or lower. The banshee can instead use Wail as a three-action activity to overcome such effects of up to 8th rank.\n\nThe banshee's Wail resonates for 1 round, and any creature that comes within the area during that time must attempt a save against the effect. A creature can't be affected more than once by the same Wail. The banshee can't Wail again for 1d4 rounds."

Banshees are the furious, tormented souls of those bound to the world by a betrayal that defined the final hours of their lives. Some banshees arise from those who were slain by trusted friends and allies, or whose loved ones betrayed them on their deathbeds. Others spawn from those whose treacherous deeds shortly before their deaths left a stain upon their souls. Regardless of their origin, banshees despise the living. This hatred of life is all too often a horrific inversion of their personalities in life. Some speculate that the more kind-hearted the person (and the more wrenching the betrayal), the crueler the banshee.

Banshees rarely stray far from where they perished and typically haunt thick forests and canopied swamps where little light graces the ground. Many banshees are elves and can be found in the elven nation of Kyonin, specifically in Tanglebriar, the sinister domain of the demon Treerazer. Similarly, a large number of banshees can be found lurking in the frozen wastes in northern Avistan, created from a cruel and widespread betrayal that is centuries old.
