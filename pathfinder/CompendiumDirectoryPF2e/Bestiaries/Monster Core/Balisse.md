Balisses, or confessor angels, seek to assist mortals ensnared by moral dilemmas or crises of faith. They prefer to guide people to their own decisions rather than demand obedience to a higher cause, as intrinsic belief is even more powerful than unquestioning obedience. While most balisses are fundamentally honest, they use their guiding angel ability to seem less intimidating and decrease the chance the mortal will simply acquiesce to the opinion of an obviously divine being.

While balisses can spring from any soul with suitable patience and strong counsel, they often form from souls of those who performed evil acts but were redeemed. These souls recognize the struggle and shame of those in similar situations, and can offer advice from the heart rather than from rote sympathy. Many serve the goddess Sarenrae, but they can serve other good deities and empyreal lords as well.

The celestial hosts of angels are messengers and warriors, divided into choirs based on their abilities and purviews. Angels were one of the first creations of the gods, and many still assist their righteous creators throughout the cosmos. Most angels in modern times are not direct creations of the divine, however, instead consisting of ascended mortal souls drawn from the celestial planes.

The majority of unaffiliated angels live in Nirvana, the plane of virtue and enlightenment. Angels who are affiliated with deities dwell in those deities' domains or other areas where that god holds influence. Regardless of residence or service, angels remain benevolent messengers possessed with magical auras to aid their allies.
