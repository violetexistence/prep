Although caligni hunters are often pressed into leading their skulker kin, most hunters prefer to wander the Darklands or raid the surface free from those responsibilities. Their preferred assaults are usually done by solo caligni hunters or in small groups of two or three.

Calignis lurk in subterranean cities, with each caligni growing into a specific role and form determined by supernatural influences in caligni society. Regardless of their size or role, all calignis are gaunt, with pale flesh and white eyes. Many relish the chance to creep above ground at night to steal resources, shadow their surface counterparts, or simply make mischief.
