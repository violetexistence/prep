Hyaenodons are ferocious primeval creatures that resemble hyenas. Looming, shaggy-furred animals nearly the size of a horse, hyaenodons are truly formidable predators to be reckoned with, due both to their size and to their flesh-shearing jaws. Hyaenodons prey on small horses, camels, and even young rhinoceroses. Kholo clans find these creatures particularly useful as mounts and guardians.

Hyenas are pack-hunting scavengers known for their unnerving, laughterlike cries. The most well-known hyenas are the socially gregarious spotted hyenas, who travel in packs and work together to hunt or drive off larger creatures. Hyenas are typically nocturnal creatures who scavenge meat, insects, and fruit, though they aren't above supplementing their carrion diets with fresh prey.
