Dero stalkers explore the surface world by night, seeking out victims to abduct. While hiding from the burning light of day, stalkers often assist with magisters' experiments.

Deros are short, wiry humanoids with milky white eyes, gray-blue skin, and wild shocks of off-white or gray hair. The descendants of a mysterious type of fey abandoned in the deepest, darkest caverns of Golarion, deros are the subject of fearful legends and folk tales to most of the world's surface races. They skulk beneath major metropolitan areas, performing cruel and twisted experiments on unwilling subjects.

Deros, particularly the leading magisters, are fixated with curing their allergy to sunlight. To understand how the surface dwellers can withstand the light of the sun, deros conduct late-night raids on surface cities, abducting victims and performing terrible experiments on them. Those who survive are often returned with much of their memory erased and their bodies bearing mysterious scars.

The largest dero settlements are built around esoteric machines of floating crystals. As these crystals grind against each other and hum with sickening blue energy, crystal flakes and powdery residue collect beneath the machinery. Dero magisters gather these products, creating tools and repurposing the crystals to power magical items.
