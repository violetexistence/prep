Traditionally crafted into the forms of giant suits of armor or powerful animals, iron wardens are products of exquisite artistry and skill. Their articulated joints and sturdy, armored bodies require great care and mathematical precision to craft, and regular cleaning and oiling ensure they don't rust over the ages. With proper care, iron wardens can remain in good shape for thousands of years, being passed down for generations, as long as they aren't destroyed by meddlesome adventurers. In addition to their incredible strength, iron wardens possess a potent toxic breath that is often more than enough to dispatch entire groups of opponents.

Though their impressive stature prevents them from being inconspicuous, iron wardens are often placed in areas where they are easily mistaken for decorative objects. An iron warden might be hidden among decorative suits of armor or disguised as a statue in a city square. Occasionally, locals are shocked when something they assumed to be a historic landmark animates into an iron warden, called to action by an unknown mystic command.

Stories tell of ancient civilizations, such as the Jistka Imperium, that created iron wardens of massive size. Most of these constructs have since been melted down for resources, but magicians and historians still chase down rumors of one of these lost colossi.
