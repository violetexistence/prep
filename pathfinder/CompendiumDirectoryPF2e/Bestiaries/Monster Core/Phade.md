On the Plane of Air, and throughout the Inner Sphere, phades serve as spies and assassins for their creators. Even when summoned into the mortal Universe, phades are generally called for unsavory and violent purposes, giving the phades that have turned their back on their creator a poor opinion of mortals as well.

Hailing from the Plane of Air, these beings appear in a variety of sizes and shapes. They're noted for being elusive, swift, and often difficult to detect due to being composed primarily of air.
