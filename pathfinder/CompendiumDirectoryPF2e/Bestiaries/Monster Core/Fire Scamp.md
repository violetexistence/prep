Although arguably quite friendly, fire scamps are considered far more dangerous than their kin. They delight in fire and playing pranks on everyone they befriend. Even given time to understand others' dislike of fire, most fire scamps enjoy the feel of flames enough to constantly test their limits.

Compared to the nations of other scamps, the nations on the Plane of Fire are by far the strongest. This backing inspires fire scamps to challenge authority more quickly than the others.

Elemental scamps are bat-like critters marked by elemental powers. Scamps are dispatched from the Elemental Planes by more powerful residents or called to the Universe by neophyte summoners. All scamps have a hint of magical power due to a lingering connection to their home plane, which they largely use to pull simple pranks.

Scamps rapidly form a pecking order of cleverness. Humanoids often confuse scamps when meeting such creatures for the first time. These confused scamps usually resort to an escalating series of pranks and mischief, seeing what they can get away with to establish their place in the hierarchy.
