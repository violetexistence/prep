This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

Four-armed seraptis demons are radical nihilists at heart, despising other creatures out of bitter entitlement and laughing hysterically when others die or suffer. They arise from souls that engaged in dedicated campaigns of misery, driving their victims toward despair and suicide. After their awakening as a seraptis, the hungry mouths carved into their arms devour others' suffering, bringing a lively hue to the demon's cold skin.

These demons seek to drag mortals down to their level, luring pawns into deepseated resentment. Feeding their targets an unending stream of half-truths and propaganda, they often drive these mortals to vent their rage into unforgivable deeds against innocents. Although thrilled by the misery their mortal pawns inflict, the demons' true comfort is to harvest the souls of those pawns as more of their kind.

* * *

When a sinful mortal soul is judged and sent on to the Outer Rifts, it can become a deadly fiend—a demon. Demons are living incarnations of sin—be they classic sins like wrath or gluttony, or more "specialized" depravities like an obsession with torture or the act of treason or treachery. Once formed, a demon's driving goals are twofold—the amassing of personal power, and the corruption of mortal souls to cause them to become tainted by sin. In this way demons ensure a never-ending supply of new demons to bolster their ever-growing ranks in the Outer Rifts.

Demons are selfish and self-absorbed creatures, and most firmly believe that mortals only play at being more virtuous than fiends. They enjoy tempting mortals into damnation to both indulge their egos and swell their armies. Like many other fiends, one of the great rewards of this manipulation is fulfilling their hunger for souls. In their eyes, the primary use for these souls is to spawn new demons, who can serve as soldiers, slaves, pawns, or even currency for their more powerful masters.
