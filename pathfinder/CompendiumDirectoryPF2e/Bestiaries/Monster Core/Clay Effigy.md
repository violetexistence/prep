Traditionally, clay effigies are crafted in the image of a deity and used as guardians of tombs or sacred crypts. Clay effigies have the power to lay curses upon their victims as punishment for intrusion, leading many to believe that these oft-ancient constructs have a touch of the divine in them. Out of an abundance of caution, superstitious folk still tread lightly around elaborate or particularly well-crafted statues that resemble clay effigies even in the slightest.

For some clay effigies, this divine protection goes deeper. Even though deities rarely have the time to monitor their effigies, lesser divine servants are sometimes tasked with watching over an effigy. When the effigy is damaged, these guardians can sense it. The most precious effigies are layered with rituals that summon their guardians directly. Experienced tomb robbers learn to spot such markings from afar, so as to be forewarned of any divine interference in the area.

Although often assigned to protect valuable religious relics and other treasure, clay effigies' size and heavy movements make them ill-suited to stand guard among fragile items. Entire treasuries have been totally ruined by clumsy battles, so crafters do well to make sure their treasures are secured in sturdy containersâ€”or otherwise place the effigy on the other side of the door from the treasures they wish to protect.
