Rune giants are tyrants among their own kind, given power to command and magically control other giants. They once served even more powerful masters—potent wizards known as runelords—and in so doing, commanded entire armies of giants in service to the runelords' empires.

In the eons since these empires collapsed, rune giants have persisted, though to the outside world they're little more than fabled horrors. Rune giants usually dwell in the most remote and rugged of towering mountain ranges, but they can also be found in immense ruins atop lost islands, glacial valleys, or even more remote or magical regions.

Dozens of runes decorate rune giants' striking charcoal flesh. They are towering creatures, averaging at 40 feet in height and weighing 25,000 pounds.

Giants are massive humanoid creatures who live in remote regions throughout the world. They vary widely but are united in their hunger, requiring sustenance of their own element along with the feasts one would expect from such a massive humanoid. Although a simple matter for some giants, more esoteric types find this need a harsh reality. While a massive fistful of ice or snow alongside their meal will satisfy a frost giant, shadow giants hunger for the coagulated shadows of the Netherworld.
