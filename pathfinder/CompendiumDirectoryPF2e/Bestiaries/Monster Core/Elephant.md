Those who live near elephants have learned to be wary of angering the beasts, but even with precautions in place, elephants sometimes still rampage. There is little an individual person can do when even a single elephant becomes enraged. Furthermore, a herd of angry or frightened elephants can easily destroy an entire village.

Immediately recognizable by their long, prehensile trunks and impressive tusks, elephants have different characteristics depending on where they are found. Elephants are used as beasts of burden in many regions, but they are extremely clever and must be handled with great care.
