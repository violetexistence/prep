The brutish and gluttonous augnagar live to feast—preferably on rotten flesh and, when possible, demon flesh. But to them, the greatest delicacy is the flesh of other augnagars. Augnagars have swollen, spiderlike legs with leathery membranes like a bat's wings, and three tails ending in hooked stings perfect for slicing flesh.

An augnagar that gorges sufficiently, especially on other augnagars, can grow so massive it can't even move, thrashing and festering where it lies. It eventually flies into a frenzy of self-cannibalism as it rips apart its own flesh to feast on. From the ruinous remains emerges a thulgant—a smaller but more powerful qlippoth.

* * *

Long before the creatures known as demons came to be the dominant force in the Outer Rifts, qlippoth ruled the innumerable cracks of the Outer Sphere. These inimical creatures are a form of primordial and alien evil that predates mortal life, and most immortal life as well. Since the rise of mortal sin and the associated expansion of demonic life through the Outer Rifts, qlippoth have been driven to their deepest reaches, and they seethe with rancor at the loss of their realms. Yet, rather than directly oppose demons, qlippoth instead turn to the source—mortal sin—and wage an endless war to eradicate all creatures capable of sinful acts so that the demonic tide might be turned back. To ensure they do not bolster their foe's ranks, they enact horrific transformations on their targets, converting their victims into beings incapable of discerning right from wrong; this renders them unable to be judged by Pharasma's courts and thus incapable of becoming fiends. Most mortals consider the ministrations of a qlippoth to be far worse than any fate awaiting them in the afterlife.
