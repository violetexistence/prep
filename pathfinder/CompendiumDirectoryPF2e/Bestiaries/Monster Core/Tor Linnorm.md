Tor linnorms dwell in the tallest volcanic mountains, either within naturally formed caverns or molten craters. A tor linnorm's temper can be as hot and destructive as the magma the creature resembles.

* * *

Immense, primeval dragons of the northern reaches of the world, linnorms hate those they deem to be lesser creatures and seek to inflict as much suffering as possible upon their unfortunate victims. While these serpentine monstrosities might not be the powerful winged dragons most imagine, they nonetheless possess incredible strength and deadly powers that often rival more notorious dragons' brutality.
