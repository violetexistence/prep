    desc: "  Tremorsense allows a monster to feel the vibrations through a solid surface caused by movement. It is an imprecise sense with a limited range (listed in the ability).

Stubborn and ponderous, elemental avalanches are massive beings of living rock and dirt. Once their ire is raised, they will take the shortest route to resolving the problem, usually by burying it in rock.

Earth elementals make excellent bodyguards for adventuresome spelunkers and are ideal protectors of important subterranean locations such as vaults and treasuries.
