Choral angels are incredible singers who fill the halls of Nirvana with pious chants and sacred hymns. Most form from the souls of talented bards and other performers, though anyone who takes superlative joy in music might ascend to their ranks. Though their duties are typically to spread peace and joy through their music, their holy incantations also brim with mystic purpose, their songs bolstering angelic wards and strengthening the very fabric of the celestial planes themselves.

While choral angels shy away from conflict, they will brave the mortal realm to deliver good omens and auspicious messages. Choral angels often serve the goddess Shelyn, but they can also serve other good deities and empyreal lords.

The celestial hosts of angels are messengers and warriors, divided into choirs based on their abilities and purviews. Angels were one of the first creations of the gods, and many still assist their righteous creators throughout the cosmos. Most angels in modern times are not direct creations of the divine, however, instead consisting of ascended mortal souls drawn from the celestial planes.

The majority of unaffiliated angels live in Nirvana, the plane of virtue and enlightenment. Angels who are affiliated with deities dwell in those deities' domains or other areas where that god holds influence. Regardless of residence or service, angels remain benevolent messengers possessed with magical auras to aid their allies.
