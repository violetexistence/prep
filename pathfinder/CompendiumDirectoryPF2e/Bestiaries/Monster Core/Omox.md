Seemingly made from living, animated filth, omoxes have no true anatomy, although they generally spend most of their time in roughly humanoid shapes, resembling some grim caricatures of half-melted humanoids. While scholars once believed these foul demons to be a pure, concentrated form of the corruption that suffuses the Outer Rifts and its inhabitants, in truth these demons arise from the souls of those who routinely befouled and polluted their surroundings in life.

* * *

When a sinful mortal soul is judged and sent on to the Outer Rifts, it can become a deadly fiend—a demon. Demons are living incarnations of sin—be they classic sins like wrath or gluttony, or more "specialized" depravities like an obsession with torture or the act of treason or treachery. Once formed, a demon's driving goals are twofold—the amassing of personal power, and the corruption of mortal souls to cause them to become tainted by sin. In this way demons ensure a never-ending supply of new demons to bolster their ever-growing ranks in the Outer Rifts.

Demons are selfish and self-absorbed creatures, and most firmly believe that mortals only play at being more virtuous than fiends. They enjoy tempting mortals into damnation to both indulge their egos and swell their armies. Like many other fiends, one of the great rewards of this manipulation is fulfilling their hunger for souls. In their eyes, the primary use for these souls is to spawn new demons, who can serve as soldiers, slaves, pawns, or even currency for their more powerful masters.
