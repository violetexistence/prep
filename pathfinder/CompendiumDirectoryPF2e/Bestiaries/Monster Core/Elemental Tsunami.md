Elemental tsunamis are huge and destructive, having none of the caring or nurturing aspects of water.

Water elementals can be very destructive, but often not intentionally so; just as water can bring life to mortals in need, its waves can pound shores and rains can flood cities. Water elementals are similarly difficult to predict.
