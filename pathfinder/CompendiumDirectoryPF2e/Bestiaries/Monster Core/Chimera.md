The chimera is the archetypal example of an unnatural monster made up of a monstrous mix of wildly different component creatures: in this case, a lion, a dragon, and a goat. Wild, hateful, and hungry, it tries to eat any creature it sees, but sometimes a strong-willed master is able to compel a chimera to serve as a guardian or even a mount. If such an individual ever loses their control over the chimera, they are often the first to be devoured.
