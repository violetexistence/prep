When an army of devils invades to bathe a region in bloodshed and hellfire, it is likely that one of the nessaris masterminded the incursion. Cunning, powerful, and ruthless, nessaris often serve the archdevils directly. They rule infernal duchies, subjugate mortal worlds, and usurp infernal rivals using unparalleled despotism and calculated ferocity. To realize their tyrannical machinations, nessaris claim mortal souls that they corrupt into ort servants, which can then be shaped and transformed through infernal manipulation into the terrifying devils that form Hell's formidable legions. They often select the most wicked and vicious orts for their armies, drawing upon these lesser devils' depravity during powerful magical ceremonies to create hideous and terrifying abominations that can cow and eviscerate the nessari's enemies.

Each nessari is crafted deep within the nightmarish bowels of Nessus, the ninth layer of Hell, to serve the whims of archdevils and infernal dukes. Those nessaris that don't leave Nessus to command infernal legions in the upper layers of Hell often form the courts of Hell's elite, gathering cronies and sects that shape Hell's political landscape through subterfuge and manipulation. But many nessaris see themselves as living embodiments of hellfire, the all-encompassing wrath of Hell, and thus prefer to dwell in realms consumed by fire. In Avernus, Dis, Malebolge, Nessus, and Phlegethon, nessaris build vast citadels of brimstone wreathed in flame to lord over.

Rather than being above the constant power struggles of the diabolic ranks, nessaris are in the thick of it. Even apocalyptic schemes to conquer or despoil mortal worlds usually begin from a desire to claw a single rank up the immortal hierarchy of Hell. For this reason, the best, yet also most dangerous, ally against a nessari is the nessari next to them.

Nessaris tower over other devils, standing at least 16 feet tall, weighing over 1,000 pounds, and brandishing wingspans in excess of 20 feet.

## Infernal Dukes

Elite members of Hell's political infrastructure and leadership hierarchy, the dukes of Hell are chosen from among the most tyrannical, oppressive, and conniving devils. While not all infernal dukes are nessaris, a nessari's natural disposition toward conquest and oppression often makes them an ideal candidate for this position. To create an infernal duke, adjust the nessari to be between 21st and 25th level. Because of their physical prowess, manipulative nature, and powerful spellcasting abilities, infernal dukes make excellent villains for long-running campaigns.

* * *

Masters of corruption and architects of conquest, devils seek both to tempt mortal life to join in their pursuit of all things profane and to spread tyranny throughout all worlds. The temptations they offer mortals range from great powers granted by the signing of an infernal contract to twisted favors following a whispered pledge to a diabolic patron, or any number of even subtler exchanges. Those who succumb to these temptations find themselves consigned to an afterlife of endless torment in the pits of Hell, wherein the only hope of escape lies in the chance of being promoted to become a devil in the infernal ranks.

Every devil has a specific role to play in the upkeep of the remorseless bureaucratic machine that is Hell, from soldiers and scholars to inquisitors, lawyers, judges, and executioners. Lowly orts perform subservient labor to more powerful and specialized devils, such as infantry and contract devils, while the greatest nessaris command entire infernal armies.

Asmodeus stands at the apex of the structure he created, but the layers below him are marked by a constant jockeying for position. Most diabolic plans ultimately serve to improve the schemer's place in the hierarchy.
