Tigers are solitary and territorial hunters, using their striped hides to blend into the forests and jungles they call home and preferring to attack with surprise.

Few predators of the natural world can match the cat's talent for stalking and stealth. Large cats can be found in almost any environment, usually keeping their distance from settlements. When civilization encroaches onto a big cat's hunting grounds, the animals are often driven to making desperate attacks against unwary travelers.
