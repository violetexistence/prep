The bottlenose dolphin is the most common and widespread species of dolphin. They are social predators who hunt shallow seas and rivers in large family groups called pods. Sailors are fond of bottlenose dolphins and frequently tell of how they've saved drowning mariners or protected crew from sharks with blows from their powerful snouts.

Dolphins encompass a wide range of aquatic mammals, all of which are social, intelligent, and widespread throughout the world's oceans.
