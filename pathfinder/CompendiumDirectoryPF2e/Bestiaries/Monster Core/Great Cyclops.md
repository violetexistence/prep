Gigantic loners, the great cyclopes are their lesser kin writ large. They're stronger and more violent, but their uncontrolled vision of possible futures has driven them beyond reason. They see every moment as a potential storm of uncontrollable fury and, out of a desperate desire for peace, quiet, and an end to their hunger, lash out at any who come near. Wise creatures avoid great cyclopes at all cost. It's fortunate for humanoids that great cyclopes prefer to dwell far from settlements.

Debate has long raged over the origins of these massive, destructive giants. They are so large that it had long been assumed they were used as beasts of burden by their lesser kin, now free to hunt and kill without restraint. Other scholars believe the great cyclops is the ultimate fate of the entire cyclops species. Whatever foolish decision or wayward curse caused the end of their civilization is still playing out, occasionally causing a cyclops to withdraw from their own kind, lose all semblance of intellect, and mutate into a lumbering, feral colossus.

* * *

The cyclopes are violent giants with a tragic past. Although they possess only one eye, they could once see far more than most, possessing occult wisdom and divinatory magic that gave them the mystic ability of foresight. But their legendary oracular powers failed to prevent the fall of their society, and the vast kingdoms of the cyclops long ago collapsed into ruin. Today, cyclopes have forgotten much of what they once knew, and they skulk among the crumbling remains of their fallen cities like forgotten kings and queens of their own fallen kingdoms.
