The gosreg's unsettled aura extends to 60 feet, and it blocks all other creatures' telepathy in the aura. Its Mind Bolt can also affect any number of targets in 60 feet. These effects end when the gosreg uses its claw Strike, leaves its space, or is knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Change Shape|Change Shape]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,occult,polymorph) The gosreg takes on the appearance of any Small or Medium humanoid. This doesn't change its Speed or attack and damage modifiers with its claw, but it might change the damage type it deals (typically to bludgeoning). It cannot use its jaws Strike while in humanoid form.\n* * *\n\nThe monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

  - name: "Mind Bolt"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (mental,occult) A gosreg concentrates its field of discordant mental energy and projects it into the mind of one creature within 60 feet. The target takes 6d6 mental damage (`DC 30 Will check` save). On a critical failure, the creature is also [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]] for 1 minute or until it takes damage."

Gosregs are agents of the Dominion of the Black who insinuate themselves into humanoid societies to implement the goals of their sinister masters. They're generally tasked with observing and waiting, hiding in disguised forms until their location is ripe for harvest. When this occurs, they reveal themselves as living psychic beacons, signaling their distant masters and guiding invasion forces. Over the years of an infiltration, a gosreg will assume dozens of roles, relishing any intense emotions it can inspire while laying the groundwork for future identities.

In their natural form, gosregs dart about in a jerky gallop due to stumpy legs, gangly arms, and oversized heads. They take on the appearances of humanoids to infiltrate societies, and they drop these disguises only when they're compromised and must resort to physical violence to continue their mission.

The Dominion of the Black is a conglomeration of deep-space conquerors with a strong presence on Aucturn, the most remote planet in Golarion's solar system. The Dominion has secret outposts all over Golarion; most of its members on the planet are scouts, using their skills to steal brains and identities, gathering information without any consideration for the inhabitants of the worlds they infiltrate.
