Sinspawn were created by one of seven ancient wizards known collectively as runelordsâ€”each of whom embraced and embodied one of seven sins. The first sinspawn was created by the Runelord of Wrath, utilizing techniques that have since gone on to influence fleshwarping practices. It wasn't long before the technique used to create sinspawn fell into the hands of the other runelords, and while each tried their own hand at crafting variants of their own design, today, sinspawn of wrath remain the most numerous and notorious of their kind.

Bearing only a vague resemblance to the humanoids from whose flesh they were formed, sinspawn generally appear horrifically emaciated and have unnaturally long arms and digitigrade legs, each with a trio of stubby, taloned digits. Veins bulge across sinspawn's bodies in sanguine patterns that suspiciously resemble twisted runes, and their flesh is pale and hairless. Their heads are elongated, with slits for a nose, red eyes, and disturbing lower jaws that split in half at the chin, revealing pedipalps that end in tiny, three-fingered hands and framing a long, lolling tongue.

Sinspawn stand 6-1/2 feet tall and typically weigh as much as an emaciated human of their size. They behave in a manner consistent with their associated sin and have physical characteristics that hint at these qualities. For example, greedspawn's veins appear to run with gold, while envyspawn appear even more gaunt than the rest of their kin.
