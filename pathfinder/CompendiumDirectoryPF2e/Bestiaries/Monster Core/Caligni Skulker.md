Most often found on the surface are caligni skulkers, stealing staple goods and luxuries alike. When pressed into combat by more powerful caligni, skulkers will often be sacrificed in waves to wear down the enemy. Otherwise, skulkers are fairly cautious and prefer to flee unwinnable situations.

Calignis lurk in subterranean cities, with each caligni growing into a specific role and form determined by supernatural influences in caligni society. Regardless of their size or role, all calignis are gaunt, with pale flesh and white eyes. Many relish the chance to creep above ground at night to steal resources, shadow their surface counterparts, or simply make mischief.
