Irnakurse are believed to be elves who have been subjected to particularly cruel and humiliating fleshwarping practices, though they are so corrupted by their transformation it is nearly impossible to tell. The process of crafting an irnakurse twists the unfortunate elf into a mass of misplaced limbs, loose flesh, and bony protrusionsâ€”parts that should be internal are often left on full display to the world. These beings periodically crawl to the surface from the deepest reaches of the Darklands, leading some elven scholars to the gruesome suspicion that these are remnants of the elves who traveled underground in order to escape Earthfall.

Magical mishaps, divine curses, and untested technology are all capable of wreaking drastic transformations on the body, and are all rampant on the world of Golarion and beyond. Creatures that have undergone changes so drastic they no longer can be considered the same ancestry as they were before are known as fleshwarps. These beings are rare, and their unsettling appearance often provokes horrified responses from other people.

Some creatures revel in the total degradation of their defeated foes through fleshwarping. Though the technique was originally taught to mortals by the demon lord Haagenti, mortals have spent eons modifying and perfecting the method. Fleshcrafters torture their enemies in vats of churning magical reagents, reshaping their flesh and psyche alike into horrid and monstrous things.
