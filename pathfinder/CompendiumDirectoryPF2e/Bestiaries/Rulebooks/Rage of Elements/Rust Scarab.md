These elementals resemble enormous beetles, with thick outer shells composed of multiple layers of heavily pockmarked, rusted plates protecting a jagged metallic skeleton.

Metal elementals can manifest in a wide variety of different forms, from shapeless amalgams of different metals to humanoid and beast-like monstrosities.

## Metal Forms

Though metal elementals are made almost entirely of metal, most are composed of layers of different metals in tiny fragments, as complex as a body of flesh or plant matter. Many of these metals are rusted or decayed from the natural, slow entropy of the Plane of Metal.
