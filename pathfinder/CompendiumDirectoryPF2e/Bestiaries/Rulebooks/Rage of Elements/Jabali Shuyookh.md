Tremorsense functions only if the monster is on the same surface as the subject, and only if the subject is moving along (or burrowing through) the surface."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Change Shape|Change Shape]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (arcane,concentrate,polymorph) The jabali transforms into a Small or Medium earth elemental or land animal, typically a camel or dog. This doesn't affect the shuyookh's statistics, but it could change the damage type of their Strikes.\n* * *\n\nThe monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

    desc: " (downtime) **Frequency** three times per year\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The shuyookh conducts a wish ritual for the benefit of a mortal, requiring no cost or secondary casters. The shuyookh's result is a success if they succeed at a `DC 5 Flat check` or a failure if not. The shuyookh fulfills the wish in the most straightforward, simple way possible."

  - name: "Stone Clutch"
    desc: " (arcane,earth) When the jabali Pushes a creature into a stone barrier, the surface grips it with fingers of stone. The target must succeed at a `DC 30 Reflex check` save or become [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] by the surface ([[Actions/Escape|Escape]] DC 36)."

  - name: "Stone Crush"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (arcane,earth) The jabali deals 2d6+13 bludgeoning damage to all creatures within 100 feet that are [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] by stone clutch, with a `DC 32 Fortitude check` save."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Push|Push 15 feet]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** The monster's last action was a successful Strike that lists Push in its damage entry\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The monster attempts to [[Actions/Shove|Shove]] the creature. This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the monster's multiple attack penalty. If Push lists a distance, change the distance the creature is pushed on a success to that distance."

A jabali genie of great power and high social rank is called a shuyookh. Strong in body and mind, jabali shuyookhs value physical skill, fine artistry, and displays of strength. Incredibly proud, they're easily offended and quick to anger but lash out only after weighing the consequences. Shuyookhs view their desires as greater than those around them, leading them to provide aid as quickly and efficiently as possible, fulfilling the terms of bargains expediently and to the letter.

Jabali shuyookhs are industrious and have many interests, including athletic competitions, engineering, jewelry-making, masonry, metalworking, and sculpting. They enjoy games of chance and bargaining, whether in a gambling hall, arena, or marketplace. Some mix their interests by managing organizations or guilds involving such concerns. Many shuyookhs reap the wealth of the Plane of Earth for sale elsewhere and speculate on the value of such commodities.

## Industry Titans

The mercantile empires of jabali shuyookhs extend across the Plane of Earth and onto other planes. Jabalis especially like to trade in regions of the Universe and across the Plane of Fire. Many customers value gemstones, metals, and other precious materials mined on the Plane of Earth. Thus, the resources of the Plane of Earth feed industry across the planes.
