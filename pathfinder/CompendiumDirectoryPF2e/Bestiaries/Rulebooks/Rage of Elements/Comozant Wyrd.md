One creature the wyrd is empathically conversing with gains the benefits of an augury spell, though only about this conversation topic, rather than any topic of the creature's choice."

Buzzing, crackling plasma makes up a comozant wyrd, electrically charged waves of greens, blues, and purples cascading in heatless flame. Given a mind and a semblance of a face, comozant wyrds need a surface from which they can crackle and writhe. Once secure, they seek out companionship from anyone nearby. In the Universe, they can be found in many places: lashing themselves to sailing ships, dancing across the buildings, or anchoring to the stones of a mountain range. In the vast spans of the Plane of Air, however, comozant wyrds often come to feel extremely lonely. A lucky few become pets for jaathooms living in the plane's cities, but many wait on isolated floating islands for an airship they can attach to or, more tragically, strive vainly to reach a distant shore before sputtering out.

## Comozant Communication

Creatures of emotion and instinct, comozant wyrds use simple images and concepts to convey deep and layered meanings. They're quite insightful, able to leap to solid conclusions as rapidly as they leap across solid surfaces. Most who "converse" with a comozant wyrd find the process enlightening, but have little desire make it a regular experience.
