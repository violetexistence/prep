  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Change Shape|Change Shape]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (arcane,concentrate,polymorph) The shuyookh transforms into a Small or Medium fire elemental or reptile, such as a snake. This doesn't affect the shuyookh's statistics, but it could change the damage type of their Strikes.\n\nThe monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

  - name: "Combat Grab"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** The ifrit shuyookh has a hand free\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The shuyookh makes a melee Strike. If the Strike hits, the target is [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] in the shuyookh's free hand."

  - name: "Pedantic Wish"
    desc: " (downtime) **Frequency** three times per year\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The shuyookh conducts a wish ritual for the benefit of a mortal, requiring no cost or secondary casters. The shuyookh's result is a success if they succeed at a `DC 5 Flat check` or a failure if not. The shuyookh subverts the wish-maker's true intentions, twisting the phrasing to maximize suffering."

The leaders and luminaries of ifrits come from the wise but cruel shuyookhs. These spiteful manipulators lord their might over other genies and twist mortal greed into grief. Ifrit shuyookhs guide the Dominion of Flame with their vicious whims and unwavering belief in ifrit supremacy.

## Hot Gossip

Scion of the noble but disgraced Mishalq family, the ifrit information broker Qalkami Mishalq emerged from exile and returned to the Dominion of Flame following the death of Sultan Suleiman XXII. Qalkami used contacts in the Pathfinder Society to eliminate her rivals in the Cinderfury family and step into a power vacuum of her own creation, expanding her control and influence among the great nobility of Medina Mudii'a.
