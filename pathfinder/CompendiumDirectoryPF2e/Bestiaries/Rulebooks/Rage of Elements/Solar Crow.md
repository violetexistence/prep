These enormous three-legged elementals resemble crows with flaming feathers, said to shine as bright as the sun. They nest in the smoldering Forest of Mulberry Coals, living in flocks of eight to a dozen, with ten being the most common.

The ifrits of the Dominion of Flame conscript even more of the plane's fire elementals in preparation for new wars in the returned planes, even mobilizing ones that rarely travel near settlements.

## Story Of Infamy

Ancient tales from dragon-ruled Tian Xia tell of a flock of solar crows who wreaked havoc upon the Plane of Wood, driving an herb that could grant immortality to extinction before coming to terrorize Tian Xia itself. All but one of the crows were then shot down by a legendary archer.
