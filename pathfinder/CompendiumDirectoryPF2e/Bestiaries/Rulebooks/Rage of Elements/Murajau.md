Murajaus, one of many nomadic creatures of the Plane of Water, appear humanoid from the waist up but resemble a large hermit crab from the waist down, including a pair of strong pincers. Murajau communities are often multilingual, and many individuals are willing to work as translators and guides to adventurers if properly compensated. Rather than currency, murajaus prefer to deal in trinkets such as talismans, particularly those that protect travelers. For murajaus, such items signify their sincerity and unwavering desire to protect others. They trade tales among each other of treasure troves too dangerous to easily explore. Rather than keep this information solely for themselves, they're happy to share it with trustworthy people they meet in exchange for a small share.

Faydhaans tell condescending tales of murajaus, describing their origin as royal servants who failed to fulfill a royal decree. Murajaus' own creation story, meanwhile, claims that the royal decree in question requested they travel the lands to provide shelter and hospitality to visitors, a mission they have since carried on for generations. They take great pride in treating guests well, especially in providing suitable food, drink, and gifts.

To murajaus, one's shell signifies homestead, status, identity, and cultural inheritance. Community elders and leaders often wear shells passed down from a long line of successors, which carry modifications and marks that denote predecessors' achievements and failures. On the occasion that their community numbers exceed the number of shells available, a hunting season might be declared. Participants who return with suitable trophies are revered for their contribution and bravery.
