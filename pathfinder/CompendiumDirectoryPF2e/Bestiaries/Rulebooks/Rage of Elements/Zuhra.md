    desc: "`pf2:1` (arcane,concentrate,polymorph) The zuhra transforms into a Small or Medium metal elemental or animal. This doesn't affect the zuhra's statistics, but it could change the damage type of their Strikes.\n* * *\n\nThe monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

name: Zuhra
creatures:
  - 1: Zuhra
```



Zuhras, the genies of the elemental Plane of Metal, are bold and imposing, fond of being the center of attention and drawing a crowd with flashy performances, displays of skill, and tales of their personal victories. Despite their large personalities, their long-term relationships tend to be cool and somewhat distant; zuhras often make alliances but rarely form friendships, and the trust required for deeper relationships is rarer still. The few mortals who've gotten to know a zuhra often describe them as bombastic but emotionally aloof.

Since the reconnection with other planes, zuhras have sought out and formed bonds with other genies. They find their jabali cousins to be capable smithing partners, if a bit staid and dull. Zuhras rarely pay non-genie elementals any more than a passing glance, finding even the intelligent ones uninteresting to communicate with or hard to relate to.
