    desc: "`pf2:1` (arcane,concentrate,polymorph) The kizidhar transforms into a Small or Medium wood elemental or plant creature. This doesn't affect the kizidhar's statistics, but it could change the damage type of their Strikes.\n* * *\n\nThe monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

    desc: "`pf2:1`  The kizidhar creates a wooden item out of their body that appears in their hand and remains attached. The item can be a one-handed simple weapon, shield, or object of light Bulk. A kizidhar can instead use this ability to transform an item it's already holding or to remove an object to free its hand. Any item created with Sculpt Wood crumbles to splinters if removed from the kizidhar's possession."

  - name: "Take Root"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (arcane,plant,wood) The genie thrusts their weapon into the ground. Plants sprout and grow out of the ground in a 20-foot burst centered on one corner of the kizidhar's square. All squares on the ground in that area are difficult terrain until the kizidhar uses this ability again."

Kizidhars look like walking trees, averaging 10 to 12 feet tall with branches twisting to form their arms, faces, and other features. A kizidhar can reshape their body to create any wooden object.

The genies of the Plane of Wood, known as the kizidhars, are overbearing lords of their element. These master crafters of wood specialize in carpentry and all kinds of woodcarving, and they take a particular delight in reshaping the world in their own imageâ€”either through creating wooden statues of themselves or by manipulating and controlling the living things around them. Though they're able to carve themselves similarly, they usually regard their own forms as perfect.

Shunning the company of other genies, they prefer to avoid those equal in power and instead surround themselves with circles of sycophants and flatterers. With the pathways to the Universe open again for the first time in ages, kizidhars roam the multiverse to find mortals they can tempt into joining their palace retinues as servants, entertainers, and valuable sources of new information.
