Civilizations die, buried by time, but their memory may yet linger in shattered pottery, collapsed edifices, and destroyed artwork, compressed and clarified under the weight of rock and soil. Some excavated sites might still hold a sliver of consciousness in their base materials, which walks again as an avatar of an extinct people when awakened. These lithic loci represent the triumphs and folly of their society. Speaking to one is speaking to a witness of an archaic time. The lithic locus's persona expresses their culture in all dimensions, and thus the attitudes of lithic loci vary greatly. Their appearances show the aesthetics and technology of their time, suspended in a cloud of excavated earth.

As plentiful as archaeological sites are in the Universe, the Plane of Earth holds countless more of far older provenance. Some of its inhabitants have even found lithic loci from peoples far older than themselves, seeing directly what would remain should they dwindle out of living memory. This has led some civilizations to even plan their decline by leaving a legacy in the living rock.

## Ancient Finds

Lithic loci often contain important and valuable items. None of these elemental constructs are likely to agree to be looted, but some loci bestow their antiquities upon worthy successors, proud to see their culture's creations put to effective use in the modern day. Lithic loci can also direct earnest seekers to other lost treasures, helping to restore knowledge of an extinct society.
