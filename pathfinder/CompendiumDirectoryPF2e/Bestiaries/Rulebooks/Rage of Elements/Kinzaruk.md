This grants it the movement Speeds and Strikes of the chosen form, but none of the other benefits. Its attack bonus is unchanged, and its damage bonus is +3.

In its natural state, the kinzaruk resembles a paper-thin, perfectly square sheet of lightweight silvery-white metal, approximately 15 feet across. It's almost never encountered this form, however, being far better known for its ability to intricately fold its body thousands of times in an instant to reconfigure itself into a varied assortment of deadly animal-like shapes.

Metal elementals can manifest in a wide variety of different forms, from shapeless amalgams of different metals to humanoid and beast-like monstrosities.

## Metal Forms

Though metal elementals are made almost entirely of metal, most are composed of layers of different metals in tiny fragments, as complex as a body of flesh or plant matter. Many of these metals are rusted or decayed from the natural, slow entropy of the Plane of Metal.
