Each long, thin leg of a crystal strider is a single enormous crystal, typically quartz or selenite. The strider uses this panoply of legs and a fluctuating physical structure to rapidly move about crystalline caverns, unimpeded by terrain.

The vast ranks of earth elementals have been slow to respond to the return of the elemental lords and the Planes of Metal and Wood. These events have not broken the mountains, nor have they blown away the sands.

## Earthy Emotions

Earth elementals talk even less than most elementals. They're ponderous, weighing decisions so slowly they can crush the energy from a discussion. Their foremost concern is whether a situation can be endured. Though a rare or resplendent treasure might entice an earth elemental, it's difficult to spur any sense of urgency in them without the presence of an immediate threat.
