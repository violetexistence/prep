Often mistaken for air elementals due to their hazy, almost-imperceptible forms, a boiling spring is a humanoid water elemental made of scalding steam and bubbling water. When summoned to the Universe, a boiling spring raises the ambient temperature around them, making the surrounding climate humid and muggy. They seem to enjoy the discomfort they cause, though some regard it as merely a fun prank while others truly revel in the misery and look for ways to cause more.
