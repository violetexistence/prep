Melomachs are massive, vaguely humanoid elementals composed of metal debris. They take great pride in decorating and augmenting their metallic bodies with haphazardly placed spikes, blades, humanoid or bestial skulls, and other similar adornments, the more ostentatious the better. When two melomachs meet, the resulting contests of physical might and vocal prowess can last for days, often leaving the landscape ravaged for miles in every direction.
