    desc: "`pf2:1` (plant) The pine pangolin secretes a brown, sticky tar within a 5-foot emanation, making those squares difficult terrain for 1 minute. Each creature that enters or starts its turn in a tarred square must succeed at a `DC 25 Fortitude check` save or become [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] until it Escapes. On a critical failure, the creature falls [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]; prone creatures take a â€“2 circumstance penalty to their checks to [[Actions/Escape|Escape]] the tar. The pine pangolin is immune to the effects of its own tar."

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

These creatures sleep while hanging upside down by their partially curled tails and rely on their thick wooden scales to protect them from danger. One such danger the scales negate is the falling damage from deliberately rolling up and dropping onto the head of an unsuspecting opponent, which is one of their favorite combat strategies. Beneath their scales, pine pangolin bodies secrete a thick, sticky tar that serves as a secondary line of defense.
