    desc: "  When a nightwood guardian takes fire damage, they become enraged. The guardian gains 15 temporary Hit Points, deals 2 additional damage with melee Strikes, and has a –1 penalty to AC. They can't Raise their Shield or use actions with the concentrate trait except for [[Actions/Seek|Seek]].

This ends once the guardian has 100 HP or more, though they can choose to stay in this form indefinitely."

The nightwoods are parts of the Plane of Wood permanently bathed in darkness due to an absence of fluorescent plants. Here, the flora and fauna require darkness, not light, to thrive. Troll-like creatures known as nightwood guardians patrol these woods to ensure they remain in perpetual shadow. Considering themselves righteous gardens, they care little for the excuses of anyone else—intruders or residents. The guardians absolutely loathe the light, though it doesn't harm them as it does some varieties of creatures. Though wary of both light and any interloping lifeforms in their natural habitat, a nightwood guardian's fear turns easily to wrath, making the guardian a force of fury who seeks to drive out intruders.
