Despairing palls are small, dark clouds that float aimlessly through the Plane of Air, casting literal and emotional shadows wherever they go. Pranksters and mischievous elementalists often summon them to rain on a rival's parade.

* * *

Many elementals that roam the Plane of Air embody the mercurial formlessness and chaos of tumultuous storms.

## Tempestuous Spirits

Air elementals are often flighty contrarians, often more concerned with bringing about change than with the specific changes they enact. Art and writing created by such elementals is exceptionally rare, as they usually destroy their projects once the challenge and excitement of completing them fades.

## Invisible Courtiers

Formless and invisible elementals are the favored children of Hshurha, the air elementals' mother goddess. They receive favorable treatment in her realm, Verglas Precessional, where they serve as trusted advisors, emissaries to other planes, and members of her personal retinue, in addition to performing clandestine tasks the goddess wishes to keep hidden.
