    desc: "`pf2:1` (arcane,concentrate,polymorph) The gennayn transforms into a Tiny elemental or animal. This doesn't affect the gennayn's statistics, but it could change the damage type of their Strikes.\n* * *\n\nThe monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

Gennayns are minor genies who often serve as emissaries and messengers for greater elemental beings. While many find purpose in this humble mission, their true calling and interest is in the arts.

They often appear as miniature, athletic humanoids with wisps of elemental energy continually dissipating from their bodies. These elemental energies often reflect their emotions and attuned element. Gennayns are also fond of ostentatious rings, amulets, and armbands.

Gennayns eagerly assist powerful beings who reward and treat them well, but they're just as quick to abandon those they consider boring, stingy, or abusive. Beings who destroy artwork or mistreat artists will earn their eternal wrath.
