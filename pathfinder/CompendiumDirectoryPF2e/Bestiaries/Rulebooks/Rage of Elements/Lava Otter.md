These fiery otters frolic and hunt in the lava streams of the Planes of Fire. They're known to be highly territorial, instigating fights with rival otter families to compete for territory. Cautiously curious of strangers, entire packs have been known to descend upon anyone who attacks or event accidentally threatens a family member.

The ifrits of the Dominion of Flame conscript even more of the plane's fire elementals in preparation for new wars in the returned planes, even mobilizing ones that rarely travel near settlements.

## Familiar Poaching

Many greedy fire wizards wish to domesticate lava otters to act as their familiars, a sentiment loathed by most denizens of the Plane of Fire. While the otters' burning pelts serve as a deterrence for would-be poachers, numerous naari (fire geniekin) still take it upon themselves to patrol lava otter habitats to protect them from poaching.
