A skymetal striker resembles a serpent—or, more precisely, the two-headed serpent known as an amphisbaena—made of a long string of dozens of spinning, sharp- toothed circular saw blades. These blades array themselves along the creature's body like beads on an invisible cord of magnetic force. Although the blades making up the creature are typically composed of many different metals and alloys, it is best known, feared, and named for the blades of orichalcum and inubrix that form the "heads" at either end of its serpentine body.

Metal elementals can manifest in a wide variety of different forms, from shapeless amalgams of different metals to humanoid and beast-like monstrosities.

## Metal Forms

Though metal elementals are made almost entirely of metal, most are composed of layers of different metals in tiny fragments, as complex as a body of flesh or plant matter. Many of these metals are rusted or decayed from the natural, slow entropy of the Plane of Metal.

## Strange Metals

Inubrix and orichalcum are types of skymetal—a collective term used in the Universe to refer to exceedingly rare metals, most possessing magical properties, found on distant planets and fallen stars. Skymetal can be found in abundance on the Plane of Metal, however, and many metal elementals contain at least a bit of one type or another. Inubrix, colloquially called ghost iron, is prized for its ability to phase through other metals, while orichalcum's mystical properties can warp the very flow of time around it.
