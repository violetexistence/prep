    desc: " (aura,plant,primal,wood) 40 feet.\n\nThe lantern carried by the twins of rowan contains pure elemental life energy that resonates with and empowers all wood elementals. While within the emanation, a creature with the elemental trait and either the plant trait or wood trait gains fast healing 10 and a +2 circumstance bonus to all attack and damage rolls. The aura can be counteracted with a DC 30 check to [[Spells/Dispel Magic|Dispel Magic]]; doing so deactivates the aura for 1d6 rounds"

Twins of rowan are among the most powerful elementals on the Plane of Wood, specially crafted to patrol a wide range of wilderness and maintain the plane's carefully constructed order. Despite having two heads and torsos, each twins of rowan is a singular creature; like all wood elementals, their true consciousness is not in their heads but in the roots, and their true body is the trunk of the tree, not the extended limbs.
