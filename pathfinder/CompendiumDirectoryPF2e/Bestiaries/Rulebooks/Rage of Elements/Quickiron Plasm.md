  - name: "Djezet Extraction"
    desc: "  When a quickiron plasm dies, most of the djezet making up its body becomes inert and useless. However, a skilled alchemist can sometimes extract trace amounts of the valuable skymetal from its remains. This is a 10-minute process that requires the Alchemical Crafting feat, a proficiency rank of expert or better in Crafting, and a successful `DC 20 Crafting check` check. A successful attempt produces a single djezet dose that remains potent for 1 hour before breaking down into a foul-smelling goo. The item has no value if sold due to its temporary nature."

Looking much like an ooze, a quickiron plasm is a mass of the rust-red liquid skymetal known as djezet, prized in the Universe for its magic-enhancing properties. Quickiron plasms feed on the residual energies left behind by large expenditures of magical power, which they can detect from miles away.

Metal elementals can manifest in a wide variety of different forms, from shapeless amalgams of different metals to humanoid and beast-like monstrosities.

## Metal Forms

Though metal elementals are made almost entirely of metal, most are composed of layers of different metals in tiny fragments, as complex as a body of flesh or plant matter. Many of these metals are rusted or decayed from the natural, slow entropy of the Plane of Metal.
