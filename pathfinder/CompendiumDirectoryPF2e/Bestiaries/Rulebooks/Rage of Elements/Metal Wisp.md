Allies within 30 feet that have benefited from the wisp's resonance in the last hour gain temporary Hit Points equal to half the wisp's current Hit Points. These temporary Hit Points last 1 hour.\n\nA wisp that uses this reaction is permanently destroyed, and it can be restored only by a [[Spells/Wish|Wish]] ritual or similarly powerful effect. If an ability would prevent the wisp's destruction (for instance, if the wisp is summoned and would merely be dismissed), Accord Essence has no effect."

A metal wisp is a roiling sphere of rust particles and sharp metal fragments, all furiously orbiting a liquid metal core that resembles the skull of a mortal creatureâ€”usually a humanoid, but animal and even more fantastical skulls are not uncommon. They don't form attachments as easily as wisps from other elemental planes, which tend to view metal wisps as too morose, although they retain a certain curiosity since their return from the planar severance.
