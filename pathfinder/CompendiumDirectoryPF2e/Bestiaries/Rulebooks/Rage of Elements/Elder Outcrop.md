An outcrop of dense stone that spends ages eroding can gain sapience and slowly awaken with the wisdom of nature. Such elemental beings are slow to action and difficult to anger, spurred only by immediate threats.

* * *

The vast ranks of earth elementals have been slow to respond to the return of the elemental lords and the Planes of Metal and Wood. These events have not broken the mountains, nor have they blown away the sands.

## Earthy Emotions

Earth elementals talk even less than most elementals. They're ponderous, weighing decisions so slowly they can crush the energy from a discussion. Their foremost concern is whether a situation can be endured. Though a rare or resplendent treasure might entice an earth elemental, it's difficult to spur any sense of urgency in them without the presence of an immediate threat.

## Wisdom Of Stone

Elder outcrops learn a lesson for every grain of rock eroded away, every squall and freeze that has shaped their craggy bodies. As wizened advisors and tutors, they have the respect and affection of other elementals, as well as from natural creatures. Druids of the stone order revere the wisdom of elder outcrops, always happy to receive their wide perspective, literal and philosophical.
