  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Change Shape|Change Shape]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,polymorph) The monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

  - name: "Hurricane Blast"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (air,arcane) **Frequency** once per round\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The jaathoom moves all creatures without the air trait in their turbulent skies aura 20 feet directly away, clockwise, or counterclockwise. A creature avoids being moved if it succeeds at a `DC 29 Fortitude check` save."

  - name: "Impressive Wish"
    desc: " (downtime) **Frequency** three times per year\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The shuyookh conducts a wish ritual for the benefit of a mortal, requiring no cost or secondary casters. The shuyookh's result is a success if they succeed at a `DC 5 Flat check` or a failure if not. The shuyookh's visions of the subject's future inform how it interprets the wish."

  - name: "Ominous Dreams"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (mental,prediction) The jaathoom sends a prophetic dream into the mind of a sleeping creature within 60 feet. An unwilling creature can avoid the vision if it succeeds at a `DC 32 Will check` save. The jaathoom chooses the dream's subject but not its exact events. The target sees a brief vision of its future related to that subject, with the effect of augury. If the result is bad or mixed, the creature is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] and doesn't start to recover from being frightened until it wakes."
