When any other creature in the aura acts hostile, it must attempt a `DC 35 Will check` save.

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Change Shape|Change Shape]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (arcane,concentrate,polymorph) The monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block.\n* * *\n\nThe faydhaan transforms into a Small or Medium water elemental, aquatic animal, or humanoid. This doesn't affect the faydhaan's statistics, but it could change the damage type of their Strikes."

The shuyookh's result is a success if they succeed at a `DC 5 Flat check` or a failure if not. The shuyookh interprets the wish to please the most people possible."

  - name: "To the Hilt"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  The faydhaan shuyookh makes a melee _jambiya_ Strike and buries the blade deep, dealing an extra 3d6 persistent bleed damage on a hit (6d6 on a critical hit)."

Faydhaan shuyookhs are powerful faydhaans venerated as leaders, diplomats, and negotiators. As representatives of faydhaan-kind, they observe strict rules of etiquette and hospitality and hold the literary and performing arts in high esteem. A faydhaan shuyookh takes delight in greeting guests, and being greeted in return, to see how many different greetings they can demonstrate. Guests who creatively engage in this customary greeting game will impress a faydhaan shuyookh and receive magnificent hospitality.
