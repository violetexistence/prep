Vegetable lambs are gaining popularity as the first elemental to be summoned by spellcasters in training, as they're docile until provoked and easy to control. Casters must take care, however, to not let them germinate in the Universe; they're a highly invasive species that can devour an entire forest within a decade.

The healing and nourishing food that grows from vegetable lambs is appealing for adventurers and sedentary magical scholars alike. The taste is similar to the plants of the same kind that grow on Golarion, but not entirely. Many have noted that there's a slight similarity to meatâ€”a bit of umami one wouldn't find in an ordinary flower.
