Munsahirs build militaristic, traditional societies.

## Munsahir Hierarchy

The three strata of munsahir society can be observed in the kilts worn by all members. Nobles, the unimpeachable rulers, wear elaborate brass kilts. In the middle of society are businesspeople and traders bedecked in bronze. Raw copper adorns those in the working class, who do most of the building and hard labor for munsahir society. Officially speaking, there is no class mobility; horrible crimes might cause a brass noble to be sent to prison but can't cause them to lose their station.
