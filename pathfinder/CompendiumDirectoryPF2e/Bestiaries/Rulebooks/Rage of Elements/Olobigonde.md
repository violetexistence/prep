Though the Plane of Water is mostly liquid, it does contain its share of solid material, whether in the form of free-floating aquatic plants, hunks of coral, or even detritus from lost underwater cities. Flotsam and jetsam collect across the plane, and olobigondes are just one of the many creatures that have evolved to live among and consume this detritus. These flat, round fish are covered in a moss-like skin that makes them exceptionally difficult to spot as they hug the sides of flotsam, feeding off the waste that drifts into their wide, open mouths.

While olobigondes are primarily detritivores, they've been known to lie in wait within a forest of kelp or against a mossy stone to ambush smaller creatures, such as water scamps or lone passing merfolk. The fish launch themselves from their hiding spot to take large bites out of their surprised prey, then grab the victim as it tries to flee. Despite their size and ungainly shape, olobigondes can move quickly in water, though their bursts of speed are usually short-lived. In addition to maintaining a firm hold on prey, olobigondes' mouths are filled with a unique toxin that weakens and decomposes living flesh. The hungry fish easily gulp down the resulting slurry.

Ancient olobigondes grow truly immense, and their outward appearance evolves. There seems to be no limit to their size. Their skin even separates into plates with deep channels where water can accumulate, giving them the appearance of an entire patch of detritus rather than one piece.

Alchemists who travel the planes have discovered how readily an olobigonde's toxin can decompose flesh, and some have discovered ways to incorporate it into their creations. An olobigonde's corpse yields approximately 1 gp worth of raw materials when harvested with a successful `DC 16 Crafting check` or Survival check (2 gp worth on a critical success). This material can be used only to craft alchemical bombs with the poison trait.
