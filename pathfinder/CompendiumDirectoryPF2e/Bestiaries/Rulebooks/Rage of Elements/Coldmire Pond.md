Coldmire ponds are often mistaken for shallow pools of water, but these sentient bodies of living water actually crawl along the ground or float through other liquids. Coldmires are dangerous ambush predators, drowning creatures that stray too close to or, even more hazardously, stand or swim inside their waters.
