For ogres, the biggest, strongest, and most violent among them are the ones who claim the right to lead. When such a creature gains mythic power, its cruelty is likely to be matched only by its immense durability. Mythic ogre bosses are capable of felling even mighty and enormous prey like gigantic dinosaurs with their ogre hooks, using preposterously unbelievable strength to drag them down and rend them asunder. If a group of mythic ogre bosses were to band together, they could prove a terrifying threat, conquering villages or even a small city with relative ease. Fortunately, their philosophies of violence and strength over all else means that whenever such beings come into contact, they are far more likely to immediately war with each other to prove who is the strongest.
