    desc: "  This monster regains the listed number of Hit Points each round at the beginning of its turn. Its [[Conditions/Dying|Dying]] condition never increases beyond Dying 3 as long as its regeneration is active. However, if it takes damage of a type listed in the regeneration entry, its regeneration deactivates until the end of its next turn. Deactivate the regeneration before applying any damage of a listed type, since that damage might kill the monster by bringing it to Dying 4."

  - name: "[[Creature Family Ability Glossary/(Mythic) Mythic Resilience|Mythic Resilience]]"
    desc: "  The Oliphaunt treats its saving throws with the associated save as one step better than they actually are (so a critical failure is a failure, a failure is a success, and a success is a critical success). The first time each round that a character rolls a critical hit against the Oliphaunt, they must reroll the attack roll and take the new result."

    desc: "`pf2:r`  **Trigger** A creature within the monster's reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The monster attempts a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, the monster disrupts that action. This Strike doesn't count toward the monster's multiple attack penalty, and its multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike."

    desc: "`pf2:2`  **Cost** 1 Mythic Point\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The Oliphaunt of Jandelay buries its tusks into the ground in a 15-foot burst centered within 20 feet of it, collecting everything in that area, including any creature currently [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] by its tusk attack, and flinging it all up to 120 feet away. Everything lands in a 30-foot burst, dealing 12d6 bludgeoning damage to each creature in the area (`DC 51 Reflex check` save). This damage also applies to any creatures, vehicles, or objects the Oliphaunt flung as well. A creature in the area being flung that succeeds or critically succeeds on their Reflex save remains in the square they started in.

The monster can attempt to Trample the same creature only once in a single use of Trample.

  - name: "Trumpeting Blast"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (sonic) The Oliphaunt of Jandelay emits a cacophonous blast from its trunk in a 120-foot cone. Each creature in the area must attempt a `DC 49 Fortitude check` save. If the Oliphaunt spends 1 Mythic Point as part of the activity, the DC becomes 51 and the damage dice are increased to d12s. The Oliphaunt of Jandelay can't use Trumpeting Blast again for 1d4 rounds.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature takes 7d10 sonic damage and is [[Conditions/Deafened|Deafened]] for 1 round.\n\n**Failure** The creature takes 14d10 sonic damage, is [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] for 2 rounds, and is deafened for 2 rounds.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature takes 28d10 sonic damage, is [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 2]] for 2 rounds, and is deafened for 4 rounds."
