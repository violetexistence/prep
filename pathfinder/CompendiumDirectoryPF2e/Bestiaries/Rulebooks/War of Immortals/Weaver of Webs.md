    desc: " (scrying) The Weaver of Webs can see through the eyes of any spider, living or dead, in one of her many lairs. When the Weaver casts her [[Spells/Scrying|Scrying]] spell and targets a spider in her lair, the spell is not expended, and the spider automatically critically fails its saving throw."

As long as the creature is [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] by the Weaver's nightmare cocoon, it shares the Weaver's space and moves with her. The DC to [[Actions/escape dc=36|escape dc=36]]{Escape} the nightmare cocoon increases to 36."

    desc: "  This monster regains the listed number of Hit Points each round at the beginning of its turn. Its [[Conditions/Dying|Dying]] condition never increases beyond Dying 3 as long as its regeneration is active. However, if it takes damage of a type listed in the regeneration entry, its regeneration deactivates until the end of its next turn. Deactivate the regeneration before applying any damage of a listed type, since that damage might kill the monster by bringing it to Dying 4."

    desc: " (aura,mental) Any creature that speaks within this aura must succeed at a `DC 34 Will check` save or divulge some kind of secret instead of whatever speech they intended. Linguistic spells and effects gain the concentrate trait if they didn't have it already and are wasted if the creature fails this save.\n\nOn a critical failure, the character betrays a secret they least want to reveal to the Weaver or those present."

    desc: " (incapacitation,mental) A creature struck by the Weaver's web Strike must succeed at a `DC 34 Reflex check` save or become [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] ([[Actions/escape dc=34|escape dc=34]]). If the Weaver spends 1 Mythic Point as a free action when a creature fails this save, the creature is also [[Conditions/Paralyzed|Paralyzed]], experiencing terrible nightmares of their deepest-held anxieties. The Weaver can view these dreams using a Sustain action, which imparts a â€“2 circumstance penalty to any Will saves the target attempts against the Weaver's spells until the beginning of the Weaver's next turn. At the end of a paralyzed victim's turn, they can attempt a `DC 34 Will check` save to end the paralyzed condition (though they are still immobilized until they Escape)."
