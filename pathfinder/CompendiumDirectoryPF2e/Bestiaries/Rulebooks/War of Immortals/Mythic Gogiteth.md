Gogiteths are horrific nightmares with grasping, spiderlike legs; vicious, gnashing teeth; and far too many eyes. Of all the creatures on Golarion for whom the acquisition of mythic power might prove a nightmare for others, the gogiteth is arguably one of the most terrible.

Normally, a gogiteth's victims at least have the possible salvation of hearing the horrible crackling and popping of its joints as it clambers towards them through the dark, an opportunity to flee the slavering nightmare seeking them. Mythic ambusher gogiteths are unnaturally silent, however. The first sound a creature might hear when being hunted by such a monstrosity is the sharp wheeze of their own fleeting breath as the gogiteth's jaws snap shut around them, or the tearing of their flesh and clothing as one of its legs pierces them through.

Though little is known about the origins of gogiteths, mythic gogiteths generally acquire mythic power in the same way that other creatures do. Golarion has no shortage of vile deities who might take cruel delight in bestowing a sliver of mythic power upon a creature as frightful and terrible as a gogiteth. Their traditional hive homes in the Darklands make it unlikely that they would be affected by the Godsrain, but it is not impossible that droplets of Gorum's spilled blood could seep through cracks and make their way down into the thirsty jaws of one of these nightmarish monstrosities.
