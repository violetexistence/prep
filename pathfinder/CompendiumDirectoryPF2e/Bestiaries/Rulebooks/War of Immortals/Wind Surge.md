    desc: "`pf2:r` (air) **Trigger** Agyra flies overhead for at least 120 feet in a straight line\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Supernaturally powerful winds batter the area in a line that is 120 feet long and 30 feet wide and 30 feet tall. Each creature in the line must attempt a `DC 29 Reflex check` save. Moving above ground against the direction of the line is greater difficult terrain for 1 minute.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is pushed 10 feet along the line.\n\n**Success** The creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage and is pushed 15 along the line.\n\n**Failure** The creatures takes 10d6 bludgeoning damage, is pushed 30 feet along the line, and is knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]].\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature takes 20d6 bludgeoning damage, is pushed 45 feet along the line, is knocked prone, and is [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]] for 1 round.\n\nIf the line overlaps a body of water, the winds cause massive waves that deal 6d6 bludgeoning damage to creatures in the water or within 15 feet of the waterline (`DC 29 Reflex check` save). On a critical failure, a creature is also swept 30 feet away from the waterline and 15 feet beneath the water's surface."
