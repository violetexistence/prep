A mythic lich could be a lich who came into contact with a source of mythic power after their transformationâ€”or one whose transformation was designed to instill mythic power in them. Such rituals might entail using a mythic artifact as a soul cage, slaying a mythic creature, or luring a mythic being into striking the killing blow against the spellcaster. Among adherents of the Whispering Way, it is commonly believed that the Whispering Tyrant tricked the god Aroden into killing him as a mortal so he could siphon some of Aroden's power into creating his soul cage and allowing him to become a mythic lich.
