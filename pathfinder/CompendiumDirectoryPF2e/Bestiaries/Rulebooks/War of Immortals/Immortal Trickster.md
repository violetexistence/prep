He has little control over his sensory animals' actions, though they usually act in a way that is consistent with his desires unless they have a specific reason not to.

    desc: "`pf2:2` (mental,primal) **Frequency** once per day\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The Immortal Trickster forms a bond with a mortal creature. While the bond exists, the mortals bonded to the Immortal Trickster increase their current and maximum Hit Points by 10 and gain a +2 status bonus to their attack and damage rolls, as well as to skill checks they make using Deception, Stealth, or Thievery. The Immortal Trickster can communicate telepathically with any of his bonded mortals as long as both beings are on the same plane. Each week that they are bonded to the Trickster, the bonded mortals increase their doomed value by 1; their doomed value cannot be increased above 3 by this ability and their doomed value cannot decrease while they remain bonded to the Trickster. The Immortal Trickster can be bonded with up to six mortals at a time, and they can take this action again to end the bond or to form a new bond. The bond also ends if the mortal dies. Whenever one of his bonded mortals dies, the Immortal Trickster becomes [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]] or increases the value of his drained condition by 1, and the Trickster gains a +2 status bonus on the next attack roll or skill check he attempts."

In areas where another Tiny or Small animal is known for wiliness and trickery, the Immortal Trickster can assume that animal's shape instead. While transformed, the Immortal Trickster loses his innate spells, attacks, and special actions, but doesn't otherwise change his statistics and can still speak. In fox or coyote form, the Immortal Trickster's size changes to Tiny (for a fox) or Small (for a coyote), his Speed increases to 35 feet, and he gains a bite (+23 to hit for 2d6+4 piercing damage). In raven form, he is Tiny, gains a fly Speed of 25 feet, and gains a beak (agile, +23 to-hit for 2d4+4 piercing damage)."

On a success, the Trickster gains possession of any one item he chooses of up to 2 Bulk that the target is currently holding, wearing, wielding, or has stowed on their person. This must be a single item and does not include full sets of clothing like worn armor or garments."

    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,teleportation) **Frequency** once per day\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The Immortal Trickster trades places with one of his sensory animals (see trickster's network, above). The animal appears in the square the Trickster is currently occupying and the Trickster teleports to the animal's original location with all of his possessions. If a creature has witnessed the Trickster's Change Shape, they must succeed at a `DC 38 Perception check` check to [[Actions/Sense Motive|Sense Motive]] or be fooled into thinking that the Trickster has simply changed shape into an animal instead of teleported."

### The Immortal Trickster

The Immortal Trickster is an immortal spirit guide who always returns to life no matter how he's killed. After his death, he often recorporates in the same area, though if his body is destroyed in its entirety, he sometimes awakens in an entirely different continent.
