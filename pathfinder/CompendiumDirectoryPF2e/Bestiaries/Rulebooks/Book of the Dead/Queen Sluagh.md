The queen steals a spell slot or training. If she steals a spell from a prepared caster, she transfers the spell to herself; if she steals from a spontaneous caster, she gains a prepared spell of the appropriate rank and expends one of the creature's spell slots of that rank. If she steals training, she chooses Perception, attack modifier, or any skill. For 24 hours, she gains a +2 status bonus to that statistic and the creature takes a -2 status penalty.

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead spend an action to use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

A queen sluagh grows more powerful by devouring souls collected from underlings or drained directly through her proboscis. The muscular tongue inside is tipped with a cartilaginous, barbed quill that feeds the queen not only the soul, but the strengths of its owner. A queen conceals her nest deep in a secluded area, such as a forest or graveyard.

* * *

A soul about to leave its physical body gives off a peculiar scent, usually unnoticed by mortal creatures. But the undead fey called sluagh can smell and track down its location with frightening ease. Unlike most fey, sluagh are undead, possessing strong connections to void energy and mortal souls. Sluagh collect the souls of those close to death and bring them to feed their queen.

Most sluagh appear bald-headed, with rounded ears, sharp teeth, glossy black eyes, and scrawny bodies. Their rib cages show through their skin, which is translucent and soft as velvet.

Sluagh can become ghostly and incorporeal for brief periods. They use this power to stalk their prey to great effect. Sometimes the glimpse of a sluagh is mistaken for a ghost sighting.
