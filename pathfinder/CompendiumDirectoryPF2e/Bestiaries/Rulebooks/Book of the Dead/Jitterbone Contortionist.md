The jitterbone loses Compression while their Osseous Defense is active. The jitterbone can end Osseous Defense as a single action, retracting their bones back into their body.\n\n**Melee** `pf2:1` bone spike +14 (finesse), **Damage** 2d8+2 piercing plus 1d6 persistent bleed\n\n**Ranged** `pf2:1` bone dart +14 (agile, thrown 20 feet), **Damage** 2d6+2 piercing"

Aptly named jitterbones, halfling mortics are capable of controlling the density and rigidity of their skeletal structure. When relaxed, they have elongated, rubbery limbs. When they harden their bones, they become difficult to harm and bony spikes jut from their flesh.

Mortics are humanoids overwhelmed by void energy who tenaciously cling to life, straddling the line between living and dead.
