The floor in a 30-foot cone in front of the ossature becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute. Any square of a wall built by iruxis that's in the cone lashes out, with fossilized claws damaging any enemy within 5 feet of the wall. This deals 6d6 piercing damage with a `DC 22 Reflex check`. A creature attempts the save only once, even if adjacent to more than one affected square of the wall. Fossil Fury has no effect on the ossature's allies and never damages iruxi eggs."

    desc: "`pf2:2` (mental,primal) The iruxi ossature visits visions made of starlight, resembling totemic paintings or constellation diagrams, upon creatures in a 30-foot emanation. Any lizardfolk allies in the area are inspired, gaining a +1 status bonus to attack rolls, and each enemy in the area must succeed at a `DC 21 Will check` save or be [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]]. Both effects last for 1 minute or until the ossature is destroyed, whichever comes first.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Totems of the Past|Effect: Totems of the Past]]"

Iruxis, also known as lizardfolk, are surrounded by the spirits of their ancestors—literally, as they honor their dead by incorporating their bones into the architecture of iruxi settlements. Decades of veneration by their descendants have caused primal power to accumulate within these remains. In times of crisis, these earth-encrusted bones reanimate as guardians of last resort. Iruxis often refer to these undead—spirits bathed in starlight animating bone and rock, fueled by the beliefs of the living—as "the twilight guardians."

Iruxi ossatures usually reanimate spontaneously when a nesting chamber is violated or blood is spilled in an iruxi settlement's main hall. Truly ancient settlements might be blessed with a few ossatures' presence at all times: guarding nurseries, reliquaries, and the sacred observatories where their descendants study the heavens. These particularly hardy ossatures are composed of fossilized bone and possess dinosaur-like shield frills, horns, or spiked tails.
