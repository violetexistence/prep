Feared by mariners and coastal dwellers everywhere, the aquatic ghouls known as lacedons are said to be the spawn of an ancient crew of sailors who became lost at sea and were forced to resort to cannibalism to survive. Their appearance is the stuff of a diver's nightmare, supplementing the vicious traits of their land-bound kin with spines, fins, and wide mouths bristling with needle-sharp teeth like piscine predators of the nethermost ocean depths.

* * *

Devious and cunning, ghouls can be found anywhere corpses are laid to rest, forever seeking to satisfy their boundless craving for humanoid flesh.
