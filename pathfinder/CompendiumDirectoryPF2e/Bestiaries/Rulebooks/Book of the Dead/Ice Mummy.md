The cold of high places coupled with strong winds and less oxygen creates an effect that can preserve bodies, mummifying them through natural processes. Many are created deliberately by cults, and a rare few voluntarily transform.

The versatility of mummification allows the creation of mummies through a wide range of methodsâ€”nature, ritual, alchemy, and combinations of all these.
