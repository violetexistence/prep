Rarely, the bones of a spellcaster can be used to create a skeleton that retains a limited ability to cast spells. These spells are almost always offensive in nature, and the skeletal mage uses them with reckless abandon. Skeletal mages are often misidentified as liches, and while not nearly as cunning or deadly, they still pose a significant threat to their foes.

Among the ranks of the dead, none are so numerous, nor so varied, as the skeleton. While most are almost entirely made from bone, some maintain a few scraps of flesh to aid them in movement, such as wing membranes.
