  - name: "Warrior's Mask"
    desc: "  A grappling spirit wears a mask that allows them to abandon their original form and become a warrior focused solely on combat. This mask is quasi-corporeal, allowing it to be manipulated by both corporeal and incorporeal creatures. A creature who has the grappling spirit [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]] can remove the mask as an Interact action by succeeding at an `DC 29 Athletics check` check against the grappling spirit's Fortitude DC. Removing a grappling spirit's mask causes the spirit to fly into a frenzy. The grappling spirit becomes [[Conditions/Quickened|Quickened]] and can use their extra action to Fly, [[Actions/Grapple|Grapple]], or Strike. They also gain a +4 status bonus to damage rolls, and they take a -4 status penalty to AC and Reflex saving throws. If the mask is put back on, the grappling spirit ends their frenzy."

  - name: "Ghostly Grasp"
    desc: "  A grappling spirit can [[Actions/Grapple|Grapple]] corporeal creatures despite being incorporeal. The grappling spirit uses their Athletics check to Grapple as normal but can't use Athletics for other actions that require corporeal contact, like [[Actions/Force Open|Force Open]] or [[Actions/Trip|Trip]]."

  - name: "Submission Lock"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (nonlethal) **Requirements** The grappling spirit has a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The spirit saps their opponent's strength with a supernatural grip. The grappling spirit attempts an Athletics check to [[Actions/Grapple|Grapple]] a creature they have grabbed or restrained, also adding 4d10+12 void damage, depending on the result.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature takes double damage. If it's already enfeebled, it falls [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]]. If not, it is [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 2]] until the end of its next turn and [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]] for 1 minute.\n\n**Success** The creature takes full damage and is enfeebled 1 until the end of its next turn."

  - name: "Teleporting Clothesline"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (occult,teleportation) **Requirements** The grappling spirit has a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The grappling spirit pushes the creature 15 feet in a straight line. The spirit immediately teleports 20 feet to intercept. They make a ghostly hand Strike against the creature. On a hit, the creature is knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]], and on a critical hit, it also takes an additional 2d6 bludgeoning damage as it's driven to the ground."

  - name: "Victory Celebration"
    desc: "  If a spirit knocks a creature [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]], each creature within 60 feet that witnesses the victory is targeted with a `DC 26 Will check` [[Spells/Roaring Applause|Roaring Applause]] spell. The spirit must spend all their actions until the end of the turn celebrating, and a new medal or belt appears on the spirit."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Improved Grab|Improved Grab]]"
    desc: "  **Requirements** The monster's last action was a successful Strike that lists Improved Grab in its damage entry, or the monster has a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]\n* * *\n\n**Effect** If used after a Strike, the monster attempts to [[Actions/grapple|grapple]] the creature using the body part it attacked with as a free action. This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead spend an action to use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

When a great gladiator or wrestler meets their demise, their soul can sometimes linger out of a love for combat and sport. Every grappling spirit manifests a mask that represents the legacy of the warrior they were during their life.
