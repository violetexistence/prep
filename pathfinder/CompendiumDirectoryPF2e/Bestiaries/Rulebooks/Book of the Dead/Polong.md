    desc: "`pf2:3` (incapacitation,mental,occult,possession) The polong attempts to possess an adjacent corporeal creature. This has the same effect as the [[Spells/Possession|Possession]] spell (`DC 26 Will check`), except the duration is 24 hours and, since the polong doesn't have a physical body, they're unaffected by that restriction of the spell. If the target has critically failed its save and become fully possessed by this polong before, it gets a save result one degree of success worse than it rolled.\n\nA creature possessed by a polong becomes [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]] and [[Conditions/Doomed|Doomed 1]]. These conditions don't reduce naturally unless the polong spends an entire day without possessing the creature. For each consecutive day the polong is able to return and possess the creature, the drained and doomed values each increase by 1, to a maximum of 4. If the polong possesses a different creature, the conditions end for any creature it previously possessed."

Polongs exist to serve their creators as loyal familiars, spies, and assassins. Their convenience makes them popular among the wicked, as each resides within a glass bottle which normally seems to contain only a small amount of red liquid. When addressed by their owner, a polong appears within their bottle as a tiny, beautiful humanoid drenched in blood. Forcing one to manifest outside the bottle reveals their true shape: a blood-soaked spirit with a hateful visage and sickle-shaped claws.

The ritual to create a polong originated in Minata and is known primarily by Tian-Sing spellcasters, but only those willing to practice such evil. The ritualist must collect the blood of a murdered humanoid in a small bottle and perform daily incantations, which can take up to 14 days. Once the polong forms, they drink the blood of their creator every day, most often taken from a finger inserted into their bottle. At the master's order, a polong will travel up to 10 miles away to locate a particular person, possess them, and either slowly whittle them down via possession until they die, or force them to attack anyone nearby until someone slays the victim in self-defense.
