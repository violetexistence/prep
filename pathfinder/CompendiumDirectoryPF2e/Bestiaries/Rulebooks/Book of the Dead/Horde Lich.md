  - name: "Servitor Assembly"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (manipulate) A horde lich has three servitor bodies folded up and attached to themself, usually in the ribcage, on the arms, and around the legs. The lich detaches one of these servitors and places it in any open, adjacent space. The lich can alternatively take this action to reattach an adjacent servitor.\n\nThe lich and their servitors share actions and Hit Points, and the servitors use the same statistics as the lich. Spells and effects that target the lich or their servitors affect all of them equally, but they're still treated as just one creature when targeted by spells and attacks. The horde lich attempts only one save against such effects, but they take a -2 circumstance penalty to defend against effects that target both the lich and one or more detached servitors. Whenever the horde lich Casts a Spell, they can choose to have the spell originate from themself or from any one of their detached servitors. If the horde lich is destroyed, all attached servitors are destroyed as well. If a servitor is dealt a critical hit, it's destroyed (and the horde lich takes the damage as normal)."

At first glance, a horde lich looks like a skeleton packed with too many bones. In combat, the true purpose of these extra parts becomes clear as limbs peel off, expanding and reassembling into another nimble skeletal form. Regardless of the number, the single lich mind controls them all, and if any of them survive an encounter, they can rebuild the whole given enough time and raw materials.

* * *

A desire to live eternally motivates a spellcaster to become a lich, and necromantic knowledge makes the desire real. The typical lich takes the most direct path, keeping their undead form fairly close to their appearance in life. But undeath can also bring greater freedom for those with a less conventional view of what they can become. The horde lich and runecarved lich reshape themselves entirely.
