Scorned hounds rise from the most devoted dogs. They're incredibly possessive of their owners, allowing no living beings to approach and refusing to be parted.

* * *

Bonds of loyalty that endure beyond death reanimate pets to crawl from their graves within days of dying, returning to the side of their past owners, family, or pack. Unfortunately, death irrevocably changes a risen pet. They return as aggressive, predatory beasts, difficult to control and easy to anger. Even the most friendly and docile of pets becomes sadistic and violent in undeathâ€”fixating first on those it views as competition for the attention of its owners. When a risen pet is jilted, rebuffed, or offended by its owner, it turns on them.
