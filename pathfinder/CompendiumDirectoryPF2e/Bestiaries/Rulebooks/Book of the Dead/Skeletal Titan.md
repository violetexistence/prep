Only the powerful and foolish would raise the bones of a mighty titan or similarly gargantuan creature as a skeleton. Skilled practitioners see this as a waste of a powerful body and imbue them with air walking magic based on those of titans, while the wise know it's nearly impossible to control such a colossus and that it's just as likely to crush its creator underneath its mighty foot as it is to smite their foes.

Among the ranks of the dead, none are so numerous, nor so varied, as the skeleton. While most are almost entirely made from bone, some maintain a few scraps of flesh to aid them in movement, such as wing membranes.
