On a critical failure, the duration is 1 month and the creature gains Onryo's Rancor, which it's also compelled to use by the geas.

The creature must attempt a `DC 32 Fortitude check` save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature becomes [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]].\n\n**Failure** The creature becomes [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]].\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature becomes [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 3]] and the mass fully blocks the creature's airway.

Onryos are created when a person dies violently in the grip of extreme emotion, such as unbridled rage or overwhelming sorrow. These twisted undead return as beings of pure vengeance, seeking to endlessly spread suffering. Onryos torment those who killed them, but not by directly attacking their murderer. Instead, an onryo hunts down the friends, family members, and anyone connected to their foe. In doing so, the onryo inflicts as much torment as possible on the person responsible for their demise. An onryo's vengeful nature persists indefinitely; not even the death of their killer sates their lust for destruction. Vengeance is just a way for them to spread their pain to others, and they quickly find new targets for their ire. Onryos always wear funeral clothing, often dripping wet or covered in filth. Most of them also display wounds or signs indicating how they died. As they move, onryos seem to pop in and out of existence, making them difficult to track in combat.
