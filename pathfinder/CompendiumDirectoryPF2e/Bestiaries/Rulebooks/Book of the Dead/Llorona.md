If there's no nearby body of water, the creature instead remains still. The creature can attempt another `DC 31 Will check` save at the end of each of its turns. On a success, the creature is no longer fascinated. Once the fascinated condition ends, the creature becomes stunned 1.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, except the creature receives another Will save only at the end of a round in which it's submerged in water."

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

Vengeful spirits called lloronas arise from people who died overcome with the grief and shame that comes with the tragic drowning of a child. In life, a llorona may have contributed to the child's death or simply lost the child to a horrible accident. In death, a llorona's pain manifests as a malevolent desire to drown others, imparting the same grief that they share with the person's loved ones. To this end, lloronas remain along riversides and other bodies of water in hopes of drawing their next victim and compelling them to drown themselves.

Lloronas look much like they did in life, except they wear elegant funeral attire in undeath. Though stories typically describe lloronas as women, reports from seasoned adventurers include accounts of lloronas appearing as different genders and with a variety of appearances.
