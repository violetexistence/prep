Moving with sinuous grace, these flying drake skeletons are held aloft by rotting membranes stretched between their bony wings. Although just as mindless as other skeletons, skeletal drakes maintain much of the draconic ferocity and raw spite they possessed in life, allowing them to attack viciously.

Among the ranks of the dead, none are so numerous, nor so varied, as the skeleton. While most are almost entirely made from bone, some maintain a few scraps of flesh to aid them in movement, such as wing membranes.
