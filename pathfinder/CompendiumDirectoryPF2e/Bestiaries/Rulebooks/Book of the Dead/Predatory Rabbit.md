Skittish in life, predatory rabbits are fast and nimble predators in unassuming forms. They most enjoy hunting birds, squirrels, cats, and other rabbits.

Bonds of loyalty that endure beyond death reanimate pets to crawl from their graves within days of dying, returning to the side of their past owners, family, or pack. Unfortunately, death irrevocably changes a risen pet. They return as aggressive, predatory beasts, difficult to control and easy to anger. Even the most friendly and docile of pets becomes sadistic and violent in undeathâ€”fixating first on those it views as competition for the attention of its owners. When a risen pet is jilted, rebuffed, or offended by its owner, it turns on them.
