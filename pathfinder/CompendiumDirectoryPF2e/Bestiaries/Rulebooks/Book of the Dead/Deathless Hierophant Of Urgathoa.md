Compared to deathless acolytes, deathless hierophants are often much more ambitious and far-reaching, with goals like seeking an entire nation's conversion to the worship of their deity.

* * *

Deathless acolytes are an oddity among undead, neither willingly transformed nor, strictly speaking, transformed against their will. The creation of a deathless acolyte is an act of direct intervention by a deity, typically as a double-edged reward and curse granted to a faithful priest who failed in completing a divine mandate due to circumstances beyond their control.
