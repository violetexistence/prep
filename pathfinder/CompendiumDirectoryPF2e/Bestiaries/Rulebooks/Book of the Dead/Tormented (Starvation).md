    desc: "  This monster regains the listed number of Hit Points each round at the beginning of its turn. Its [[Conditions/Dying|Dying]] condition never increases beyond Dying 3 as long as its regeneration is active. However, if it takes damage of a type listed in the regeneration entry, its regeneration deactivates until the end of its next turn. Deactivate the regeneration before applying any damage of a listed type, since that damage might kill the monster by bringing it to Dying 4."

Twisted caricatures of living beings, tormented arise from the remains of those who've been tortured to death. They appear as the mortals they were in life, horribly disfigured by acts of cruelty. Unable to rest, they haunt the sites of their deaths, doomed to relive their last moments of agony. The toxic psychic residue of their death is so great it spills over, afflicting anyone who meets the tormented's haunted gaze.
