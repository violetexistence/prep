A creature who hears them understands them to be mutterings of its most closely guarded secrets and private failings laid bare. A creature that first enters the area must attempt a `DC 34 Will check` save. Regardless of the result of the saving throw, the creature is temporarily immune to aura of whispers for 1 minute. The frightened condition from this aura can't be reduced while in the aura.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]].\n\n**Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] and [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]].\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 3]] and [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 3]]."

On a success, the gallowdead can also pull the target adjacent toward them to the distance the gallowdead chooses. Most often, a gallowdead chooses to pull a creature close enough that it's in their reach and out of defensive position, but so the creature still can't reach the gallowdead's body. At the start of the gallowdead's next turn, if the target hasn't Escaped, the target takes the damage of a spiked chain Strike, and the chain releases the creature."

The first gallowdead were hung from enormous, hooked chains from atop the Whispering Tyrant's prison, Gallowspire, and magically bonded to their chains after death. After Gallowspire's destruction, the gallowdead who remained were left to wander the ruins.
