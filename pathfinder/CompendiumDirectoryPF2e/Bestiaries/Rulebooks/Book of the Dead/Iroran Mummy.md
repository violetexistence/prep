When a creature enters or starts its turn in the aura, it's affected by [[Spells/Calm|Calm]] for 1 minute, with a `DC 27 Will check` save.

Some enlightened members of the Iroran faith, particularly monks, are so aware of their own bodily processes they can sense their approaching death from old age. Pinpointing the occurrence to the exact hour, a chosen few employ a method of self-mummification. These masters of life and death leave behind their bodies to watch over Irori's temples.

* * *

The versatility of mummification allows the creation of mummies through a wide range of methodsâ€”nature, ritual, alchemy, and combinations of all these.
