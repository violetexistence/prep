Created from the exoskeleton of a giant stag beetle, this mindless husk can cut a foe in half using its powerful mandibles. The abdomen of this crawling undead is empty, and more than one necromancer has used this space to hide valuable cargo.

Among the ranks of the dead, none are so numerous, nor so varied, as the skeleton. While most are almost entirely made from bone, some maintain a few scraps of flesh to aid them in movement, such as wing membranes.
