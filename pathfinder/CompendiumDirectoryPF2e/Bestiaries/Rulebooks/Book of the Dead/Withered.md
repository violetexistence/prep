If a husk zombie survives for several years, their body continues to dry out, their flesh hardens, and their eyes turn into pale, glowing orbs set deep into otherwise empty sockets. Known as the withered, these zombies are cunning, capable of forming complex plans and even setting traps utilizing their less-intelligent brethren to lure the unsuspecting into deadly ambushes.

Simple to create and varied in purpose, these shambling undead are often used for their strength and endless stamina to conduct boring, repetitive tasks.
