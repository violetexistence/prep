    desc: "(3 actions) The spirit cyclone uses 3 actions to move, traveling up to 30 feet with each action and dealing 2d10+13 void damage to each creature in its path (`DC 32 Reflex check` save). A creature needs to attempt only one save during the cyclone's movement, even if the cyclone moves over its space more than once. On a critical failure, a creature is swept up into the cyclone, becoming [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] ([[Actions/Escape|Escape]] DC 32). A creature grabbed by the cyclone moves along with the cyclone and takes 1d10+6 void damage at their beginning of its turn, and it must attempt a Reflex save against the cyclone on the cyclone's turn, no matter where the cyclone moves. A creature that successfully Escapes from the cyclone falls from a height of 1d12 x 5 feet."
