    desc: "`pf2:r`  **Trigger** A creature within the monster's reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The monster attempts a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, the monster disrupts that action. This Strike doesn't count toward the monster's multiple attack penalty, and its multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike."

  - name: "Hungry Armor"
    desc: "  A creature that Strikes a graveknight warmaster with a melee weapon must succeed at a `DC 31 Reflex check` save or be disarmed of that weapon. If the creature critically fails, the weapon ends up in the graveknight's space. A creature that hits a graveknight warmaster with an unarmed attack must succeed at a `DC 31 Reflex check` or become [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] by the graveknight until the end of its next turn, it Escapes, or the graveknight moves, whichever comes first."

    desc: " (divine) When a graveknight is destroyed, its armor rebuilds its body over the course of 1d10 days-or more quickly if the armor is worn by a living host. If the body is destroyed before then, the process restarts.\n\nA graveknight can only be permanently destroyed by obliterating its armor (such as with [[Spells/Disintegrate|Disintegrate]]), transporting it to the Forge of Creation, or throwing it into the heart of a volcano."

  - name: "Exemplar of Violence"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (visual) **Frequency** once per round\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The graveknight attempts a Strike as their armor flashes with sinister power that spurs allies to violence. After the Strike, allies who can see the graveknight can use a reaction to Step or Stride, but they must end this movement in a space adjacent to an enemy. One ally of the graveknight's choice can instead use a reaction to Strike."
