  - name: "Lair Sense"
    desc: " (detection,divine) The relictner bonds with a single structure they consider their lair, such as a house, temple, or ruin.

    desc: "`pf2:1` (divine) The relictner draws in a deep breath and holds it, temporarily suspending their biological processes and becoming undead. The relictner gains the undead trait and becomes immune to bleed, death effects, disease, [[Conditions/Paralyzed|Paralyzed]], poison, and sleep. Any such effects the relictner is currently inflicted with are suspended but take effect again once they take a breath.\n\nDeath Gasp lasts as long as the relictner holds their breath (up to 12 rounds).\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Death Gasp|Effect: Death Gasp]]"

  - name: "Demolition"
    desc: "`pf2:3` (divine) The relictner bellows in fury, causing the surrounding structure to collapse. All creatures in a 30-foot emanation take 8d10 bludgeoning damage from falling debris (`DC 31 Reflex check`). A creature that fails its save is knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]. The area becomes difficult terrain.\n\nThe relictner can't use Demolition again for 1d4 rounds."

Regardless of age, relictners look like ancient dwarves with deep wrinkles, sparse white hair, and decrepit forms. As their bodies degrade, so too do their surroundings, with even the finest architecture crumbling to ruins.

Mortics are humanoids overwhelmed by void energy who tenaciously cling to life, straddling the line between living and dead.
