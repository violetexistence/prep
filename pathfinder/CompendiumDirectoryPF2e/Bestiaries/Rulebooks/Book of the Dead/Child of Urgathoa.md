Only the most fanatic followers of Urgathoa, goddess of disease, gluttony, and undeath, could ever hope to become a child of Urgathoa. These "blessed" undead can't be created by any save Urgathoa herself, and the blessing must be bestowed at the moment of death. Those rare few chosen by their goddess to serve as undying vessels for her power are revered by Urgathoa's faithful. Most surround themselves with fanatic cults or undead armies, subjugating and terrorizing secluded communities.

Children of Urgathoa are arrogant, notoriously cruel, and utterly devoted to their goddess and her teachings. They show no favor to members of their faith, inflicting pain and sowing infection throughout Urgathoa's clergy as often as unaffiliated victims. Children of Urgathoa are at their most sadistic while punishing heretics, particularly those who prove too afraid to accept the goddess's gifts of death and undeath.
