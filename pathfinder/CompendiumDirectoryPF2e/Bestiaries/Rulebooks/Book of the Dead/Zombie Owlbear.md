Zombie owlbears combine an owlbear's ferocity with mindless undead hatred. Once it draws near, it often stands up, unleashing a guttural, wet roar, before charging into combat without thought of self-preservation.

Simple to create and varied in purpose, these shambling undead are often used for their strength and endless stamina to conduct boring, repetitive tasks.
