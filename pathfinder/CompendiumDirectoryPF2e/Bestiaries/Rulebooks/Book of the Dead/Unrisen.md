    desc: "  A creature with a prepared or spontaneous spell that can restore the dead to life (such as [[Spells/Breath of Life|Breath of Life]] or [[Spells/Raise Dead|Raise Dead]]) can expend an appropriate spell slot as a 2-action activity to destroy an unrisen within 30 feet.

  - name: "Awful Approach"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  The unrisen reshapes its grotesque form to move swiftly. It Strides twice. Any living creature that can see the unrisen during this movement must succeed at a `DC 28 Fortitude check` save or be [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] ([[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]] on a critical failure). This is a mental and visual effect. The unrisen can't use Awful Approach again for 1d4 rounds."

    desc: "`pf2:1` (curse,occult) **Requirements** The unrisen has a living creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The unrisen attempts to destroy its victim's life force to share the unrisen's fate. The creature must succeed at a `DC 30 Fortitude check` save or become [[Conditions/Doomed|Doomed 1]]. While the curse lasts, the creature regains only half as many HP from vitality healing effects; if it dies, any attempt to raise it from the dead causes it to return as an unrisen. The curse ends automatically if the creature's doomed value is reduced to 0."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Grab|Grab]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** The monster's last action was a successful Strike that lists Grab in its damage entry, or the monster has a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]\n* * *\n\n**Effect** If used after a Strike, the monster attempts to [[Actions/grapple|grapple]] the creature using the body part it attacked with. This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

An unrisen is a mangled conglomeration of splintered bones, decaying organs, and rotting flesh, created when a ritual such as resurrect goes catastrophically wrong. Immense care must be taken, for if the ritual is a critical failure, an unrisen can be the resultâ€”as many a ritualist has learned to their horror.

Unrisen are barely intelligent, aware only of the agony constantly inflicted by their flawed creation and their resentment for the living. They tend to attack the casters involved in the botched ritual first before lashing out at everyone else around them. Though an unrisen's twisted form is unrecognizable as the intended target of the resurrection, its wordless howls are often disturbingly similar to the deceased's voice. If an unrisen is destroyed before it can rise again, it's reduced to a handful of metallic blue-green salts referred to as essential salts.
