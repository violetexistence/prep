The chosen creature finds a pair of dice in its hand and is compelled by fate to roll them; it can and must roll the dice even if its hands are full or it is unable to act. The creature rolls 2d6, adding them together to determine the effect.\n\n*   **7 or 11** (healing, vitality) The target regains 15 vitality healing HP.\n*   **2, 3, or 12** (void) The target takes 30 void damage. If the target is [[Conditions/Dying|Dying]], this damage increases its dying condition by 2 instead of 1.\n*   **Any Other Roll** (void) The target takes 15 void damage."

For many, gambling is just fun and games, but for some, it can become a bad habit or even a life-consuming addiction. Bone croupiers take the meaning of "life-consuming" to its literal extreme. These gamblers' lust for cards and dice couldn't be sated in life, so in undeath they haunt the shadowy corners of gambling halls and continue their search for that next hit of adrenaline.

For bone croupiers, gaming takes on a different flavor; with nothing left to lose, these undead turn their attentions toward others, cajoling and palavering normally casual gamers into committing themselves to ever-higher stakes. Before they know it, these unsuspecting victims have called in decadesold favors and put liens on their homes in the hope of winning back just a fraction of the pot. By then, the bone croupier has already claimed their prize-to this undead chiseler, any earnings are incidental, and the real prize is encouraging others to lose their own.

Bone croupiers often enshroud themselves in thick layers of cigar smoke or voluminous robes to mask their undead nature, but they almost always wear wicked grins at the table. This smile is no ruse or part of their poker face, however-the truth is that bone croupiers truly delight in games, regardless of whether they win or lose, and despite their incredible skills of deception and trickery, most simply can't disguise their unbridled mirth.
