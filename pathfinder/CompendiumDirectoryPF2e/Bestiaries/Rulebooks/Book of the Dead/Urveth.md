If a swallowed creature is of the maximum size listed, the monster can't use Swallow Whole again. If the creature is smaller than the maximum, the monster can usually swallow more creatures; the GM determines the maximum. The monster attempts an `Athletics check` check opposed by the grabbed creature's Reflex DC. If it succeeds, it swallows the creature. The monster's mouth or jaws no longer grab a creature it has swallowed, so the monster is free to use them to Strike or Grab once again. The monster can't attack creatures it has swallowed.\n\nA swallowed creature is [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]], is [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]], and has to hold its breath or start suffocating. The swallowed creature takes the listed amount of damage when first swallowed and at the end of each of its turns while it's swallowed. If the victim [[Actions/Escape|Escapes]] this ability's grabbed condition, it exits through the monster's mouth. This frees any other creature grabbed in the monster's mouth or jaws. A swallowed creature can attack the monster that has swallowed it, but only with unarmed attacks or with weapons of light Bulk or less. The swallowing creature is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] against the attack. If the monster takes piercing or slashing damage equaling or exceeding the listed Rupture value from a single attack or spell, the swallowed creature cuts itself free. A creature that gets free by either Escaping or cutting itself free can immediately breathe and exits the swallowing monster's space.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Engulf and Swallow Whole|Effect: Engulf and Swallow Whole]]\n\nIf the monster dies, a swallowed creature can be freed by creatures adjacent to the corpse if they spend a combined total of 3 actions cutting the monster open with a weapon or unarmed attack that deals piercing or slashing damage."

An urveth is a massive, four-armed burrowing terror with a wormlike body and gaping maw that devours everything it can. Urveths burrow deep underground to hide from the sun, emerging under the cover of darkness to kill and consume.

* * *

Darvakkas, also called nightshades, are a ravenous evil made up of equal parts darkness and malice. Originally creatures of the Outer Planes who travel to the convergence of the Shadow Plane and the Void—where the power of nothingness obliterates them—these undead abominations are the physical embodiment of entropy. They burn with an intense hatred for all life, working to bring a final, dark night to the Material Plane where nothing but ash and ice remain.

As creatures twisted by darkness and shadow, darvakkas have a great aversion to sunlight and all sources of vitality energy. On the Material Plane, they spend the hours of daylight hidden below ground, amid ruins, or submerged deep in the ocean's darkest chasms beyond the reach of the sun's rays, emerging when darkness shelters them overhead.

Darvakkas have an aura of entropy that attracts undead thralls to serve as warriors and heralds. They rarely seek alliances with each other or other creatures, existing in solitude as the heads of individual armies of the dead.
