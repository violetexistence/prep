Some of the wealthy have their favored pets mummified or wish to use the animal's fractured memories but strong instincts and natural weapons to turn them into formidable tomb guardians. No other animal was so trusted in the afterlife as felines, who were almost without exception buried alongside deceased pharaohs.

The versatility of mummification allows the creation of mummies through a wide range of methodsâ€”nature, ritual, alchemy, and combinations of all these.
