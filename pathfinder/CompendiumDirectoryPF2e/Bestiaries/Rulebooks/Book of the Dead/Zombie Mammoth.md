    desc: "  When the zombie mammoth is hit by a critical hit that deals slashing damage, the mammoth's trunk is severed from its body. Any creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]] with the trunk is released, and the mammoth loses its trunk Strike and Greater Constrict.\n\nThe trunk slithers across the battlefield, still animated, and acts in initiative right after the mammoth. It retains Greater Constrict and trunk Strikes but can't use tusk Strikes, foot Strikes, or Shambling Trample. It has all the stats of the mammoth, except its AC is reduced to 23, it has only 50 Hit Points, and its Speed is 10 feet. Damage dealt to the severed trunk has no effect on the zombie mammoth."

Simple to create and varied in purpose, these shambling undead are often used for their strength and endless stamina to conduct boring, repetitive tasks.
