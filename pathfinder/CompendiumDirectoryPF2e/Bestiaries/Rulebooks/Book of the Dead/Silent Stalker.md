When a person is betrayed and killed in a way that their voice was silenced (such as through strangulation by a lover or close confidante), they might come back as a silent stalker. A silent stalker is a horrifying, twisted likeness of the person they were in life, with one obvious difference: the silent stalker has no mouth, simply a smooth patch of flesh where a mouth should be. Sound is suppressed in an area around a silent stalker, but once someone notices the quiet, it's often too late.

* * *

A revenant is a vengeful undead who stalks the one who killed them in life. They're relentless in the pursuit of their murderer, seeking a final justice.
