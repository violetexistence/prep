A pale stranger arises when a gunslinger is slain in a duel by an underhanded foe. Buried with their pistols, the corpse claws out of the grave to wreak vengeance upon their killer for cheating. Sometimes a pale stranger is created when a particularly petty gunslinger is beaten fairly and refuses to accept defeat, though such an individual must be especially self-delusional to retain the hatred necessary to spur the transformation. Whatever the circumstance, a pale stranger can wield their firearms with deadly grace and efficacy.

* * *

A revenant is a vengeful undead who stalks the one who killed them in life. They're relentless in the pursuit of their murderer, seeking a final justice.
