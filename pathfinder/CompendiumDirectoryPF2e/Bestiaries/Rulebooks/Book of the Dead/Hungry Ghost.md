A creature can be affected by only one delayed Feed on the Living at a time, and if the ghost loses their living visage during that minute, the Feed on the Living is lost.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target's life energy overpowers the ghost.

Hungry ghosts arise from those who didn't receive proper burials or whose graves were neglected. They are not bound to a site or item but are compelled to see opportunities to commit good deeds in hopes of gaining favors that can aid them in achieving a final rest. Their need to feed on living energy often conflicts with this goal, however.

Tethered to the world after death by powerful emotions that haven't been resolved, ghosts haunt the living as sad echoes of their former selves.
