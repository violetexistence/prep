Goblin mortics have blackened, charred flesh and smoldering burns all over their body, as if they'd been burned alive. They are highly flammable but inured to the pain, and they enjoy lighting themselves (and everything else) on fire.

Mortics are humanoids overwhelmed by void energy who tenaciously cling to life, straddling the line between living and dead.
