  - name: "Special"
    desc: "passive Spectral reflections often infuse entire buildings, manifesting in any sufficiently large mirror. The example Hit Points and Hardness given represent a typical mirror reinforced by the haunt; at your discretion, the haunt might appear in reflective surfaces that are harder to destroy. Defeating a manifestation through damage destroys the surface, preventing the haunt from using it again. If this haunt appears in an area with many mirrors, consider giving PCs double or even triple the XP for a typical simple hazard."

    desc: "The haunt re-forms after 1 minute, manifesting in any mirror within its infused area (see Special below)."
