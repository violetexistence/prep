    desc: "A trapdoor covers a 10-foot-square pit that's 30 feet deep and has 5 feet of water at the bottom. Four water spouts in the walls connect to hidden water tanks. Each water spout extends out of a different wall, 6 inches from the top of the pit."

    desc: "`pf2:r` **Trigger** A creature walks onto the trapdoor\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The triggering creature falls in and takes damage from the fall, reduced by 5 feet for falling into the water (typically 12 bludgeoning damage). A creature can [[Actions/Grab an Edge|Grab an Edge]] to avoid falling. The trapdoor then slams shut, and the hazard rolls initiative."

  - name: "Routine"
    desc: "(4 actions) The trap loses 1 action each turn for each disabled water spout. On each of the trap's actions, a spout pours water, increasing the depth of the water by 5 feet. Once the pit is full of water, the pit stops using actions, but creatures in the pit begin drowning."
  - name: "Reset"
    desc: "The trap can be reset if the door is manually reengaged and the water tanks are refilled; it can be reset without draining the pit, but doing so renders the pit less effective."
