The creatures' minds move so quickly that each round seems to last a century, but their bodies and magical energies move so slowly that they can't use any actions except Recall Knowledge. An affected creature must attempt a `DC 36 Will check` saving throw against a _warp mind_ spell immediately and again for every minute of real time that passes while the creature is trapped in the frozen moment. This effect has an unlimited duration but can be counteracted."
