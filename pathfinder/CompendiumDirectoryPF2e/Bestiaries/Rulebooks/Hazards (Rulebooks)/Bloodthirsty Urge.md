The creature must attempt a `DC 29 Will check` save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The target makes a Strike against itself and automatically hits; the target also becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]].\n\n**Failure** The target makes a Strike against itself and automatically scores a critical hit; the target also becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]].\n\n**Critical Failure** The target attempts a Fortitude save. If the target succeeds, it is subject to the effects of a failure instead. If the target fails, it is reduced to 0 HP and dies"
