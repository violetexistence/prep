    desc: "A raging spectral inferno arises out of thin air, strengthening all undead creatures within its area.

    desc: "(1 action) Phantom flames rage across the haunted area, dealing 4d6 fire damage to each living creature within the area (`DC 23 Will check` save). Undead creatures in the area are infused with flames for the following round. They gain the fire trait and immunity to fire, and all their attacks deal an additional 1d6 fire damage. Objects in the area are unaffected."
  - name: "Reset"
    desc: "The flames cease 1 minute after all living creatures leave the area, but after 1 hour, the anger and pain simmer up and the haunt is ready to trigger again."
