    desc: "(1 action) The flood advances forward 60 feet, crashing into all creatures within its area. Each creature must attempt a `DC 30 Fortitude check` save as the floodwaters pummel them and pull them downstream. The amount and type of damage dealt are based on the nature of the flood, and certain types of floods impose additional effects. The turbulent waters mean creatures within the area of the flood must attempt a `DC 20 Athletics check` check to Swim in order to move, and those who do not succeed at a check to Swim each round may drown.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature takes no damage.\n\n**Success** The creature takes half damage.\n\n**Failure** The creature takes full damage and is moved 10 feet along with the water.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and is moved 20 feet along with the water.\n* * *\n\n*   **Acidic Runoff** This caustic flood dissolves flesh as it moves, dealing 1d12 bludgeoning damage and 1d12+8 acid damage. Additionally, it deals 2d6 persistent acid damage to creatures who critically fail their Fortitude saves.\n*   **Battering Waves** This flood of rushing water deals 2d12+10 bludgeoning damage.\n*   **Repulsive Refuse** This flood has picked up tainted or disease-ridden objects like sewer runoff or rotting food. It deals 2d12+8 bludgeoning damage. Each creature exposed to the flood must attempt a `DC 29 Fortitude check` save, becoming [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] on a failure or [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]] on a critical failure. Additionally, creatures who come into contact with the flood waters are exposed to filth fever (`DC 20 Fortitude check`).\n*   **Sharp Debris** The waters have picked up various objects, some of which are particularly sharp. The flood deals 1d12 bludgeoning damage and 1d12+12 piercing damage.\n*   **Sticky Goo** The substance is particularly sticky. It deals 2d12+6 bludgeoning damage. Additionally, each creature in the flood must attempt a `DC 29 Reflex check` save at the beginning of their turn each round. On a failed saving throw, they take a -10-foot circumstance penalty to all their Speeds for 1 round. On a critical failure, they are instead [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] for 1 round."
