    desc: "`pf2:r` (divine) **Trigger** A creature tries to steal the object or intrude upon the location. If someone uses a proxy or dupe for the theft or intrusion, the trap unerringly targets the true perpetrator or perpetrators at any distanceâ€”even across planes.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The triggering creature and up to five coconspirators instantly revert to infants, losing all memories, class abilities, and other skills acquired during their lives (`DC 44 Fortitude check` negates). Reversing this effect is nearly impossible, requiring powerful magic such as [[Spells/Wish|Wish]]."
