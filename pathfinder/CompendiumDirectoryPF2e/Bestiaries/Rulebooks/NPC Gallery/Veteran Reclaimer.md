_This grizzled half-orc wields a longbow with the familiarity of a woman who considers it more as an extension of her body than a weapon._

When Lastwall fell, many of the former Knights of Ozem became disheartened and scattered, wandering aimlessly through the wilds of the Inner Sea. Though the horrific events that led to the fall of Lastwall shook their faith in the traditional hierarchy of the Knights, they hardened their resolve to hunt all undead from the face of Golarion. These Crimson Reclaimers still see the Whispering Tyrant as their primary foe, but they can be found in many of the most haunted regions of the world, living off the land and hunting the restless dead.

While heroism and fervor for their cause still burns in their heart, veteran reclaimers have lived long enough to lose their taste for tales of courtly valor and valiant last stands. They have learned the value of caution and thus engage their enemies from range and use terrain to their advantage. They are quick to strike back at enemies that harm their allies, knowing staunch teammates are essential in the face of the world's many horrors.

* * *

Though the nation of Lastwall is shattered and its leaders have fled, the courage of those who once defended its shining walls remains strong. The Knights of Lastwall are found in places of great calamity, escorting civilians and beating back the undead. Should the PCs ever venture into a crisis zone, they may likely as not see the Knights of Lastwall there as well, be they forming an armored wall to defend the innocent or creeping through deathly wastelands where even the bravest know mortal fear. Unless the PCs are evil or unwitting dupes of Tar-Baphon's agents, the Whispering Way, these knights mostly serve as precious allies in realms where friendly faces are rare. The virtuous defender could be a member of a knightly squad or a recruiter seeking those willing to risk their lives to save Avistan from a terrible peril. The veteran reclaimer is likely found in the depths of the Gravelands or other truly forsaken realms, where even the slightest misstep can lead to death or worse. Such cunning but virtuous souls might request help leading people to safety, act as a guide through unknown territory, or offer valuable advice and information about dangerous creatures or traps the PCs might risk encountering.
