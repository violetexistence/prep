_This handsome gnome sports an impressive coiffure and a flashy costume that catches the eye._

While most Firebrands enjoy the attention their exploits bring, the charming scoundrel takes this to extremes, often boasting about their daring exploits and attempting to parlay stories of their notorious deeds into free drinks or lodging. The scoundrel sees little harm in taking credit for any activities attributed to the organization, provided that intervention from local law enforcement seems unlikely. They are likely to take on high-profile jobs for the Firebrands just for the thrill of later recounting the narrow scrapes of their adventure.

The charming scoundrel is as dramatic in combat as outside of it, often darting from opponent to opponent and disorienting foes with flashy swordplay. If a battle is going well, the scoundrel will often shout taunts at slow-footed opponents or encouragement to allies. While prideful and competitive, the scoundrel is a pragmatist at heart and will opt to add a tale of a cunning escape to their repertoire if the odds seem stacked against them.

* * *

Wherever oppression or an opportunity for daring adventure can be found, the Firebrands can be found chasing after. PCs might find the Firebrands to be allies in a quest for righteous rebellion or justice against slavery, or they might find these dashing daredevils to be friendly-or not so friendly-rivals for the same treasure. The charming scoundrel presented here could easily be a low level freedom fighter or foil for the PCs, or might serve as crew for the privateer captain. The privateer captain can serve as a transport willing to take the PCs to the most dangerous locations, an intermittent ally that provides a timely rescue when least expected, a competing explorer, or a powerful and deadly enemy.
