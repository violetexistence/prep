_A faint crust of salt rimes the coattails of this mariner, and her steely eyes gaze from beneath the brim of her tricorne hat._

Dismissively called a pirate or thief by some, the privateer captain commands a loyal crew that plies the waters of the Inner Sea and beyond. Privateers work for their own profit and reputation, of course, but they also commit themselves to keeping the sea-lanes free from navies that strive to enforce land law on the unbounded waves. Tyrants and slavers are their favorite targets, and many a greedy colonizer or trafficker in flesh has been sent to the bottom of the sea after the captain liberated their cargo. Generally, however, the privateer captain is willing to spare prisoners so that they might be ransomed and spread tales of Firebrands' actions across the region.

The privateer captain is often at the vanguard of boarding parties. Many call on the power of the fickle goddess Besmara to strengthen their crew in battle and sanctify each shipboard raid. As at home in water as on deck, a privateer captain will gladly leap into the sea to pursue a foe or rescue a fallen crewmate. Though the privateer captain might run under a false flag or attempt to deceive a foe before battle, they generally honor agreements to surrender and make a point to keep their word, particularly when dealing with other Firebrands.

* * *

Wherever oppression or an opportunity for daring adventure can be found, the Firebrands can be found chasing after. PCs might find the Firebrands to be allies in a quest for righteous rebellion or justice against slavery, or they might find these dashing daredevils to be friendly-or not so friendly-rivals for the same treasure. The charming scoundrel presented here could easily be a low level freedom fighter or foil for the PCs, or might serve as crew for the privateer captain. The privateer captain can serve as a transport willing to take the PCs to the most dangerous locations, an intermittent ally that provides a timely rescue when least expected, a competing explorer, or a powerful and deadly enemy.
