_This sharp-eyed half-elf wears weather-beaten gear that would easily blend in with any natural terrain, and carries an elaborately carved walking staff._

When a group of adepts leaves the Magaambya, whether to investigate a magical phenomenon, conduct a diplomatic mission, or visit scholars in a distant land, a Rain-Scribe often serves as their guide. An expert in travel through difficult environments, the Rain-Scribe provides for their companions while helping them avoid the many hazards of travel in the Inner Sea. Rain-Scribes are some of the most well-traveled members of the academy, and most have secured alliances or promises of safe passage through the lands where they walk.

Should the Rain-Scribe or their companions be attacked on their journeys, the scribe is a capable combatant who strives to turn their communion with the natural world into their greatest advantage in battle. Whether by using primal magic against their foes or striking unseen from the underbrush, the Rain-Scribe assures that no opponent threatens their traveling companions for long.

Incredible events have rocked the lands of Avistan over the past 10 years, from whole cities reappearing out of a loop in time to magical explosions vaporizing the prison of Gallowspire. These marvels, both terrible and awe inspiring, inevitably attracted the attention of the Magaambya academy, home of scholars of magic in all its forms. Scholars, emissaries, and spies alike have now established Magaambyan centers in the north, seeking to learn and to help those they can along the way.
