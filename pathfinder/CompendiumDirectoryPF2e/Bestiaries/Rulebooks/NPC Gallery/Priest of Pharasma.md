Cloistered priests safeguard their temples and communities. They are the stalwart keepers of their god's tenets, devoted to spreading the word. Their guidance or healing services come at the cost of a donation.

Religions inspire devout individuals to uphold their tenets. Many of these devotees seek to bring respite and hope, but others have darker motives.
