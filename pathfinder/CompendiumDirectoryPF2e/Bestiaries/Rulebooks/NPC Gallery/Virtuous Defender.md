_With his well-worn plate armor and mighty shield, this tall figure appears ready to stand against any foe._

Even with the fall of the nation of Lastwall, many people still dedicate their lives to opposing the forces and schemes of the Whispering Tyrant. Styling themselves the Shining Sentinels, they see themselves as a bulwark against the further spread of the Tyrant's influence. When not rallying troops to battle against their sworn foe or protecting villages from undead incursions, these knights travel the Inner Sea in hopes of recruiting other righteous souls to fight against the undead hordes.

Many Shining Sentinels are servants of good deities, such as Iomedae; in battle, they turn their god-given powers against their foes. These virtuous warriors put the safety of their companions before their own and often hold defensive positions to protect their allies.

* * *

Though the nation of Lastwall is shattered and its leaders have fled, the courage of those who once defended its shining walls remains strong. The Knights of Lastwall are found in places of great calamity, escorting civilians and beating back the undead. Should the PCs ever venture into a crisis zone, they may likely as not see the Knights of Lastwall there as well, be they forming an armored wall to defend the innocent or creeping through deathly wastelands where even the bravest know mortal fear. Unless the PCs are evil or unwitting dupes of Tar-Baphon's agents, the Whispering Way, these knights mostly serve as precious allies in realms where friendly faces are rare. The virtuous defender could be a member of a knightly squad or a recruiter seeking those willing to risk their lives to save Avistan from a terrible peril. The veteran reclaimer is likely found in the depths of the Gravelands or other truly forsaken realms, where even the slightest misstep can lead to death or worse. Such cunning but virtuous souls might request help leading people to safety, act as a guide through unknown territory, or offer valuable advice and information about dangerous creatures or traps the PCs might risk encountering.
