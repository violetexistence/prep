_Face covered by a menacing helm and body clad in ornate plate, this figure projects an aura of immutable authority._

Each order of Hellknights is led by a powerful paravicar, a general in charge of dictating the order's tactics and the administration of its resources. Within the order, the word of these figures is law, and members from the lowliest squire to the most senior knight follow commands from a paravicar with unswerving devotion. Paravicars see their personal dedication to the order's edicts as an example for all members and hold themselves to the same high standards as their underlings. Though they seldom need to call upon them, paravicars use their considerable infernal powers to reinforce their positions in the Hellknight's hierarchy.

In combat, paravicars take direct command of their troops of knights and armigers. Paravicars are experienced campaigners who prefer calculated tactical gambits to hot-headed, risky maneuvers that could leave their forces exposed. If pressed into combat, paravicars use their abilities to demoralize their foes and compel enemies to become their allies or to flee the field.

* * *

Firm believers in enforcing the law at any cost, Hellknights are often based in Cheliax, but they travel to all across Golarion to enforce their ideals of order. This rigid viewpoint and intolerance for dissent means that PCs can just as easily find villains in these Hellknights as they can allies; an agent of the Hellknight Order of the Chain might aid the PCs in subduing a vile and violent criminal, or might hunt down the PCs due to mild infractions of unjust laws. The Hellknight armiger presented here might be an unrepentant enforcer seeking to quell rebellion among the oppressed, a dedicated monster hunter, a censor of artistic innovation, a savior to victims of kidnapping, a spy and torturer, or a lawful crusader against demonic incursions. Hellknight paravicars, meanwhile, are absolute exemplars of their orders, and PCs who encounter them will likely find themselves in the midst of momentous events.
