No two field agents follow the same path to join the Pathfinder Society, nor the same path once they embark on their first expedition. The Society's treacherous missions require all types of adventurers, from seasoned combatants to ruin delvers and experts in the occult. Some field agents are highly specialized, filling a single role in a larger group of Pathfinders, while others branch out into a broad range of abilities.

This field agent seeks the thrill of discovering lost treasures from the Inner Sea's many ancient ruins. She scouts ahead for her team, keeping an eye out for enemies, traps, and other dangers. In fights, she is cautious and practical, preferring to stay mobile and out of sight. She sneaks in for a finishing blow when victory is certain.

The Pathfinder Society is a large and influential organization seeking to learn and share their knowledge to others, and its members can be found even in the least likely of places. PCs who are members of the Pathfinder Society might accompany a Pathfinder field agent or get news and assignments from a Pathfinder venture-captain.
