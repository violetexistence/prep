There is perhaps nothing more anathematic to peace than an antipaladin. Dedicated holy warriors to the darkest and foulest of deities, antipaladins work to fulfill the vile wishes of their evil masters. The zeal with which they implement the plans of dark gods makes them truly fearsome foes for anyone allied with the forces of good.

Villains pursue selfish and cruel goals, trampling over anyone foolish or purehearted enough to stand in their way.
