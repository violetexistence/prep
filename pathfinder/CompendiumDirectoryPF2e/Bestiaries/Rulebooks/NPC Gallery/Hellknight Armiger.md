_This menacing dwarf wears a suit of armor emblazoned with the symbol of her Hellknight order, and she wields a mighty flail._

Armigers are the foot soldiers of the Hellknights and form the largest group of members for most orders. Whatever their specific reasons for joining the organization, armigers share the Hellknights' dedication to spreading the rule of law across Golarion. This commitment sees them serving in a variety of missions, whether it be rooting out bandits and crooks, imprisoning smugglers and black marketeers, or investigating rumors of sedition. While frontier villagers sometimes welcome the assurance of safety that the Hellknights bring, free thinkers and historians chafe at the restrictions on movement and expression that armigers enforce.

Although armigers are not yet full knights, those who underestimate them have made a grievous error. Once ordered to take a position or eliminate a foe, an armiger is unerring in fulfilling their order. During battle, they wade eagerly into the fray, targeting servants of chaotic gods and those they observe using underhanded tactics.

* * *

Firm believers in enforcing the law at any cost, Hellknights are often based in Cheliax, but they travel to all across Golarion to enforce their ideals of order. This rigid viewpoint and intolerance for dissent means that PCs can just as easily find villains in these Hellknights as they can allies; an agent of the Hellknight Order of the Chain might aid the PCs in subduing a vile and violent criminal, or might hunt down the PCs due to mild infractions of unjust laws. The Hellknight armiger presented here might be an unrepentant enforcer seeking to quell rebellion among the oppressed, a dedicated monster hunter, a censor of artistic innovation, a savior to victims of kidnapping, a spy and torturer, or a lawful crusader against demonic incursions. Hellknight paravicars, meanwhile, are absolute exemplars of their orders, and PCs who encounter them will likely find themselves in the midst of momentous events.
