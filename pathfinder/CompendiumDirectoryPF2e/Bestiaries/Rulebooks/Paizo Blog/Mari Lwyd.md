    desc: "  The Mari Lwyd is out simply to enjoy the season. The Mari Lwyd's attacks have the nonlethal trait when attacking creatures, unless those creatures attempt a hostile action on the Mari Lwyd first."

    desc: "  The Mari Lwyd cannot be disrupted by common means. It always knows if a building is truly unoccupied or if the occupants can speak and hear and are merely refusing to sing back, and it is immune to [[Spells/Silence|Silence]] and similar effects of up to 5th level."

  - name: "Festive Rampage"
    desc: "  **Requirements** The Mari Lwyd enters a building after winning the Pwnco, and was not both told to behave itself and offered alcohol or cheese\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The Mari Lwyd flies into a destructive celebratory rampage. As long as the Mari Lwyd remains in the building, it gains resistance 10 to all damage and its strikes ignore 10 Hardness. The Mari Lwyd loses the benefits of this ability if it attacks a living creature, and typically smashes furniture instead."

  - name: "Pwnco"
    desc: "`pf2:3`  The Mari Lwyd begins a rhyming contest, requesting entrance to a closed home, tavern, or other building that has occupants who can respond in it. It rolls a `Performance check` check. Before the Mari Lwyd's next turn, one occupant must respond to the Mari Lwyd's request by spending three actions to Perform a song of their own. The DC for the respondent's song is equal to the result of the Mari Lwyd's Performance check. If the building is occupied and no one responds, this has the effects of a critical failure.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The respondents win the Pwnco, causing the Mari Lwyd to depart.\n\n**Success** The response is good, and the Pwnco continues. The Mari Lwyd must use Pwnco again on its next turn. It takes a -2 circumstance penalty to its Performance check or increases its current circumstance penalty by 2, whichever is worse.\n\n**Failure** The respondents lose the Pwnco! The Mari Lwyd demands hospitality, causing the door to unlock and open and any barriers at the door to move out of the way. If the door is magically sealed, the Mari Lwyd attempts to counteract the effect (counteract rank 11, counteract modifier +22). If no occupant of the building offers the Mari Lwyd alcohol or cheese before the start of its next turn and demands that it behave itself, the Mari Lwyd can use Festive Rampage at the start of its next turn.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but due to the ineptitude of the response, the Mari Lwyd counteracts magical effects with a counteract rank of 15 and modifier of +30, and it must be offered twice as much alcohol or cheese."
