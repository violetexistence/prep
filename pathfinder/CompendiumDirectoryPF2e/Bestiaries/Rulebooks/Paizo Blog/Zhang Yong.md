  - name: "Reach Beyond"
    desc: "  Zhang Yong has learned to move his spiritual energy past himself to attack spirits where others can't. He can make melee Strikes against incorporeal creatures that are inside solid objects as long as the object is within his reach. An incorporeal creature inside of a solid object is hidden, requiring him to succeed at a `DC 11 Flat check` check when he targets it. He can spend an action, which has the concentrate trait, to focus on a creature inside of a solid object. If he does, the next melee Strike he makes this turn requires him to succeed at only a `DC 6 Flat check` check to affect the creature."

  - name: "Soul Dance Stance"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  Zhang Yong begins a stance that aligns him with the River of Souls and he can make soul strike attacks that seem almost incorporeal. These deal 1d8 bludgeoning damage; are in the brawling group; and have the agile, finesse, nonlethal, and unarmed traits. Soul Strikes treat cover against living and incorporeal undead targets as degree less severe (greater cover becomes standard cover, standard cover becomes lesser cover, and lesser cover is ignored)."
