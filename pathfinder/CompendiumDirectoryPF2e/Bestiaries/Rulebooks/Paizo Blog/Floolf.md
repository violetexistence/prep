    desc: "  Floolf pups are so adorable that any creature that is either a mammal, or has an Intelligence above 3 that sees or touches a floolf pup must succeed at a `DC 27 Will check` save or it will defend the floolf pup with its life. This effect ends when the creature is no longer able to perceive the pup.\n\nIf the creature can speak, anytime it remembers the floolf pup, it feels a compulsion (`DC 15 Will check` save) to tell their story of the encounter, invariably ending with the phrase, \"I would die for that floolf.\""
