The rt5rrmn is a catlike creature that loves to purr at those they encounter, convincing others to pamper them instead of fight. It would rather be friends than enemies, but if spooked it will viciously attack whoever is in its sights. If they aren't able to make friends, the rt5rrmn will quickly grow defensive, and leap to attack.
