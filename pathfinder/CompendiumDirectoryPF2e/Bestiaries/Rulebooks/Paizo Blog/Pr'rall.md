    desc: "`pf2:2`  **Requirements** You are wielding two melee weapons, each in a different hand.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Pr'rall lashes out at a foe with both weapons. Make two Strikes, one with each of his two melee weapons, each using his current multiple attack penalty. Both Strikes must have the same target. If the second Strike is made with a weapon that doesn't have the agile trait, it takes a -2 penalty. If both attacks hit, combine their damage, and then add any other applicable effects from both weapons. Add any precision damage only once. Combine the damage from both Strikes and apply resistances and weaknesses only once. This counts as two attacks when calculating multiple attack penalty."

He Strides up to his Speed. At any point during this movement, he can Strike once with each of the two required weapons. These Strikes can be against the same or different targets, as he sees fit."

  - name: "Flensing Slice"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** Pr'rall's last action was a Double Slice, and both attacks hit the target\n* * *\n\n**Effect** When Pr'rall hits with both attacks with Double Slice, he flenses the target, making it bleed and creating a weak spot. The target takes 2d8 bleed, becomes **[[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]]**, and its resistances to any physical damage types are reduced by 5; these two effects last until the beginning of Pr'rall's next turn."
