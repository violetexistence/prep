It remains potent only until the end of his next turn. When he throws this bomb, in addition to its normal effects, it creates a cloud of smoke in a 10-foot radius burst. Creatures in that area have the [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] condition, and other creatures are concealed to them. This smoke lasts for 1 minute or until dissipated by a strong wind."
