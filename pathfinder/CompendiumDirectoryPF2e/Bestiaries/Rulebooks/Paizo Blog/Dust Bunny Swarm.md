Dust bunnies in particular are prone to swarming. This can occur when a large number are left alone for a long period of time and are then disturbed by adventurers or a returning wizard. Other times, a singular dust bunny familiar grows in such numbers (and they will rapidly reproduce!) that a wizard cannot hope to keep them all placated with food and attention. In this situation, they will unionize in rebellion against their master.

It is paramount that you do not allow a dust bunny to multiply, for once a swarm has formed, they are nigh impossible to get rid of. While relatively easy to disperse and unlikely to kill anyone, they will re-form within the week unless the area is immaculately cleaned.
