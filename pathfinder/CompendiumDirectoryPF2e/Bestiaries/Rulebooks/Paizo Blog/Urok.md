    desc: "  Urok draws minor powers from his green draconic exemplar.

He gains resistance 9 against the triggering damage type, which applies against the triggering damage Urok can expend his daily use of Crystalline Dust when using this reaction. If he does, his daily use of isn't expended and he can use it a second time."
