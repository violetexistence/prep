    desc: "`pf2:r` (arcane, illusion, mental, visual) **Trigger** A creature enters the room\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Illusions cause the appearance of the room and the objects inside it to constantly warp, shift, bend, and distort for 1 minute. Each creature in the room while it's distorting must attempt a `DC 17 Perception check` check.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature disbelieves the illusions and is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature disbelieves the illusions but still sees them. It treats the room as difficult terrain.\n\n**Failure** The creature is fooled by the illusions. It treats the room as difficult terrain and becomes [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]]. As long as it remains in the room, it can't reduce its sickened value below 1.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but each time the creature Archive attempts a move action, it must succeed at a `DC 5 Flat check` or they lose the action, and on a critical failure, it also falls [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]."
