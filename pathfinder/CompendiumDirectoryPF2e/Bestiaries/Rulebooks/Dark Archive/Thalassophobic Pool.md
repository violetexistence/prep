    desc: "`pf2:r` **Trigger** A creature falls into the pool\n* * *\n\n**Effect** More water pours forth from the chalice. Creatures in the pool become [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]], and they can't decrease their clumsy condition so long as they remain in the pool. The trap then rolls initiative."

    desc: "(3 actions) Water from the chalice increases the depth of the water by 10 feet for each action. Each time this happens, creatures in the pool are pushed 10 feet down and take 1d6 bludgeoning damage. As the pool has no bottom, creatures in it can fall down indefinitely; they must [[Actions/Swim|Swim]] up to avoid drowning, but the water is especially choppy, so the Athletics DC is `DC 25 Athletics check`. The pool never overflows. Each successful check to Disable reduces the pool's actions by 1, and once the pool is completely Disabled, the water becomes still and the Athletics DC to Swim becomes `DC 10 Athletics check`."
