The hall becomes difficult terrain, and each creature in the hall is knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] unless they succeed at a `DC 26 Reflex check` save. The trap then rolls initiative."

    desc: "(4 actions) This trap loses 1 action each round for each wall that has been disabled. Each wall uses 1 action to slam back and forth rapidly, pummeling one creature in the hall with a wall Strike. On a hit, the target is additionally knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]. The walls distribute the attacks as evenly as possible among creatures in the hall, and the Strikes don't apply the trap's multiple attack penalty."
