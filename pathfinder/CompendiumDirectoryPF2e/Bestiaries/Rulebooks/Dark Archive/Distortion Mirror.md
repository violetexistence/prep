The creature takes 6d10 + 30 force damage and must attempt a `DC 39 Fortitude check` save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The target takes half damage and is [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] and [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]] for 1 round.\n\n**Failure** The target takes full damage and is [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 2]] and [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 2]] for 4 rounds.\n\n**Critical Failure** The target takes double damage and is clumsy 2 and enfeebled 2 for 1 minute. As long as the creature is clumsy or enfeebled, it additionally takes a -10-foot status penalty to its Speeds.\n\nWhen the effects of this trap end, the triggering creature's transformation ends, and its body reverts to its natural form."
