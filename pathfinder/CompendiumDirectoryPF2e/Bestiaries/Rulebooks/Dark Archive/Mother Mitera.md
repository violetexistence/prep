Any followers within 30 feet who failed their saving throw against the moonflower tea become [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]]. Anyone who critically failed and did not receive an antidote explodes (this is about half of Mitera's congregation if the PCs didn't successfully administer the antidote). If anyone's body explodes, Mitera gains 30 temporary Hit Points and is [[Conditions/Quickened|Quickened]] for 3 rounds; she can use this additional action each round only for Strike and Stride actions."
