    desc: "(1 action) The trap uses 1 action to blow powerful winds down the hall. Each creature in the hall must attempt a `DC 32 Fortitude check` save with the same results as Gust. If this forced movement would cause a creature to collide with a solid object or fall downstairs or out a window, that creature takes an additional 2d10 + 11 bludgeoning damage (or 20 bludgeoning damage due to a fall)."
