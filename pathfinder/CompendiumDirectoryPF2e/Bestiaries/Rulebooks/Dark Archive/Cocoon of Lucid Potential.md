    desc: "  The cocoon is incapable of movement beyond slight wriggling in place. It has no Speed and can't move or be moved, even through means such as teleportation, as the Weaver's threads tether it in place physically and astrally. The cocoon casts any spells psychically, substituting verbal and somatic components for expressions of pure unbridled will and removing the manipulate trait from its Cast a Spell action."

    desc: "  Killia's individuality still rests within the cocoon, yet trying to resist assimilation. If a PC succeeds at a `DC 32 Diplomacy check` check on the cocoon, the cocoon takes 5d6 mental damage and is [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]] as Killia's consciousness fights the Weaver. The cocoon can't be affected in this way more than once per turn."
