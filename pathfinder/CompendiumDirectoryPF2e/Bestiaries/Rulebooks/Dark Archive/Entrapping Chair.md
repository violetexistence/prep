A creature who succeeds at a `DC 22 Reflex check` save takes no damage and moves out of the chair's path into a random adjacent square not containing the track. A creature who fails this saving throw is knocked into the chair's seat and immediately captured by the armrests, becoming [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] ([[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]] on a critical failure; [[Actions/escape dc=26|escape dc=26]])."
