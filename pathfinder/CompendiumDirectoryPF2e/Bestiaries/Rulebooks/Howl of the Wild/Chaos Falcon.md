The extreme weather that gives birth to chaos falcons grants them a mix of abilities not found in other elemental birds. To them, lightning is as natural as fire and heat as comfortable as cold. The variability of their attacks makes them dangerous, even for the well prepared.

Like their elemental cousins, chaos falcons are often the harbingers of storms. They're also seen as omens of volcanic activity, as they will travel across great distances to play and dance in the resulting eruption. Between this association and their tendency to rain both fire and ice, their presence is considered dangerous by nearby settlements.

Fortunately, chaos falcons are solitary birds that prefer to stay away from the noise of civilization. They nest in volcanic vents or areas with geothermal activity, relying on the heat of the earth to incubate their eggs while hunting in the wilderness nearby. Unless their peace is disrupted or their safety threatened, they're unlikely to attack creatures that move through their habitat.
