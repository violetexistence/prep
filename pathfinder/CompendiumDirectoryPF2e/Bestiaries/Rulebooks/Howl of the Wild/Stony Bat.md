  - name: "Petrify Body Part"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (earth,primal) The stony bat breathes a puff of petrifying gas onto an adjacent creature, targeting a specific body part. The target must succeed at a `DC 20 Fortitude check` save or be partially petrified for 1 minute, with an effect varying with the body part targeted.\n\n*   **Face** The creature's face stiffens and a film of stone partially blocks its vision. It is [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]].\n*   **Hand** One of the creature's hands is petrified. It cannot Release items from that hand or use the hand for fine manipulation. Attack rolls with weapons held in that hand take a –2 status penalty.\n*   **Leg** A patch of the creature's leg becomes inflexible and heavy. It takes a –10 status penalty to its Speed. If all of the creature's legs become petrified in this way, the creature's Speed is reduced down to 5 feet. At the GM's discretion, a creature with movement that doesn't rely on legs, such as creatures that Fly with wings, don't take a penalty to these other Speeds."

  - name: "Petrify Vapor"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (earth,primal) The stony bat breathes petrifying gas in a 15-foot cone, too thin to harm creatures in the area. However, it petrifies ambient moisture, raining down a cascade of tiny stones onto any creatures in the space directly below the cone. The falling rocks deal 4d6 bludgeoning damage (`DC 20 Reflex check`). The stony bat can't use Petrify Vapor again for 1d4 rounds."

  - name: "Stone Feast"
    desc: "  The stony bat specifically targets petrified body parts, which it can consume, unlike flesh. The stony bat's jaws deal an extra 1d6 damage against a creature that has been petrified, either partially or completely, and ignore the Hardness of petrified creatures."

Gorgons are a broad group of animals that share a few peculiar traits. All gorgons are covered in armored plates and breathe petrifying gases. Other than these features, gorgons can resemble almost any animal. While some gorgons may seem like less physically imposing creatures, they should never be underestimated. Gorgons are canny hunters, and even a small puff of their breath can immobilize almost any prey.

* * *

These creatures resemble chubby bats covered in small overlapping metal plates. They can't exhale enough petrifying gas to paralyze a normal-sized humanoid, but it's effective on their usual prey of insects and other small animals, which they petrify before consuming. However, stony bats have learned how to use their petrification gas to defend themselves against larger creatures, freezing a limb or raining down pebbles of petrified water vapor.

Further, they can work together to bring down larger creatures, petrifying and consuming them limb by limb.

Stony bats generally live in caves in large groups, though they frequently fly out in small numbers for hunting. They typically aren't aggressive against non-prey they encounter outside, though they're very protective of their caves. Oreads and others who don't fear petrification sometimes keep stony bats as pets.
