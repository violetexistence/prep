Numerous species of sharks make their homes in the ocean's depths, rarely encountered by land-dwellers.

* * *

Goblin sharks are deep-sea hunters, dwelling near the ocean floor. They make up for their slow swimming speed with stealthy ambushes, allowing prey to get within reach before lashing out with their extending jaws.
