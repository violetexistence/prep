If any froglets have died, the concert frog attempts a `DC 11 Flat check` at the end of its turn; on a success, new froglets hatch in its stomach and emerge at the concert frog's lips."

These massive frogs store their eggs inside their stomach. When an egg hatches, the froglet crawls its way up into its parent's mouth to add its celebratory chirps and croaks to the family's song.
