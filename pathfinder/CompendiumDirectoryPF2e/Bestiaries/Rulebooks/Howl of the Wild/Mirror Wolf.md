  - name: "Bond with Mortal"
    desc: " (mental,primal) **Frequency** once per day\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The spirit guide spends 10 minutes to form a bond with a mortal creature. While the bond exists, the spirit guide increases their current and maximum Hit Points by 14, gains a +2 status bonus to their attack and damage rolls, and can communicate telepathically with the bonded mortal as long as the two beings are on the same plane. The spirit guide can only be bonded with one mortal at a time, and they can take this action again to end the bond or to form a new bond (which also ends the old bond). The bond also ends if the spirit guide or the mortal dies.\n\nThis bond strengthens the spirit guide's connection to the Universe. While bonded, the spirit guide loses the incorporeal and spirit traits, loses their immunity to disease, paralysis, and poison, along with their resistance to all damage, and changes their Strikes to deal the appropriate amount of physical damage (typically piercing or slashing) instead of force damage."
