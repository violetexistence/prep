The large scavenger birds known as scroungefeathers make their homes near the sites of large battles. These birds feast on blood and carrion and have quickly learned that battlefields provide both in abundance. In spite of this grisly diet, they're best known for another strange adaptation: they build their nests from pieces of armor, weapons, and magic items scavenged on the battlefields. This leaves young scroungefeathers remarkably well protected, allowing both parents to leave the nest to search for food.

Alarmingly, scroungefeathers have learned how to use the items they scavenge for their nests to fend off attackers, flinging arrowheads, thrashing about with knives, and even activating the occasional wand. A scroungefeather nest makes a tempting target for adventurers and thieves, as the treasures tucked within can be quite valuable, but the birds defend their nests fiercely, particularly when there are eggs or chicks inside.

While the feathers of scroungefeathers don't have any magical properties, they're popular among thieves. Insignia for thieves' guilds often include the image of a black feather with two crimson stripes, and such organizations often send new recruits to raid a scroungefeather nest as part of their training.
