Dischorans are a group of predators who hunt via focused sound. Though they possess protuberances that resemble eyes, these are actually auditory sensory organs that can pick up even the slightest sound and are used to locate prey with pinpoint accuracy.

Only a few types of dischorans have been identified, but they all share unifying features: front-facing pseudo-eyes, deceptive speed, and ravenous hunger. Their sensitivity to noise combined with their ability to weaponize sound are likely the primary reasons dischorans spend most of their time alone.

Morthaks, being low, squat, and flat, resemble a crocodile rebuilt to dig like a mole. At home beneath vast meadows and plains, the only sign of their passing are the earthen mounds they leave behind when they emerge to hunt. Those who encounter them in the wild speak of the sub-aural rumble they produce as they disintegrate the earth with sonic blasts, a sound that's felt rather than heard.
