This griffon is aptly named for both its majestic appearance in flight and its increased ferocity over the common griffon. Despite its size, the sheer muscle mass present in this creature makes flight seem effortless, if preposterous. It makes its home among the canopies of the most ancient forests and atop the peaks of the greatest mountains, hunting its prey from above with silent and deadly accuracy. The ascendant griffon prefers to hunt other large creatures within its territory, such as bears, but they will not hesitate to attack smaller prey they perceive as a threat to their territory. Whether an ascendant griffon is a new evolutionary development or a throwback to a more primeval version of the creature is difficult to determine. Further research into these exceptional creatures may provide insight into their origins and perhaps the origins of all griffons.
