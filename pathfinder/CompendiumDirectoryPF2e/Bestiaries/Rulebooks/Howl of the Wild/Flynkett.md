    desc: "`pf2:2`  The flynkett uses its skin flaps to form a crude kettle. While Kettled Up, the flynkett can't use its claw Strike or take move actions. If the flynkett has been Kettled Up for 1 minute or longer, and its kettle is full of water (usually due to the flynkett being in the rain), the flynkett's kettle begins to boil, emitting a piercing whistle that causes all creatures within 30 feet to take a â€“2 penalty to Perception checks to hear sources other than the flynkett; this is an auditory effect. The flynkett can stop Kettling Up as a free action."

The piercing whistle of the flynkett can often be heard over the harsh jungle rains, shrieking dissonantly when its cries combine with others of its pack. Although generally effective as a warning to nearby predators, these sharp cries also serve as a lure for reckless alchemists eager to study the creature's potent enzymes.

Flynketts' name, most theorize, is a corruption of "flinging kettle" or "flying kettle." They can't truly fly, instead using their skin flaps to glide in a manner similar to flying squirrels. However, the primary use of their skin flaps isn't for movement, but digestion. When it rains, flynketts roll up their loose skin, creating a crude sort of kettle in which to catch precipitation. The remarkable creatures' acid combines with the falling water to break down wood, soil, or even rocks into a nutritional stew. Therefore, the flynkett can flourish when introduced to any environment with frequent rain, something solid to stand on, and a lack of natural predators.

Although their acid can be harvested without harming a flynkett, the creatures rarely cooperate. If disturbed, particularly in the middle of feeding, they release clouds of acidic steam. They're also capable of spitting the fluid with deadly accuracy. Thankfully for those who run afoul of them, flynketts have no use for corpses and will generally break off pursuit when the interloper leaves their territory.

Several organizations and individual scholars have desperately sought to domesticate flynketts for use in alchemical production. To date, none of these efforts have been successful, though several abandoned labs still contain aggressive packs of flynketts who protect their new territory with ferocious tenacity.
