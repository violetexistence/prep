  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Greater Darkvision|Greater Darkvision]]"
    desc: "  A creature with greater darkvision can see perfectly well in areas of darkness and dim light, though such vision is in black and white only. A creature with greater darkvision can see through even forms of magical darkness."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Scent|Scent (Imprecise) 1 mile]]"
    desc: "  Scent involves sensing creatures or objects by smell, and is usually a vague sense. The range is listed in the ability, and it functions only if the creature or object being detected emits an aroma (for instance, incorporeal creatures usually do not exude an aroma).\n\nIf a creature emits a heavy aroma or is upwind, the GM can double or even triple the range of scent abilities used to detect that creature, and the GM can reduce the range if a creature is downwind."

  - name: "[[Creature Family Ability Glossary/(Warden of the Wild) Voice of Nature|Voice of Nature]]"
    desc: "  Though the Wardens of the Wild do not speak in words, they can communicate complex concepts flawlessly and wordlessly with any animal, beast, plant, or other creature of the natural world through prolonged eye contact. Sapient creatures with strong ties to the natural world, such as animal instinct barbarians or druids who speak the Wildsong, can somewhat understand a Warden of the Wild, though the meaning can be vague."

  - name: "[[Creature Family Ability Glossary/(Warden of the Wild) Warden's Crown|Warden's Crown]]"
    desc: "  A Warden of the Wild's horned crown commands respect from wild creatures. Wild creatures native to a warden's biome automatically improve their attitude toward it by one step (up to friendly) and typically do not take hostile actions towards each other while in the warden's presence."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/At-Will Spells|At-Will Spells]]"
    desc: "  The monster can cast its at-will spells any number of times without using up spell slots."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Constant Spells|Constant Spells]]"
    desc: "  A constant spell affects the monster without the monster needing to cast it, and its duration is unlimited. If a constant spell gets counteracted, the monster can reactivate it by spending the normal spellcasting actions the spell requires."

  - name: "Wild Trickery"
    desc: "`pf2:r` (mental,primal) **Trigger** An enemy within 60 feet targets the warden with an attack, spell, or other ability\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The triggering creature must attempt a `DC 45 Will check` save. If it fails, the warden redirects the ability to target a different creature in range with a burst of mental laughter; this has no effect if there are no other eligible targets. The triggering creature is then temporarily immune for 24 hours unless it critically failed."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Change Shape|Change Shape]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,polymorph,primal) The monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block.\n* * *\n\nThe warden transforms his size to Tiny, Small, Medium, or Huge (changing his reach to 0 feet for Tiny, 5 feet for Medium or Large, and 10 feet for Huge). The warden retains his shape but can change his color to any seasonal array."

  - name: "Forest Passage"
    desc: "  The Warden of Forests and Meadows ignores difficult terrain and greater difficult terrain from non-magical foliage."

  - name: "Fox's Wager"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,mental,primal) The warden grants a boon to a willing creature he can see other than himself, requesting that the creature promise to use the granted power to destroy or undermine the creations of civilization. The target gains a +1 status bonus to attack rolls and a +5 status bonus to damage against constructs, objects, and structures constructed by humanoids. It also gains a +2 status bonus to Stealth checks against humanoids. The warden can have only one wager granted at a time. The wager ends if the target is captured or dies.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Fox's Wager|Effect: Fox's Wager]]"

  - name: "Idyllic Panorama"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,primal) **Frequency** once per hour\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The warden creates an area of peaceful calm. This is identical to a 5th-rank [[Spells/Mirage|Mirage]] depicting a peaceful meadow or forest, except the area is a 200-foot burst.\n\nWhile within the area of an Idyllic Panorama, the warden has significant control over the senses of creatures within the area and can cast [[Spells/Mislead|Mislead]] and 2nd-rank [[Spells/Silence|Silence]] at will."

  - name: "Magical Pounce"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  The warden Strides up to his Speed, Leaps up to his Speed, or casts [[Spells/Translocate|Translocate]]; at the end of that movement, the warden Strikes. If the warden began this action [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]], he remains hidden until after this ability's Strike."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Sneak Attack|Sneak Attack]]"
    desc: "  The warden deals an additional 3d6 precision damage to [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] creatures."
