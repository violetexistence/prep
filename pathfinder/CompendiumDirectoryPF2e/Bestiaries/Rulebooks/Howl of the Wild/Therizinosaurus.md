At first glance, the therizinosaurus, with its rotund, feathered body and bird-like beak, strikes many observers as almost comical. This impression tends to quickly fade at the sight of the creature's claws, six wicked, scythelike blades capable of disemboweling a foe with a single well-placed slash. Despite their intimidating appearance, these enormous claws are used primarily to separate tasty leaves and branches from the tops of the tall trees upon which the therizinosaurus feeds. Nonetheless, travelers through a therizinosaurus's territory are wisely advised to give the creature a wide berth, less they wind up on the wrong end of its notoriously foul temper.
