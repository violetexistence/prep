    desc: "  While unable to communicate for prolonged periods, a mocking chorus can precisely imitate a humanoid voice. If a creature speaks within audible range of the mocking chorus, the mocking chorus can speak using the creature's voice, even if it says different words than what were spoken. Creatures that hear the mocking chorus speak this way can attempt a `DC 40 Will check` save to recognize the source. On a success, creatures gain a +1 circumstance bonus to all saving throws against the mocking chorus' abilities for 1 minute."

    desc: "  The hydra has regeneration equal to 3 × the number of heads it has. If a hydra's body is missing any heads and the remaining stumps have not been cauterized, the hydra attempts a `DC 43 Fortitude check` save after it regains Hit Points from regeneration. On a success, one uncauterized stump regrows two heads; on a critical success, two uncauterized stumps regrow into two heads each. The hydra can never grow more than double the number of heads it ordinarily has. The hydra's regeneration only fully deactivates if all its heads are severed and all stumps are cauterized, at which point it dies."

  - name: "[[Actor.FUnnTzkARhfNi5cP.Item.tHcAM0IJtyMBlTXA|Head Regrowth]]"
    desc: "  A mocking chorus ordinarily has ten heads. A creature can attempt to sever one of the hydra's heads by specifically targeting it and dealing damage equal to the head's Hit Points. A head that is not completely severed returns to full Hit Points at the end of any creature's turn. A hydra can regrow a severed head using hydra regeneration. A creature can prevent this regrowth by dealing acid or fire damage to the stump, cauterizing it. Single-target acid or fire effects need to be targeted at a specific stump, but effects that deal splash damage or affect areas covering the hydra's whole space cauterize all stumps if they deal acid or fire damage. If the attack that severs a head deals any acid or fire damage, the stump is cauterized instantly. If all ten heads are cauterized, the hydra dies.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Hydra Heads|Effect: Hydra Heads]]"

    desc: "  A hydra gains an extra reaction per round for each of its heads beyond the first, which it can use only to make Reactive Strikes. It can't use more than 1 reaction on the same triggering action, even if a creature leaves several squares within its reach, and the hydra must use a different head for each Reactive Strike it makes. Whenever one of the hydra's heads is severed, the hydra loses 1 of its extra reactions per round."

Among the many unique creatures of the Inner Sea, the hydras known as mocking choruses that stalk the River Kingdoms may be one of the most reviled. While as ferocious in direct combat as others of their kind, chorusus are a singular type of challenge for warriors that hunt them due not to their sharp teeth, but instead a sharp and subtle tongue. Their strangely cunning tactics and power to turn longtime friends into bitter enemies brings doubt to even the closest of allies.

Mocking choruses exhibit behavior that seem to indicate a more elevated intelligence than other hydras. They do not appear to eat in large quantities, leaving little sign they have passed by and spurring rumors that they prey on settlements more for sport than sustenance. Every few years sees a new story of a whole village turning on itself. Neighbor against neighbor, the village tears itself apart; some go missing, and only the sounds of hissing laughter precede the event.
