It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

Werecreatures are humanoids who transform into animals and animal-humanoid hybrids under the light of the full moon. The fate of these shapechanging creatures derives from an ancient primal curse that they can, in turn, transmit through their own bites. The stat blocks in this section reflect werecreatures in their hybrid forms.

* * *

A weremoose's tendencies toward stubbornness and a grumpy attitude make it difficult for them to get along with others. Most often, they live as hunters or hermits, taking in the peace of their natural surroundings. If their territory is invaded, they don't hide or retreat but are unlikely to attack. If someone else starts the fight, though, a weremoose retaliates without mercy.
