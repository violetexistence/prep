Dischorans are a group of predators who hunt via focused sound. Though they possess protuberances that resemble eyes, these are actually auditory sensory organs that can pick up even the slightest sound and are used to locate prey with pinpoint accuracy.

Only a few types of dischorans have been identified, but they all share unifying features: front-facing pseudo-eyes, deceptive speed, and ravenous hunger. Their sensitivity to noise combined with their ability to weaponize sound are likely the primary reasons dischorans spend most of their time alone.

* * *

Drthaks are aquatic predators with long trailing fins that are rarely seen, clinging to coasts and estuaries where the high silt content makes them practically invisible to predators and prey alike. Some have been known to come inland, tracking their prey miles upriver before striking. The underwater environment alters the typical dischoran hunting behavior, with drthaks creating bubbles that implode to stun prey.
