Decapod dinghies are massive crabs indigenous to the Okaiyo Ocean that often assist the local humanoids with transportation. They can understand Thalassic and are instantly recognizable by the colorful anemones they carry on their backs and in their front claws. Athamarus and merfolk are common sights atop decapod dinghies, lounging comfortably amidst the anemones and sharing food with their hosts.

This peaceful cooperation is indirectly caused by the legendary crustacean Tehialai-Thief-Of-Ships. Since Tehialai's rampages are a constant threat in the Okaiyo, the ancestors of the decapod dinghies bonded with other marine life to survive. Decapod dinghies' relationship with anemones is particularly tight, using the small creatures as poisonous extensions of their own bodies and using their response to movements in the water to compensate for the decapod dinghy's otherwise poor vision. In a region wracked by Tehialai's storms, everyone needs to band together, after all.
