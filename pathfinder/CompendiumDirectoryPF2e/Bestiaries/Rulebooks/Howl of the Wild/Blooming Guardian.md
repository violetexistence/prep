At the start of their turn in any round that the blooming guardian deals damage with siphoning buds, they gain 10 temporary Hit Points, plus 2 temporary Hit Points for each creature damaged beyond the first since the blooming guardian's last turn, to a maximum of 20 temporary Hit Points."

The pestilent blossoms adorning the antlers of a blooming guardian are most beautiful in moonlight, when they achieve full bloom and reveal their celestial glow. When blooming guardians near the end of their life cycle, they walk one final patrol of their forest as their ancient body decomposes into the understory.
