The pestilent blossoms adorning the antlers of a blooming guardian are most beautiful in moonlight, when they achieve full bloom and reveal their celestial glow. When blooming guardians near the end of their life cycle, they walk one final patrol of their forest as their ancient body decomposes into the understory.
