Karkadanns are a distant relation to unicorns, favoring more open terrain than their woodland kin. With the build of a buffalo, karkadanns have gray, scaly bodies, thicker hooves, and no mane. Despite their territoriality and harsh temperament, many karkadanns can be befriended by those who truly hold respect for nature in their hearts.
