The majungasaurus prowls in a crouched posture, carrying its bulk so low to the ground it is eye-to-eye with its prey. Unlike most carnivorous dinosaurs, the majungasaurus is primarily an ambush predator, patiently lying in wait for quarry to come within reach before bursting from cover with a signature cry to attack.
