Desert manticores are far more dangerous than their common cousins and only marginally cleverer. Instead of the usually spiked tail reminiscent of a porcupine, desert manticores have large scorpion tails, requiring them to adopt closer approaches and cunning ambushes. Desert manticores are known for their egos and constant attempts to outmatch sphinxes within their chosen territories. No accounts of such attempts have ever proved fruitful for the desert manticore.
