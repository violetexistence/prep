Mammoth land stars are unrelenting predators that move silently towards their potential meals on hundreds of tubular feet. There are several variations, but the most common have a diameter ranging from 8 to 12 feet and five total limbs. These mindless creatures weather any and all challenges in their hunt to devour their prey, using their superior sense of smell and keen observation of nearby movement to stalk prey from afar. Their paralytic venom and rapid digestive process spell a quick end for unsuspecting creatures caught in their grasp.

Travelers who survive a mammoth land star's assault must take care to destroy the remains, as its regenerative ability will eventually revive it to continue its mission: feed. It is not uncommon for mammoth land star attacks to happen in succession one week after another, with greater numbers each time. This is often caused by leaving limbs to regrow and resume their initial attack.
