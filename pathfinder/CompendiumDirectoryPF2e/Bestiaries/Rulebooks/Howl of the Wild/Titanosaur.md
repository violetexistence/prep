Titanosaurs are some of the largest land animals ever to walk the surface of Golarion, massive sauropods that can reach over 100 feet in length and weigh more than 80 tons. While typically content to focus on consuming vast quantities of vegetation and ignore the presence of smaller creatures, titanosaurs that feel threatened can unleash destruction rivaling natural disasters.
