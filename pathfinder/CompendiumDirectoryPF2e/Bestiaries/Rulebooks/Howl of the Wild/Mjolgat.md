Over the millennium that they mined the rich mineral deposits of the Shattered Range, the dwarves of Dongun Hold discovered the stalwart mjolgat, a beast that exhibits the uncanny ability to sniff out ore deposits with its incredible sense of smell. To this day, dwarves across Golarion rear mjolgats as companions and draft animals, training them to locate precious metals [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] deep beneath the surface. Some dauntless dwarves even turn mjolgats into mounts, though those brave enough to do so often require ample ear protection, as the creatures release horrifying shrieks when threatened.

Exhibiting a temperament that rivals even a dwarf's surliness, mjolgats have large, cranial crests of bone as broad and heavy as the head of a giant's warhammer. While the rest of their face resembles a cross between an elephant and a yak—with elongated snouts, rodentlike muzzles, and a two sets of horns—their bodies resemble those of squat boars. A straggly mane of thick brown fur covers their massive necks, which develop and strengthen over their life spans to support the massive columns of bone atop their heads. Adolescent mjolgats often lack such athleticism, walking backward and dragging their heads behind them until they can hold their necks upright. A dwarf down on their luck is often compared to a young mjolgat unable to lift their head off the ground.
