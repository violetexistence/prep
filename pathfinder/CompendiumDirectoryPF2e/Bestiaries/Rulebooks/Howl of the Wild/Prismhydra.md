  - name: "Hydra Regeneration"
    desc: "  The hydra has regeneration equal to 3 Ã— the number of heads it has. If a hydra's body is missing any heads and the remaining stumps have not been cauterized, the hydra attempts a `DC 39 Fortitude check` save after it regains Hit Points from regeneration. On a success, one uncauterized stump regrows two heads; on a critical success, two uncauterized stumps regrow into two heads each. The hydra can never grow more than double the number of heads it ordinarily has. The hydra's regeneration only fully deactivates if all its heads are severed and all stumps are cauterized, at which point it dies."

  - name: "Prismatic Head Regrowth"
    desc: "  A prismhydra ordinarily has eight heads. A creature can attempt to sever one of the hydra's heads by specifically targeting it and dealing damage equal to the head's Hit Points. A head that is not completely severed returns to full Hit Points at the end of any creature's turn. A hydra can regrow a severed head using hydra regeneration.\n\nEach head requires a different type of damage to cauterize; typically, two heads each are vulnerable to acid, cold, electricity, and fire damage, but other combinations or more exotic vulnerabilities are possible. When a prismhydra successfully regrows heads, all the heads regrown have the same vulnerability, which must be the same as the vulnerability of one of the prismhydra's unsevered heads.\n\nIf all eight heads are cauterized, the hydra dies.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Hydra Heads|Effect: Hydra Heads]]"

  - name: "Reactive Heads"
    desc: "  A hydra gains an extra reaction per round for each of its heads beyond the first, which it can use only to make Reactive Strikes. It can't use more than 1 reaction on the same triggering action, even if a creature leaves several squares within its reach, and the hydra must use a different head for each Reactive Strike it makes. Whenever one of the hydra's heads is severed, the hydra loses 1 of its extra reactions per round."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Reactive Strike|Reactive Strike]]"
    desc: "`pf2:r`  **Trigger** A creature within the monster's reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The monster attempts a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, the monster disrupts that action. This Strike doesn't count toward the monster's multiple attack penalty, and its multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike."

The most commonly seen hydra famously has five heads that it uses in unison to attack prey or assailants. Scattered across the Inner Sea region are more fantastical breeds of the beast, each with their own curious evolution and hunting behavior.

* * *

Prismhydras, yet another inexplicable byproduct of the Mana Wastes' tumultuous magical properties, wander the land between Nex and Geb feasting on megafauna, mutants, and whatever else happens to cross their path. Their scales cascade in various colors, shifting in beautiful patterns that belie the threat of their powerful jaws. Only the most prepared adventurers can slay a prismhydra, for the means of stopping its regeneration is like a single card in an explosive deck.
