    desc: "  When a magnegor takes damage from a metal weapon or an effect with the metal trait, it takes 5 untyped additional damage and must succeed at a `DC 5 Flat check` or become [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]].

    desc: " (earth) The magnegor inadvertently digs a 10-foot-deep continuous trench in any square it Wallows through, as long as the ground in that space isn't made of stone, rock, or some other surface too hard to excavate. The trench is greater difficult terrain. At the GM's discretion, any excavated square can reveal a deposit of sedimentary rock filled with metal ore that has Hardness 7 and 28 Hit Points."

  - name: "Magnetized Coat"
    desc: "  When a magnegor comes within 30 feet of a metal object or a deposit of metal ore, its thousands of wiry hairs stand on end, pointing towards the metal and creating a magnetic field. Metal items of light or negligible Bulk that touch the magnegor's coat adhere to it magnetically, requiring an Interact action to be pried free. Creatures wearing or primarily composed of metal treat all squares in a 10-foot radius around the magnegor as difficult terrain, unless they are moving directly towards it."

    desc: "`pf2:3` (move) **Requirements** The magnegor is [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The magnegor rolls on its spine-covered back, up to its Speed, furrowing the earth and crushing any Large or smaller creatures in its path. This deals 4d10 piercing damage with a `DC 24 Reflex check` save; on a failed save, a creature wearing metal armor or made of metal is [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]] by the magnegor's magnetized coat ([[Actions/Escape|Escape]] DC 24). For each metal object or piece of equipment a restrained creature chooses to leave stuck to the magnegor, it gains a +1 circumstance bonus to its attempts to Escape. A creature that relinquishes all its metal Escapes automatically. The magnegor can move at its full Speed while it has a creature restrained in this way, bringing the creature along."

Magnegors roam the mountains of Golarion, grazing on wild berries, edible roots, and other plants that favor iron-rich soil and high elevations. These hulking, woolly bovines have four curved horns—two extending from behind their ears, and two from below their jaws—that frame their skulls in an X shape. Their bodies are covered in thick, stringy hair with a texture akin to copper wire, parted only by massive neural spines of dense, nearly indestructible keratin.

Magnegors display a unique ability to manipulate magnetic fields through their coats and spines and have a strange predilection for crushing metals and precious ores by wallowing over them back and forth. As a result, unwary adventurers who accidentally wander into the middle of a magnegor herd rarely, if ever, make it out alive.
