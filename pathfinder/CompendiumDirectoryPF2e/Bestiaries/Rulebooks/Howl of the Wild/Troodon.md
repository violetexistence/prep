    desc: "`pf2:1`  The troodon repeats up to twelve words it heard in the last week. If it succeeds at a `Deception check` check against the listeners' Perception DC, the sound is indistinguishable from the original. The troodon can't duplicate voice-based abilities or spells, although it can mimic the verbal sounds of spellcasting."

Troodons stand roughly 3 feet tall and twice as long, with slender necks and large, inquisitive eyes. Although they don't fully understand language, troodons have a remarkable talent for speech mimicry.
