Dischorans are a group of predators who hunt via focused sound. Though they possess protuberances that resemble eyes, these are actually auditory sensory organs that can pick up even the slightest sound and are used to locate prey with pinpoint accuracy.

Only a few types of dischorans have been identified, but they all share unifying features: front-facing pseudo-eyes, deceptive speed, and ravenous hunger. Their sensitivity to noise combined with their ability to weaponize sound are likely the primary reasons dischorans spend most of their time alone.

Often mistaken for drakes, soniphaks glide above rocky or barren ground, picking out prey with their hearing. A hunting soniphak disables its targets with concentrated bursts of sound before snatching them up and feasting on the move. Despite being able to speak, soniphaks are no more social than other dischorans, generally responding to even the quietest attempts at communication with destructive shouting.
