    desc: "  This monster regains the listed number of Hit Points each round at the beginning of its turn. Its [[Conditions/Dying|Dying]] condition never increases beyond Dying 3 as long as its regeneration is active. However, if it takes damage of a type listed in the regeneration entry, its regeneration deactivates until the end of its next turn. Deactivate the regeneration before applying any damage of a listed type, since that damage might kill the monster by bringing it to Dying 4."

  - name: "Disharmonious Decay"
    desc: " (poison) When a spawn dies, its foulness seeps into the land in a 100-foot radius. Non-magical plant life in the area decays within 1 hour, and new non-magical growth can't sprout for 1 month. A creature can act on the spawn's corpse within 1 minute of its death to limit this decay to a 10-foot square by succeeding at a `DC 22 Medicine check`, `DC 22 Nature check`, or `DC 22 Occultism check` check."

Kothogaz's presence causes the land to sprout festering hives. Insectile, acid-drooling spawn slither from these growths as lesser versions of their creator.
