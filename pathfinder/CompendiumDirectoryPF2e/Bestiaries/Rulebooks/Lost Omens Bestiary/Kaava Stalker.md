Kaava hunting parties can number in the dozens, although they blend easily into the forest and cover all traces of their passage. While community elders assign various tasks to hunting parties, such as recovering food or deterring intruders, the parties are expected to accomplish these tasks as they see fit.

Kaava are stealthy, jungle-dwelling humanoids with short down feathers that can easily be mistaken for fur from a distance. Kaava have tough scales beneath these feathers. Both the scales and feathers have mutable pigmentation that allows a kaava to blend into surrounding foliage like a chameleon.
