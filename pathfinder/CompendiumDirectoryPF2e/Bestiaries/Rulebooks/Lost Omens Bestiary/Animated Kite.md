An animated kite is perfect for spying, allowing observation from a great distance, although many are treated more like pets. The kite itself is a simple handcraft, easily created and destroyed, made of enchanted paper stretched over a fine bamboo frame. More advanced kites can be decorated with a variety of runes that allow the enchanter to see or hear from a distance.
