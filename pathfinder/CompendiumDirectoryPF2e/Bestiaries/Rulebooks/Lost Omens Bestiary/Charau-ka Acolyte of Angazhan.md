Even with the Gorilla King's fall, many charau-ka still worship the terrible might of the god Angazhan. The strongest of these acolytes guard the steps of the High Throne in Usaro, ensuring that no one without Angazhan's favor or suitable physical prowess can approach the top of the massive stone step pyramid.

Legend tells that charau-ka share ancestry with the demon lord Angazhan, who transformed the dead bodies of humans who waged war against his cult, causing them to rise as the first of the mandrill-like humanoids. Though long unproven, rumors persist that charau-ka priests have perfected a hideous ritual that forces the slain to reincarnate as new charau-ka in honor of this ancient tale. Other stories say that powerful altars devoted to Angazhan contain this power, and that conducting ritual sacrifices before these magical artifacts causes the spirits of the dead to return to life as violent devotees of Angazhan, the master of those who revel in savagery and destruction.

The largest charau-ka stronghold in the Mwangi Expanse is the city of Usaro, located on the shores of Lake Ocota. Though the death of their Gorilla King has led to political turmoil, the charau-ka will happily unite to kidnap or murder any outsiders in the area.
