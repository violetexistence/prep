A nue is an ancient creature of enormous size and destructive power. Though sightings are rare, it's described as having the head of a monkey, the body of a tanuki, the limbs of a tiger, and a snake for a tail. The beast's eerie body is matched by its ability to drain the life force of those around it just by howling.

According to certain tales, in ancient times, a nue would freely terrorize kingdoms and inflict nightmares upon it victims. It first appears as an enormous storm cloud before turning a poisonous black color. When angered, a nue can summon lightning to cause massive amounts of collateral damage. Hearing a nue's howl is considered an ill omen.
