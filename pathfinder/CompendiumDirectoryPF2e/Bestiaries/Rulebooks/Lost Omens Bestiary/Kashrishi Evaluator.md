    desc: "  Kashrishi evaluators can get a vague sense of the current emotional state of all other creatures within 15 feet of them, as long as the kashrishi evaluator is aware of those creatures. This manifests as a general feeling of happiness, anger, or fear, without any specific details. Additionally, any creature who succeeds at masking or faking their emotions using Deception projects the deceptive emotions instead of their true feelings. For those that kashrishi have an emotional connection with, physical touch can heighten this sense to greater degrees of detail and understanding, increasing with the strength of their bond."

To some, kashrishi seem to be a quiet, passive people. Those with a deeper understanding know that there's plenty more nuance to interacting with kashrishi, who possess innate psychic abilities that greatly alter the way they communicate with the rest of the world. Unable to turn off their powers, these abilities add a complex dynamic to interpreting their surroundings. Without deeper understanding of a person, kashrishi are only able to get the most vague, general feelings from people around them. This becomes more refined as their relationships evolve; family and friends are often the easiest to engage in psychic communication, while strangers simply add to the amount of mental noise a kashrishi must process.

Kashrishi resemble rhinoceroses, with soft, textured skin that can range from light sandy hues to darker obsidian, or rarer jewel tones of deep sapphire or ruby. The size and number of their horns vary. Kashrishi communities are generally quite welcoming to others, enjoying the conversation and unique auras of every new stranger. However, chaotic environments can overwhelm and overstimulate kashrishi not yet adept at filtering psychic energies, leaving some with limited tolerance for extensive social interaction with strangers and requiring they take periods of time to refocus after socializing. In spite of this possible drawback, kashrishi are typically strong communicators, excelling at roles that require attention to detail.
