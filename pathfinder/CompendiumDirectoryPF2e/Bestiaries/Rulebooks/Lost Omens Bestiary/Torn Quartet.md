  - name: "Bound Limbs"
    desc: "  A torn quartet ordinarily has four severed limbs tethered to a central point by near-incorporeal ropes. A limb is essentially cut away from the central point and rendered nonfunctional each time the torn quartet loses 60 Hit Points (so at 180 Hit Points, the torn quartet has three functional limbs, at 120 Hit Points, it has two functional limbs, and so on). Each functioning limb can [[Actions/Grapple|Grapple]] separate creatures within reach, or multiple functioning limbs can Grapple the same creature; for each additional limb used to Grapple a creature, the [[Actions/Escape|Escape]] DC increases by 2."

  - name: "Reactive Strike"
    desc: "`pf2:r`  **Trigger** A creature within the monster's reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The monster attempts a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, the monster disrupts that action. This Strike doesn't count toward the monster's multiple attack penalty, and its multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike."

  - name: "Replacement Parts"
    desc: "  A torn quartet can spend 1 minute tearing apart the corpse of a humanoid creature that was killed within the last hour to regain 60 Hit Points and restore one of its nonfunctioning limbs. A torn quartet can't have more than four limbs."

  - name: "Void Healing"
    desc: "  A creature with void healing draws health from void energy rather than vitality energy. It is damaged by vitality damage and is not healed by vitality healing effects. It does not take void damage, and it is healed by void effects that heal undead."

attacks:
  - name: ""

  - name: "**Melee** `pf2:1` Limb"
    desc: "+25 (agile, magical, reach 15 feet)\n__Damage__  3d8 + 13 bludgeoning plus *Improved Grab*"

  - name: "Flurry of Limbs"
    desc: "`pf2:2`  The torn quartet makes a number of limb Strikes up to its number of functioning limbs, each against a different target. These attacks count toward the torn quartet's multiple attack penalty, but the multiple attack penalty doesn't increase until after the torn quartet makes all its attacks."

  - name: "Split Reactions"
    desc: "  A torn quartet has a number of reactions per round equal to its number of still-functioning limbs, which it can use only to make Reactive Strikes. It can't use more than 1 reaction on the same triggering action, even if a creature leaves several squares within its reach, and the torn quartet must use a different limb for each Reactive Strike it makes. Whenever one of the torn quartet's limbs is rendered nonfunctional, the torn quartet loses one of its reactions."

  - name: "Tear Asunder"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** The torn quartet has a creature grappled or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]] by at least two limbs\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The creature takes 5d6 slashing damage for each limb currently grabbing or restraining it (maximum 15d6), with a `DC 30 Fortitude check` save. On a critical failure, the creature also loses a random body part, and one of the torn quartet's limbs is now no longer grabbing or restraining it."
