Variant wolf

To survive living in the Worldwound, Sarkorian wolves developed defenses against the Abyss. They've become symbols for Mendevian crusaders who struggled to adapt to the world after the war ended.

Wolves roam forests, hills, and other wild lands, where they hunt in packs to beleaguer and surround their prey before going in for the kill. Like most predatory animals, wolves prefer to attack the weakest or most vulnerable prey they can find.
