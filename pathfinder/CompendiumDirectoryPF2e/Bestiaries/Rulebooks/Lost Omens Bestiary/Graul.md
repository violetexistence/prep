  - name: "Sound Mimicry"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  The graul can perfectly imitate the sounds and speech of other creatures by attempting a `Deception check` check against a listener's Will DC. The graul doesn't need to understand the language it's mimicking, but when speaking a language it doesn't know, the creature can only repeat specific words and phrases it has heard in the past 24 hours. The graul can't use this ability to duplicate voice-based abilities or spells."

  - name: "Tentacle Grab"
    desc: "  A creature hit by the graul's tentacle becomes [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] by the graul. The creature isn't [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]], but it can't move beyond the reach of the graul's tentacle. A creature can sever the tentacle with a Strike against AC 18 that deals at least 10 slashing damage. This deals no damage to the graul but prevents it from using its tentacle Strike until it regrows the tentacle, which takes 1 round. The graul can move without ending the Grab as long as the creature remains within the tentacle's reach."

The labyrinthine caverns and tunnels beneath Highhelm are home to many dangers, with the insidious graul being one of the more notable native species. These highly specialized ambush predators possess a natural camouflage that renders them completely imperceptible to all forms of darkvision as they float silently through the darkness, allowing them to hunt creatures that rely on specialized senses to navigate their lightless domain. Surprisingly cunning, grauls are adept at using their magical talents for illusion and mimicry to separate potential prey from allies and light sources alike.
