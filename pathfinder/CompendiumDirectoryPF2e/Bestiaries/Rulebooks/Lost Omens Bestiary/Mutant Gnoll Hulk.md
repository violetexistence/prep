The erratic magical energies of the Mana Wastes can warp and twist creatures foolish or unlucky enough to be trapped in them. The physiological effects of this exposure vary in scope from grotesque full-body transformations to more subtle changes to the skin or senses, and they're frequently accompanied by changes in disposition, motivation, or temperament.
