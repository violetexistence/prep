Its [[Conditions/Dying|Dying]] condition never increases beyond Dying 3 as long as its regeneration is active.

Deactivate the regeneration before applying any damage of a listed type, since that damage might kill the monster by bringing it to Dying 4."

When Somnalu is defeated, its central eye abandons its dying body to create an ethereal body from the wisps of dreams. Over centuries-or sooner, if it can find a powerful source of nightmares-it can re-form a full body and return to its corporeal self.
