Taljjae can't don a broken mask.\n\nWhen Taljjae Changes Characters, it gains access to the listed abilities. Any items (such as weapons) associated with its previous mask immediately disappear and are replaced by fresh ones for its new mask, but the effects of any mask abilities it has active persist. Removing a mask and later reapplying it doesn't restore any limited-use abilities."

The form of Taljjae's body can vary from visit to visit or even moment to moment, but it's easily recognized due to its signature cloak and masks. So long as Taljjae's mood is placid, it can be approached safely, but its mercurial temperament can be hard to predict.
