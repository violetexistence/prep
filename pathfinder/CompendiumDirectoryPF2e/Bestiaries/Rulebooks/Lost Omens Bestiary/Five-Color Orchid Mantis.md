Few creatures appear as beautiful as the orchid mantises. Their elegant form and coloration resemble flowers, and many people adopt the delicate creatures as short-lived pets. While these mundane insects aren't dangerous to humanoids, they can still bring down prey several times their own size. Unfolding from their flowery pose, orchid mantises lash out with blinding speed, even chasing foraging butterflies with their sharp-toothed arms and powerful bite.

* * *

Orchid mantises naturally live short lives that don't offer a great deal of time to gather spiritual energy. However, a mantis in a rich enough environment can extend their life span and grow to understand the elements. These creatures become five-color orchid mantises and, despite their violent attitudes, are thought to be especially sacred to Qi Zhong. As such, these dangerous mantises are often avoided or placated while gathering herbs rather than driven off.
