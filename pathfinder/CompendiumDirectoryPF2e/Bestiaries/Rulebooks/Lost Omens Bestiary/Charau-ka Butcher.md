While charau-ka are infamous for their brutality, some even frighten their own kind in their obsession with violence. These deadly butchers are well-versed in the art of inflicting vicious, bloody wounds on their enemies, and they consider anyone not charau-ka an enemy. A single taste of a foe's blood can grant one terrifying strength, as if the charau-ka butcher literally gains power from their victims' pain.

Legend tells that charau-ka share ancestry with the demon lord Angazhan, who transformed the dead bodies of humans who waged war against his cult, causing them to rise as the first of the mandrill-like humanoids. Though long unproven, rumors persist that charau-ka priests have perfected a hideous ritual that forces the slain to reincarnate as new charau-ka in honor of this ancient tale. Other stories say that powerful altars devoted to Angazhan contain this power, and that conducting ritual sacrifices before these magical artifacts causes the spirits of the dead to return to life as violent devotees of Angazhan, the master of those who revel in savagery and destruction.

The largest charau-ka stronghold in the Mwangi Expanse is the city of Usaro, located on the shores of Lake Ocota. Though the death of their Gorilla King has led to political turmoil, the charau-ka will happily unite to kidnap or murder any outsiders in the area.
