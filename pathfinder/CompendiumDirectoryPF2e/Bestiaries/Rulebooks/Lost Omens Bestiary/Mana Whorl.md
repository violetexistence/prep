    desc: "This 15-foot-wide patch of destabilized sand attempts to submerge creatures who wield magic. A desert tree with dense bright green foliage, pale pink blooms, and at least one carnivorous red-chested magpie is always nearby."

    desc: "`DC 26 Arcana check` (expert) to feed magic into the whorl and temporarily stabilize it for a few minutes; feed the whorl a number of spellcasters and magic items with a combined 10 levels (for instance, a 4th-level cleric with two 3rd-level magic items) to stabilize it for 1 week; or feed the whorl a number of spellcasters and magic items with a combined 20 levels to stabilize it permanently. Spellcasters and magic items fed to the whorl are devoured whole."

    desc: "`pf2:r` **Trigger** A creature who can cast spells, or who is wielding a magic item, walks into the mana whorl\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The triggering creature sinks into the whorl to its waist. The whorl rolls initiative if it hasn't already."

  - name: "Routine"
    desc: "(1 action) On its initiative, the whorl pulls down any creature within it that can cast spells or that is wielding a magic item. A creature submerged to the waist becomes submerged to the neck, and a creature submerged to the neck is pulled under and must hold its breath to avoid suffocation. If a creature has no spells or magic items, the mana whorl is merely difficult terrain. A creature caught in a mana whorl can attempt a `DC 23 Athletics check` check to Swim to either raise itself by one step if submerged to the neck or worse, or to move 5 feet if submerged only to the waist. On a critical failure, the creature is pulled down by one step. A creature that Swims out of the whorl escapes the hazard and is [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] in a space adjacent to the whorl. Other creatures can Aid the creature, typically by using a rope or similar aid, or attempt to pull the creature out with their own `DC 23 Athletics check` check, with the same results as if the creature attempted the check. If a creature has only magic items and no ability to cast spells, dropping all the items releases that creature, and it can move through the mana whorl as normal difficult terrain."
  - name: "Reset"
    desc: "The hazard continues to suck in anyone with magic until it is satiated (see Disable above). Magpies leave any satiated whorls."
