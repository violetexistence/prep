When a person drowns in a body of water, there's a chance that their spirit will be trapped and unable to reincarnate. Twisted with anger, spite, and malice, the spirit transforms into a shui gui.

If someone sees a shui gui from shore, they'll often see only the top part of a head with two pinprick reflections of light from its eyes. Lurking under docks and near the water's edge, the shui gui calls out to people or makes disturbances to draw them within reach of the water. Once the unsuspecting victim is close enough, the spirit pulls them underwater, drowns them, and possesses their body in a process known as ti sh-on. Once the spirit successfully inhabits the vacant body, they escape their curse and live a new life; however, their victim's spirit remains trapped in the water until, at last, they too drown a hapless passerby, thus continuing a never-ending cycle.

A shui gui is terrified of fire, and those who camp by water or travel by boat are advised to always keep a lantern handy. Charms and amulets can also keep the shui gui at bay, but the spirit is generally weakest after being goaded onto land.
