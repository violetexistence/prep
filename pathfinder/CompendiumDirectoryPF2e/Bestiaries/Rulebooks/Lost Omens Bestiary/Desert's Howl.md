    desc: "  This monster regains the listed number of Hit Points each round at the beginning of its turn. Its [[Conditions/Dying|Dying]] condition never increases beyond Dying 3 as long as its regeneration is active. However, if it takes damage of a type listed in the regeneration entry, its regeneration deactivates until the end of its next turn. Deactivate the regeneration before applying any damage of a listed type, since that damage might kill the monster by bringing it to Dying 4."

  - name: "Aura of Agony"
    desc: " (aura,emotion,fear,mental) 10 miles. Desert's Howl exudes a massive psychic disturbance many miles away from its location, assaulting the minds and spirits of those who dare to sleep within the unsettling bounds of its aura of agony. Creatures that attempt to rest while they're within this emanation are beset by disturbing nightmares and hallucinations, regardless of whether they're aware of Desert's Howl's presence. This restlessness causes creatures to wake up [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]], and they don't recover from fatigue by resting. Creatures affected by aura of agony don't reduce their [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened]] condition by resting as long as they remain within the area of the aura."

  - name: "Fear Scent (Precise) 120 feet"
    desc: "  Desert's Howl can observe any frightened creatures within 120 feet using an incredibly accurate sense of psychic smell as a precise sense. However, its fear scent extends further if the creature was frightened by Desert's Howl. The taste of such a bouquet of fear in the air becomes irresistible and easy for Desert's Howl to detect, like a shark smelling blood in water. Desert's Howl can sense a creature frightened by its own fear effects as an imprecise sense at a distance of up to 1 mile away."

    desc: "`pf2:3` (auditory,emotion,fear,mental) Desert's Howl vents a long and desolate wail full of nightmares and despair. The devastating howl can be heard up to 1 mile away under the open sky. Any creature who hears it experiences a sudden sinking in its stomach and heart palpitations, its hair stands on end, and it must attempt a `DC 38 Will check` save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected and becomes temporarily immune for 1 hour.\n\n**Success** The creature becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]].\n\n**Failure** The creature becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 3]].\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature becomes [[Conditions/Doomed|Doomed 1]], [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 4]], and is [[Conditions/Fleeing|Fleeing]] for 1 round."

  - name: "Illusory Ambush"
    desc: "`pf2:2`  Desert's Howl shimmers with illusions and devastates a foe who lost track of its position. Desert's Howl Strides up to twice its Speed. If it ends its movement within its melee reach of at least one enemy to which it's undetected, it can attempt two claw Strikes against that enemy. These attacks count toward Desert's Howl's multiple attack penalty, but the multiple attack penalty doesn't increase until after Desert's Howl makes both of these attacks. Desert's Howl remains undetected to the creature it's attacking until after resolving both of the claw attacks."

  - name: "Nightmare Fuel"
    desc: "  Desert's Howl's claws are infused with some of the nightmares that make up Desert's Howl's being, and they infect victims with lasting fear, cycling their victims' fears and anxieties in a horrific loop that takes time and rest to break. A creature that takes damage from Desert's Howl's claw Strike while frightened no longer reduces its [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened]] condition at the end of each turn. Instead, the creature can only decrease its frightened condition by 1 after each full night's rest or with magical effects counteracting the fear, such as [[Spells/Clear Mind|Clear Mind]]."

  - name: "Paralytic Secretion"
    desc: "  Desert's Howl's saliva is a potent paralytic substance that drains the energy from prey. A creature hit by its spit Strike must succeed at a `DC 41 Fortitude check` save or become [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 2]] as well as [[Conditions/Paralyzed|Paralyzed]] for 1 round. If the target was already drained, it instead increases the condition's value by 1, to a maximum of drained 4."

  - name: "Profane Feast"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** Desert's Howl has a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]]\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Desert's Howl begins to consume the creature, dealing 2d12+15 piercing damage (`DC 41 Fortitude check` save) and exposing the creature to its paralytic secretion."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Improved Grab|Improved Grab]]"
    desc: "  **Requirements** The monster's last action was a successful Strike that lists Improved Grab in its damage entry, or the monster has a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]\n* * *\n\n**Effect** If used after a Strike, the monster attempts to [[Actions/grapple|grapple]] the creature using the body part it attacked with as a free action. This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead spend an action to use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

  - 1: Desert's Howl
```



Desert's Howl is a towering, gray abomination with a shape vaguely similar to that of a bearded man with glowing yellow eyes, long ibex horns, deadly black claws, and cloven hooves. These features have sometimes caused those who encounter it to mistake it for some kind of fiend, a fatal mistake likely to lead to their demise, as Desert's Howl is in truth a twisted aberration composed of a disgusting mix of nightmares, smoke, and ash. As such, holy water and other measures that might be effective against fiends have no effect on Desert's Howl.

According to the oral histories of the people who have survived in the Thuvian desert the longest, when Desert's Howl first appeared, it was in much the same shape but no larger than a human. Over time, its proportions lengthened and grew, as did its frightening abilities and appetite for suffering.

Given the incredible range on Desert's Howl's namesake desolate exclamation, creatures are much more likely to hear Desert's Howl than see it. Though such forewarning potentially gives distant creatures additional time to prepare to face or escape the creature, Desert's Howl enjoys the steady build-up of fear that this approach allows, potentially breaking its victims' resolve long before it even appears. Besides, a creature of its power has little to fear from travelers, or even most adventurers, regardless of how much time they have to prepare. In the end, a greater struggle just makes destroying them all the sweeter.
