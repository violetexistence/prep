    desc: "`pf2:1` (arcane,concentrate,polymorph) The anadi changes into their hybrid form, spider form, or human form. The above statistics assume the anadi is in their hybrid form. While in their human form, the anadi elder can't use their fangs attack and loses their climb Speed. When in spider form, they can't use weapons.\n* * *\n\nThe monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

Anadi elders must make the difficult decision of whether to continue negotiations or to escalate a disagreement to outright conflict.

* * *

Anadis are peaceful, reclusive humanoids who live deep within woodlands, jungles, and other untamed areas of wilderness. Their natural forms resemble humanoid spiders covered in beautiful and distinctive markings of varying colors. These patterns are as unique as other humanoids' facial features, birthmarks, and other identifying aspects.

Anadis possess an innate talent for illusion and transmutation. They learned long ago how off-putting their natural forms can be to other humanoids, so they frequently use their innate talents to assume human forms. When they do so, only a strange, lovely sheen to their dark eyes and the deliberative, jerky movements of their gestures might indicate that an anadi is not entirely what they appear. As they are well aware of and accommodating toward other humanoids' delicate sensibilities about arachnids, many anadis consider it rude to show their natural forms to a stranger. Instead, most display their spider-like forms only as an intimidation tactic when threatened, or in privacy to those they trust.

Most anadi tend to be shy and seek to live quiet lives harvesting mushrooms and weaving beautiful, patterned silk cloth. When forced into combat-an eventuality most anadis despise-they shift into their hybrid forms as soon as possible, allowing them to inflict their devastating natural venom on their foes.
