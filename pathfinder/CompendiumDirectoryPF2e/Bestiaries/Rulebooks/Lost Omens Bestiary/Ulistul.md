    desc: "  **Frequency** once per round\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Ulistul directs one construct within 60 feet that can perceive her and has a level lower than hers, delivering helpful commands that improve its capabilities. The construct gains a +1 status bonus to attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Artificer's Command|Effect: Artificer's Command]]"

  - name: "Artificer's Eye"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (arcane,scrying) Ulistul chooses one construct or statue she can currently perceive with a precise sense or with statuesense; usually, her only precise sense is vision. After choosing her target, she begins to perceive the target's surroundings as though she occupied its space. If the target is either an inanimate statue or a mindless creature, she can also verbally interact with nearby creatures (including issuing Artificer's Commands) or cause the target to move subtly, such as moving its mouth. This ability can be sustained indefinitely as long as Ulistul can perceive the target, though her visual stimuli from her own body are harder to process; she's [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] when using her own senses for the effect's duration."

    desc: "`pf2:2` (arcane,incapacitation) Ulistul takes control of a construct within 30 feet. This has the effects of [[Spells/Dominate|Dominate]](`DC 32 Will check`) but can affect mindless creatures and ignores the target's golem antimagic, if any."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Grab|Grab]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** The monster's last action was a successful Strike that lists Grab in its damage entry, or the monster has a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]\n* * *\n\n**Effect** If used after a Strike, the monster attempts to [[Actions/grapple|grapple]] the creature using the body part it attacked with. This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."
