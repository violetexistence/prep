    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,divine,polymorph) The bibliodaemon can take on the appearance of any Small or Medium humanoid. This doesn't change their Speed or their attack and damage modifiers with their Strikes, but it might change the damage type their claw Strikes deal (typically to bludgeoning).\n* * *\n\nThe monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

Bibliodaemons are four-armed, weasellike daemons who personify death by paperwork and incompetent bureaucracy. They're often attracted to places where bureaucrats abuse power or cut corners at the expense of the citizens. By disguising themselves as government officials, the bibliodaemons worsen the problems, forging or losing important documents and escalating the complexity of the bureaucracy. Eventually, major infractions—such as the imprisonment or execution of an innocent person—begin to tear the community apart. The people descend into paranoia and mistrust of their officials, leading to either a revolt against these local governments or complete apathy due to the lack of power to affect change.

Most bibliodaemons work alone to cause this kind of chaos, but in some instances, these fiends have been used strategically. After all, once an area has descended into turmoil, it's easy for another party to step in and take over. During the civil war in Cheliax, bibliodaemons were sometimes summoned to destabilize areas in grabs for power. While none will admit it, bibliodaemons have been present during the various coups and government changes throughout the Shining Kingdoms.
