    desc: "`pf2:1` (stance) **Frequency** once per round\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Taljjae removes its current mask and dons a new one. The change refreshes Taljjae, restoring 25 Hit Points. Once Taljjae has removed a mask, it can't Change Characters back to that mask until it has worn all of its unbroken masks at least once, after which the cycle starts again. Taljjae can't don a broken mask.\n\nWhen Taljjae Changes Characters, it gains access to the listed abilities. Any items (such as weapons) associated with its previous mask immediately disappear and are replaced by fresh ones for its new mask, but the effects of any mask abilities it has active persist. Removing a mask and later reapplying it doesn't restore any limited-use abilities."

  - name: "Waypoints"
    desc: "  Taljjae leaves behind images of itself as it travels. Whenever it makes a Strike, it leaves behind a ghostly image of itself that lasts until the beginning of its next turn. These images block movement for Taljjae's enemies, and they provide flanking to Taljjae and its allies."

The form of Taljjae's body can vary from visit to visit or even moment to moment, but it's easily recognized due to its signature cloak and masks. So long as Taljjae's mood is placid, it can be approached safely, but its mercurial temperament can be hard to predict.

The slightly upturned smile of this mask depicts a sense of joy and wonder at travel and new experiences.
