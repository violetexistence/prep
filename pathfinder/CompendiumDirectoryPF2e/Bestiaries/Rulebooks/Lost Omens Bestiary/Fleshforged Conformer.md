    desc: "  This monster regains the listed number of Hit Points each round at the beginning of its turn. Its [[Conditions/Dying|Dying]] condition never increases beyond Dying 3 as long as its regeneration is active. However, if it takes damage of a type listed in the regeneration entry, its regeneration deactivates until the end of its next turn. Deactivate the regeneration before applying any damage of a listed type, since that damage might kill the monster by bringing it to Dying 4."

This doesn't change the conformer's Speed or their attack and damage bonus with their Strikes, but might change the damage type their Strikes deal."

  - name: "Surgical Detachment"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,manipulate,morph,occult) The conformer detaches part of their body to serve them as an autonomous organism. For the next 24 hours, the conformer gains the loyal service of a fleshforged [[Lost Omens Bestiary/Skinskitter|Skinskitter]]. As long as they remain within 1 mile of each other, the conformer can use the Surgical Detachment action again to empathically direct the actions of their skinskitter servant as well as perceive through its senses. Due to how taxing this process is, the conformer can have only one skinskitter servant at a time."

The target must attempt a `DC 26 Fortitude check` save; on a failure, they become [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]] and take damage from their persistent bleed damage, even though it isn't the end of their turn."

  - name: "Wear Flesh"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (occult) **Requirements** The conformer has used Tissue Siphon to absorb flesh within the last hour\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The conformer expends the flesh they've absorbed to transform their body, reproducing the effects of one of the following spells: [[Spells/Adapt Self|Adapt Self]], [[Spells/Enlarge|Enlarge]], [[Spells/Shifting Form|Shifting Form]], [[Spells/Tentacular Limbs|Tentacular Limbs]], or [[Spells/Unusual Anatomy|Unusual Anatomy]]. The Wear Flesh action gains the traits of the spell it's reproducing, and the conformer can Sustain a Spell on these effects."

Shapeshifting fleshforged conformers have adapted to survive Ecanus's high-magic, population-dense sprawl. Resembling blocky humanoid skeletons splotched in uneven layers with cartilage and muscle, conformers are capable of attaching and detaching flesh from their bodies, often sending autonomous gobbets of fat and ligament to observe living creatures and harvest biological material.

Fleshforged conformers use their resources to augment and change their bodies, which helps them infiltrate Nexian society to better understand the arcane principles and occult secrets behind their creation. Some assume the guises of humans and animals to lead quiet, settled lives in Nex, but most are discovered and summarily exterminated as defects and threats to public safety.
