    desc: "`pf2:r`  **Trigger** Ainamuuren takes at least 40 points of physical damage from a single attack, and he isn't currently discorporated\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Ainamuuren discorporates into a whirling blizzard for 3 rounds. During this time, he gains resistance 10 to physical damage and weakness 10 to force damage. He gains a fly speed of 40 feet, but the only action he can take is to Fly. While discorporated, the first time each round that Ainamuuren enters another creature's space or a creature enters Ainamuuren's space, that creature takes 4d8 cold damage and must succeed at a `DC 34 Fortitude check` save or be [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]]. At the start of his turn, Ainamuuren can end this effect as a free action."

    desc: "  Ainamuuren is marked by the runes of the saumen kar, a gift tied to their ancient curse. Ainamuuren gains a +1 status bonus to saving throws against evil and necromancy spells and effects. He can sense the presence of evil undead as a pervasive taste of oily corruption in the air. This is a vague sense that allows him to know when such a creature is within 60 feet, though he can't precisely pinpoint their location with this sense. This sense also extends to living creatures who have the void healing ability, like dhampir."

    desc: "`pf2:2` (cold,primal) **Frequency** once per day\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Ainamuuren activates the runes covering his body to create an icy prison around a Huge or smaller creature he can see within 60 feet. The prison is a sphere made of unmelting ice, just large enough to fit his target. The target, and any creatures sharing its space, must attempt a `DC 34 Reflex check` save. A creature that fails becomes trapped inside the prison. If it succeeds, the creature is pushed outside the prison into a space of its choice. If the target shares its space with a gargantuan creature, the effect fails.\n\nThe dome has AC 10, Hardness 20, and 40 Hit Points; and is immune to cold, critical hits, and precision damage. The prison lasts until destroyed, until Ainamuuren uses this ability to create a new prison, or until he dies."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Knockdown|Knockdown]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** The monster's last action was a successful Strike that lists Knockdown in its damage entry\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The monster attempts to [[Actions/trip|trip]] the creature. This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the monster's multiple attack penalty."

Like all saumen kar, Ainamuuren is a large, muscular humanoid with large horns atop his head. Thick, white fur covers everywhere except his face, hands, and feet, which reveal darker skin beneath the fur, covered in an intricate pattern of stylized runes. Unlike other saumen kar, Ainamuuren possess not two but four long, curving horns, jutting from his head like a primal crown. The large, magical greataxe he carries bears intricate, stylized runic patterns that greatly resemble those carved upon his flesh, with the same sharp focus on angular lines and triangular shapes.
