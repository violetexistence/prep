This manifestation appears as the rotting upper half of the walcofinde protruding from the wall, but their skin is patterned as if they were the same structural material as the wall they're emerging from. While manifested, the walcofinde's claw attack gains a reach of 10 feet, but they can move only by using Wall Glide. Any damage done to the manifestation affects the walcofinde themself. A walcofinde can Dismiss their structural possession to retreat back into their sealed chamber."

    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate) **Requirements** The walcofinde is manifested using Structural Possession\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The walcofinde's manifestation Strides, submerging into the wall and reemerging from the wall at the end of their movement. If the walcofinde takes 2 actions to Wall Glide, their manifestation can Stride twice before reemerging. In either case, they can move only within walls that are within 100 feet of their sealed chamber."

Forever entombed, walcofindes are vengeful undead creatures inhabiting the enclosed spaces in which they were sealed and eventually perished. As they ultimately succumbed to a slow death by starvation and suffocation, walcofindes are similar to zombies in their hunger and rage. What sets them apart are their vicious claws of stone-sharpened bone, protruding through worn down, fleshless fingers as a result of desperate and futile attempts to escape.

Walcofindes are bound to their death site. These "wall-coffined" undead can manifest their forms within the structure where they were sealed, possessing the walls and stealthily traversing along them. Walcofindes' manifestations adopt the patterned appearance of the structure's materials, but not its physical properties. They take the form of hungry, grasping humanoid torsos emerging from the walls like harrowing extensions of their eternal prison. Unable to ever fully leave their structures, these undead are destined to be a part of it forever.

Despite their decaying forms, walcofindes retain the intelligence they would've had in life; for example, a walcofinde who was previously a soldier could understand enemy tactics and assess the appearance and equipment of their foes, allowing them to strategize and prioritize targets as well as organize with other nearby walcofindes to formulate an attack.
