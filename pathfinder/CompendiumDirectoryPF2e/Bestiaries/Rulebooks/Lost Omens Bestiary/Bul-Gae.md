  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Scent|Scent (Imprecise) 60 feet]]"
    desc: "  Scent involves sensing creatures or objects by smell, and is usually a vague sense. The range is listed in the ability, and it functions only if the creature or object being detected emits an aroma (for instance, incorporeal creatures usually do not exude an aroma).\n\nIf a creature emits a heavy aroma or is upwind, the GM can double or even triple the range of scent abilities used to detect that creature, and the GM can reduce the range if a creature is downwind."

    desc: " (aura,darkness,occult) 100 feet.\n\nLight and shadows morph strangely around the bul-gae. Non-magical bright light is reduced to dim light within the aura. When a creature attempts an action within the aura that has the light trait, it must attempt a `DC 34 Will check` save. On a failure, the action is disrupted."

After using this ability, the bul-gae's flames cool, and they can't use Solar Flare again until after they've used their Lunar Burst ability."

Bul-gaes are manifestations of the eclipsed sun and moon. They look like large canines, though their coloration and features change as they exercise their powers over heat and cold. Depending on whether they've most recently unleashed their lunar or solar powers, bul-gaes resemble either a crimson hound wreathed in flames or a cerulean, frostbitten fox, respectively.

Legends say that the first bul-gae attempted to steal the sun from the sky. As they bit down on the burning sphere, though, the bul-gae was badly burned. Having failed, they then tried to retrieve the moon, but when they touched the moon, the bul-gae froze solid and fell to the ground. The descendants of that bul-gae forever hone their powers of flame and ice so that they might one day succeed where their ancestor failed.

Tales say that bul-gaes serve as faithful companions to the ancient, shadowy master of the first bul-gae. These stories purport that the shadow master can see through the distorted light of all bul-gaes and use the hounds as a means to watch the universe for unknown purposes.
