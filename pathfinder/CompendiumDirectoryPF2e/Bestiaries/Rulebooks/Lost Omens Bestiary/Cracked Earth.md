    desc: "`pf2:r` **Trigger** A creature steps onto the cracked earth\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The creature fractures the thin crust of earth and falls through. That creature can use the [[Actions/Grab an Edge|Grab an Edge]] reaction to avoid falling, as long as it is adjacent to an edge. Otherwise it takes falling damage (typically 25 bludgeoning damage for a 50-foot drop). Some of these rifts eventually lead to the Darklands."
