    desc: "  This monster regains the listed number of Hit Points each round at the beginning of its turn. Its [[Conditions/Dying|Dying]] condition never increases beyond Dying 3 as long as its regeneration is active. However, if it takes damage of a type listed in the regeneration entry, its regeneration deactivates until the end of its next turn. Deactivate the regeneration before applying any damage of a listed type, since that damage might kill the monster by bringing it to Dying 4."

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

While Desert's Howl is presumed to be unique, given its inexplicable origin, there have been reports of creatures resembling Desert's Howl that stalk the sands of Thuvia. Though quite similar to the descriptions of Desert's Howl, they seem to be individuals who haven't yet fully completed their transformation into the terrifying beast. Whether these unfortunate people met a cruel fate similar to that which spawned Desert's Howl or are spawn of the nightmarish creature itself is unclear. Some reports of encounters with these creatures note that it's possible to revert the creature back to its humanoid form by cleansing its mind of nightmarish visions, though there's no solid evidence of such an event ever occurring.
