Few creatures appear as beautiful as the orchid mantises. Their elegant form and coloration resemble flowers, and many people adopt the delicate creatures as short-lived pets. While these mundane insects aren't dangerous to humanoids, they can still bring down prey several times their own size. Unfolding from their flowery pose, orchid mantises lash out with blinding speed, even chasing foraging butterflies with their sharp-toothed arms and powerful bite.

These mantises have grown to an unusual size, which makes their camouflage less effective in most environments. As such, they're usually found in areas where a blossom the size of an adult human could pass as normal, in the lushest rainforests, or in lands where rare medicinal herbs are cultivated. Tame giant orchid mantises can also be found protecting those rich enough to afford such decorative guards.
