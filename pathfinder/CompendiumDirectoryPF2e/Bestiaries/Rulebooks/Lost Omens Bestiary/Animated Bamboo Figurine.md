Supple but strong bamboo strips woven into intricate patterns form the base of the animated bamboo figure. These materials are plentiful and easy to come by, though they require great care and patience to prepare, making them ideal guardians for isolated communities. These hollow and pliable handcrafts can stretch or compress, jumping and springing farther than most humanoids.
