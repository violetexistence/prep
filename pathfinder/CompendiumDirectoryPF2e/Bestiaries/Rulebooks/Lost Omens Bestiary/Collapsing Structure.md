    desc: "The GM rolls a `DC 9 Flat check` to determine if the building partially collapses, increasing the DC as listed above. On a successful check, dust and debris fall within the building and 30 feet around it, providing concealment and dealing 6d6 bludgeoning damage to 1d4 randomly chosen targets (`DC 35 Reflex check` save; on a critical failure, the creature is knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]). On a critical success, the effect is the same, but the debris deals 12d6 bludgeoning damage to 2d4 randomly chosen targets instead (`DC 35 Reflex check` save; on a critical failure, the creature is [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]] by rubble until freed [[[Actions/Force Open|Force Open]] DC 38, [[Actions/Escape|Escape]] DC 35])."
