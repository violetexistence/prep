The sakhil keeps the same visage for 24 hours or until they steal another."

Ijhyeojins (ee-jyuh-jeens) were once joseung sajas, psychopomps who guided the dead to the Boneyard as divine punishment for their sins. Over time, they rejected their roles and became sakhils. Some did this due to a sense of injustice over having to atone for their sins in the afterlife, but all do so partially out of a desperate desire to reclaim their memories—for ijhyeojins are named for the fear they manifest, the fear of being forgotten. They prey on people who are socially isolated by circumstances or those obsessed with their legacy, slowly cutting their victims off from friends, professional contacts, and family. Ijhyeojins particularly enjoy infiltrating medical facilities to prey on patients who fear about being forgotten in their deaths, snatching away crucial memories from them or their visiting loved ones. Hunting in this way also grants the sahkils ideal positioning to lure joseung sajas to their demise.

Ijhyeojins resemble the pale-skinned psychopomps they used to be, except their faces have no distinguishable features, like a skull with a smooth layer of skin pulled over it. Their bodies continue to twist and grow the longer they live.
