Wavesense functions only if monster and the subject are in the same body of liquid, and only if the subject is moving through the liquid."

    desc: " (aura,olfactory) 20 feet. A creature entering the aura or starting its turn in the aura must succeed at a `DC 20 Fortitude check` save or become [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] ([[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]] on a critical failure).

    desc: "`pf2:r`  **Trigger** The Skinned Steed enters a space adjacent to the Kallas Devil\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The Kallas Devil mounts the horse."

  - name: "Skinned Steed"
    desc: "  The Kallas Devil has a horse minion known as the Skinned Steed. The horse has a swim speed equal to its standard Speed and the minion trait, and it's under the control of the Kallas Devil. The Kallas Devil automatically succeeds at all checks to Command the Skinned Steed. While mounted on the Skinned Steed, the Kallas Devil fuses with the horse, causing the two to become a single being. The Skinned Steed doesn't act on its own while fused with the Kallas Devil, instead acting as the Devil's legs to move around the battlefield. The Kallas Devil doesn't command the Skinned Steed in this state and instead replaces her Speeds with the mount's speeds until she dismounts. While the two are separated, the Kallas Devil needs to Command the Steed, as normal. If the Skinned Steed is killed, the Kallas Devil can replace it by spending 1 day to prepare another horse, converting it into her new Skinned Steed."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Aquatic Ambush|Aquatic Ambush]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** The monster is hiding in water and a creature that hasn't detected it is within the listed number of feet.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The monster moves up to its swim Speed + 10 feet toward the triggering creature, traveling on water and on land. Once the creature is in reach, the monster makes a Strike against it. The creature is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] against this Strike."

  - name: "Call Steed"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (auditory) **Requirements** The Skinned Steed hasn't been killed and is within 60 feet\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The Kallas Devil whistles loudly and calls for her steed, prompting the creature to Stride twice toward the Kallas Devil."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Change Shape|Change Shape]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,occult,polymorph) The Kallas Devil can take on the appearance of any Medium or Small female humanoid. This doesn't change her Speed or her attack and damage bonuses with her Strikes but might change the damage type her Strikes deal (typically to bludgeoning).\n\nThe monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

  - name: "Devil's Charge"
    desc: "`pf2:2`  **Requirements** The Kallas Devil is mounted on the Skinned Steed\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The Kallas Devil Strides twice. If she ends her movement within melee reach of at least one creature, she can make a melee Strike against that creature."

  - name: "Flay Alive"
    desc: "`pf2:3` (attack) **Requirements** The Kallas Devil has a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]], and it has been grabbed since her last turn.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The Kallas Devil flays her prey, dealing 2d12+17 slashing damage, and the target must attempt a `DC 25 Fortitude check` save. On a failure, it becomes [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]] ([[Conditions/Drained|Drained 2]] on a critical failure). On a critical success, the creature escapes from being grabbed; otherwise, the Kallas Devil extends the grabbed condition until the end of her next turn."

  - name: "Sewer Haze"
    desc: " (disease,virulent) Many healers and alchemists suspect that sewer haze has a supernatural origin, given its association with particularly strong otyughs.\n\n**Saving Throw** `DC 23 Fortitude check`\n\n**Onset** 2 days\n\n**Stage 1** [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] (1 day)\n\n**Stage 2** [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 2]] and stupefied 2 (1 day)\n\n**Stage 3** [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 3]] and [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 3]] (1 day)"

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Grab|Grab]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** The monster's last action was a successful Strike that lists Grab in its damage entry, or the monster has a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]\n* * *\n\n**Effect** If used after a Strike, the monster attempts to [[Actions/grapple|grapple]] the creature using the body part it attacked with. This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

Bearing a resemblance to the flayed nuckelavee that lurks in stagnant swamps, the Kallas Devil distinguishes herself by being able to separate herself from her mount without issue, as well as with her powers of disguise and subtlety. Though her wicked trident and violent fury are enough to sear her image into the minds of the local people, it's the Kallas Devil's ability to slip unseen among her would-be victims that elevates the creature beyond the ranks of a common horror. No matter how careful the residents of Riverton are with their youth and the vulnerable, the Kallas Devil claims her chosen target more often than not, luring the hapless victim toward doom while wearing a smiling child's face.
