If the grabbed or restrained creature has an ongoing emotion or mental effect with a counteract rank of 4 or lower, the imperfect automaton can gain a copy of that effect that lasts for 1 minute.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Mortal Reflection|Effect: Mortal Reflection]]"

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."
