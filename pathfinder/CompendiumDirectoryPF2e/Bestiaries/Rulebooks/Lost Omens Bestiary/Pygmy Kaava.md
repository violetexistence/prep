An unusually large number of kaava living in the Kaava Lands are relatively small, standing about 3 feet tall and weighing about 30 pounds. Pygmy kaava openly show their disdain for larger kaava, and the two groups rarely get along. Pygmy kaava often hunt alongside trained bush vipers or black mamba snakes.

Kaava are stealthy, jungle-dwelling humanoids with short down feathers that can easily be mistaken for fur from a distance. Kaava have tough scales beneath these feathers. Both the scales and feathers have mutable pigmentation that allows a kaava to blend into surrounding foliage like a chameleon.
