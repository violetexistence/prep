The Mosquito Witch is a humanoid figure with unpleasant, waxy skin. She always seems to have her head bowed and her shoulders hunched, a mane of unkempt black hair hiding all of her face save for a pair of unblinking red eyes and a long, sharp tongue that's as stiff and pointed as a proboscis. Fleshy, ribbed mosquito wings protrude from her back. She has six handless arms that taper into malformed points, which she keeps clutched to her chest like the legs of an insect's pupae. Her spindly legs also taper into points; when bloated from feeding, she must run on all eight limbs, which leave small holes in the ground as tracks.

## The Hemoprophet

Already versed in several folk divinations like dowsing and reading patterns in windblown winnowed husks, Shimmerford residents swiftly attributed divinatory powers to the Mosquito Witch.

This "hemoprophet" aspect can supposedly smell conundrums, and she visits those facing difficult decisions or mysteries in their dreams. The witch offers an answer to the dreamer's deepest question, and if the dreamer accepts, the witch drinks their blood as they sleep, tastes their options, and leaves an answer nearby, written with some of the stolen fluids. This Mosquito Witch isn't necessarily malicious, but neither does she worry about draining too much or painting embarrassing blood-truths for all of Shimmerford to see. The blood's weight makes her footfalls heavy, and hunters often remark that especially deep tracks left by anyone are "heavy with answers" in homage to the Witch.
