The Mosquito Witch is a humanoid figure with unpleasant, waxy skin. She always seems to have her head bowed and her shoulders hunched, a mane of unkempt black hair hiding all of her face save for a pair of unblinking red eyes and a long, sharp tongue that's as stiff and pointed as a proboscis. Fleshy, ribbed mosquito wings protrude from her back. She has six handless arms that taper into malformed points, which she keeps clutched to her chest like the legs of an insect's pupae. Her spindly legs also taper into points; when bloated from feeding, she must run on all eight limbs, which leave small holes in the ground as tracks.
