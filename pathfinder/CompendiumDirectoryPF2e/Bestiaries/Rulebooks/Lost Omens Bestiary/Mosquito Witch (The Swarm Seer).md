The Mosquito Witch is a humanoid figure with unpleasant, waxy skin. She always seems to have her head bowed and her shoulders hunched, a mane of unkempt black hair hiding all of her face save for a pair of unblinking red eyes and a long, sharp tongue that's as stiff and pointed as a proboscis. Fleshy, ribbed mosquito wings protrude from her back. She has six handless arms that taper into malformed points, which she keeps clutched to her chest like the legs of an insect's pupae. Her spindly legs also taper into points; when bloated from feeding, she must run on all eight limbs, which leave small holes in the ground as tracks.

## The Swarm Seer

Few have seen the Mosquito Witch, yet almost everyone has suffered her namesake vermin at some point in time. Shimmerford summer skies shimmer with flies hatching from the river and myriad creeks, and "wherever pests fly, the Witch can spy." In her Swarm Seer aspect, the Mosquito Witch is a haunting predator and verminous voyeur whose sanguineous appetites are equal to her fascination with societies. She keeps tabs on every inhabitant with parasocial glee, obsessing over their superstitions and abandoned trinkets-especially any representations of herself.

This Mosquito Witch rarely acts with outright malice or to bring direct harm to those around her. However, her haunting appearance, alien values, and tendency to express emotions with sky-blotting swarms inspires terror in her neighbors. Depending on the circumstances she might represent a fearsome and ineffable ally, a demigod of fecundity, or a terrible foe who long ago lost patience with humanity.
