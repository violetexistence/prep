    desc: "`pf2:1` (manipulate) **Frequency** once per round\n\n**Requirements** The lamp blighter's last action was a successful claw Strike against a creature with eyes\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The lamp blighter attempts to pluck out one of the required creature's eyes. The target must attempt a `DC 21 Fortitude check` save. On a failure, the target takes 4 persistent bleed damage and is [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] for 1 round. On a critical failure, the target's eye is also severely damaged, taking a â€“4 circumstance penalty on all sight-based Perception checks until the target returns to full Hit Points or the wound is otherwise healed (by magic such as [[Spells/Sound Body|Sound Body]] or [[Spells/Regenerate|Regenerate]]). If all a creature's eyes are severely damaged in this way, that creature is [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] for the same duration.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Eye Pluck|Effect: Eye Pluck]]"

  - name: "Fear the Darkness"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (concentrate,emotion,fear,mental,primal) **Requirements** The lamp blighter must be in an area of darkness\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The lamp blighter evokes the terror of being unable to see in the dark. Each creature within a 20-foot emanation that doesn't have darkvision must succeed at a `DC 23 Will check` save or become [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]]."

  - name: "Snuff the Light"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,fire,primal) The lamp blighter extinguishes light sources in a 10-foot emanation. They extinguish all non-magical light sources automatically and attempt to extinguish magical light sources with a +16 counteract modifier and a counteract rank of 3. If the lamp blighter successfully extinguishes any light, their next successful claw or shortbow Strike deals 1d6 persistent fire damage."
