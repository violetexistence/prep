Not all handcrafts are intended for war. The inkdrop is an infiltrator used by spellcasters to learn secrets or alter documents. Embodied in a single fist-sized drop of ink, the inkdrop can glide across a page, changing characters or removing them altogether, with devastating consequences for statecraft.
