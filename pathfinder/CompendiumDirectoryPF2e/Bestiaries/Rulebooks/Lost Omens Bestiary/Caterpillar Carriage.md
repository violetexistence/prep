    desc: "  Tremorsense allows a monster to feel the vibrations through a solid surface caused by movement. It is an imprecise sense with a limited range (listed in the ability). Tremorsense functions only if the monster is on the same surface as the subject, and only if the subject is moving along (or burrowing through) the surface."

Some forms of magical darkness, such as a 4th-rank [[Spells/Darkness|Darkness]] spell, block normal darkvision. A monster with [[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Greater Darkvision|Greater Darkvision]], however, can see through even these forms of magical darkness."

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead spend an action to use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

The constructs of the Clicking Caverns all have similar designs, being made of clockwork. The most unusual feature of them is that they're self-replicating, or perhaps self-reincarnating, since the animation of a haunted construct requires a soul.

* * *

The haunted construct known as the caterpillar carriage is composed of armored segments that flow over one another as the carriage inches forward. It has two forelegs that dig grooves into the ground, making way for the many wheels situated along its underside.
