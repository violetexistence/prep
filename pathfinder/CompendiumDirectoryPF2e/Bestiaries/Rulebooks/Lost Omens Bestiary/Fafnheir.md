  - name: "Curse of the Woeful Wyrd"
    desc: " (curse,primal) When a creature slays Fafnheir, it becomes home to his soul, which slowly emerges from his killer's body. The creature must attempt a `DC 52 Will check` save or become [[Conditions/Doomed|Doomed 2]] ([[Conditions/Doomed|Doomed 1]] on a success, unaffected on a critical success). Unless the creature critically succeeded at the saving throw, each day the doomed value increases by 1. If the creature dies while suffering the curse of the woeful wyrd, its corpse explodes in a 60-foot burst with the effect of Blasting Breath. Fafnheir is immediately returned to life in the nearest available space to the corpse with full Hit Points and no conditions. Even an indirect slaying usually still allows Fafnheir to curse the soul of his slayer through the metaphysical link between them."

Creatures in the area must also attempt a `DC 48 Fortitude check` save to resist the powerful winds and deafening thunderclaps of the breath. Creatures that fail experience the effects of [[Spells/Gust of Wind|Gust of Wind]], affecting Large or smaller creatures as normal.

Fafnheir is the fabled Father of Linnorms. He's larger than all other linnorms on Golarion, with a length of 60 feet and a weight upwards of 10 tons. Fafnheir is a clever and powerful creature, worthy of the fear of all people in the Lands of the Linnorm Kings.
