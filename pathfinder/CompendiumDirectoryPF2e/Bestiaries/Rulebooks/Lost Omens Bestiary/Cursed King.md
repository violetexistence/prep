Afflicted creatures must attempt the saving throw again every 24 hours, increasing the stupefied condition by 1 on a failure or 2 on a critical failure.

A cursed king is a grotesque mockery of ambition. When treasonous advisors, false prophets, and rebel leaders are captured by evil rulers, they're subjected to all manner of torture and humiliation before their eventual executions. But the cursed king isn't even granted dignity in death, as after their beheading, a desiccated animal head is sewn onto their neck. These horrific mummies are then dressed in fine linens and jewelry befitting royaltyâ€”a permanent warning of what happens to those who seek to rise above their station.

A cursed king is bound in servitude to the ruler against whom they once fought, forced to act as a bodyguard. Even the death of their maker gives no reprieve, as they guard the true monarch's tomb forever.
