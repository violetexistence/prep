Though it superficially resembles a cypress tree and is easily mistaken for an arboreal or other similar plant creature, Temteki is actually an earth elemental, a creature of living earth and stone. In normal situations, Temteki is content to remain still and blend into the jungle when observing other creatures, using its natural camouflage to assist in harrying those it considers interlopers disturbing its home. Temteki usually dissuades such intruders with a combination of surprise attacks and nonlethal snares; the elemental is more interested in getting them to leave than in dealing them any permanent harm. However, to those who prove determined to harm Temteki or its home, Temteki can be an implacable foe. Temteki's asymmetrical gait and appearance often alarm and confuse creatures who aren't expecting to spot it, especially since it's surprisingly stealthy for its size and appearance.
