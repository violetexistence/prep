    desc: "  Scent involves sensing creatures or objects by smell, and is usually a vague sense. The range is listed in the ability, and it functions only if the creature or object being detected emits an aroma (for instance, incorporeal creatures usually do not exude an aroma).\n\nIf a creature emits a heavy aroma or is upwind, the GM can double or even triple the range of scent abilities used to detect that creature, and the GM can reduce the range if a creature is downwind."

Some forms of magical darkness, such as a 4th-rank [[Spells/Darkness|Darkness]] spell, block normal darkvision. A monster with [[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Greater Darkvision|Greater Darkvision]], however, can see through even these forms of magical darkness."

    desc: "`pf2:3` (divine) The aso berang dashes to attack each nearby enemy so quickly that it's impossible to tell they've moved at all, save for a slight flicker in their outline. The aso berang Strides adjacent to an enemy and attempts a melee Strike. If successful, the aso berang can Stride and attempt to Strike a different enemy. If this second attack is successful, they can Stride and attempt to Strike a third enemy. Once they fail a Strike (or upon succeeding at their third Strike), the aso berang Strides back to the space where they began."

Deep within the woods are grand, giant creatures with tusked maws. Their visages have inspired various tusked demon masks used for great festivals across Tian Xia. These beasts are known as aso berangs, or bear dogs, in the islands of Minata. As their name suggests, they resemble large canines with the bulk of a bear. However, aso berangs aren't simply large and charismatic animals, for many say they're the kings of forest spirits and patrons of guardians. They're often revered as protective entities by those who live outside the woods they guard. These guardians only appear to common folk if the forest they live in is in danger or if they need something. When they do so, aso berangs can appear as large and powerful humans who emanate a regal presence. Aso berangs have wickedly sharp talons that shed regularly, and they're strong enough to climb trees in pursuit of witches who attempt to escape up them. Very often, aso berangs attack visitors whose hearts they deem impure or those they consider as potential threats to their forest. Unfortunately, receiving this judgment usually takes little more than forgetting to perform the proper rites of respect and reverence.
