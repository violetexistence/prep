    desc: "`pf2:r`  **Trigger** A creature within the monster's reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The monster attempts a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, the monster disrupts that action. This Strike doesn't count toward the monster's multiple attack penalty, and its multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike."

  - name: "Reconstitution"
    desc: "  Until Geb's curse is broken, any stone sister who's destroyed gradually reforms in her original shape. A stone sister who's reduced to 0 Hit Points will reform after 24 hours, while one reduced to rubble or dust might take a year or more to reform. Stone sisters who are removed from the Field of Maidens always attempt to return to it when they reconstitute."

  - name: "Stone Flesh"
    desc: "  A stone sister is made of a bizarre stone that never stops bleeding from numerous cracks along her skin. She reacts to certain spells in unique ways, as listed below.\n\n*   Spells that alter earth, such as shape stone, either deal 3d10 points of damage or heal 3d10 healing Hit Points, as decided by the caster. If the spell is specifically harmful or beneficial to earth and stone, the GM might decide it can only harm the stone sister, or only heal her.\n*   Stone to flesh doesn't revert a stone sister to flesh and blood but instead weakens her. She loses her resistance to physical damage for 1 minute. If she's reduced to 0 Hit Points during this time, she's permanently destroyed and can't reform."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Void Healing|Void Healing]]"
    desc: "  A creature with void healing draws health from void energy rather than vitality energy. It is damaged by vitality damage and is not healed by vitality healing effects. It does not take void damage, and it is healed by void effects that heal undead."

    desc: " (curse) The creature must succeed at a `DC 21 Fortitude check` save or become [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 2]] ([[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 3]] on a critical failure) and gain a +1 status bonus to AC as their skin hardens to stone. The clumsy condition can be temporarily relieved for 24 hours by casting stone to flesh on the cursed creature but can't be removed or reduced by any other means short of removing the curse; during this time, the cursed creature also no longer receives the status bonus to AC.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Curse of Stone|Effect: Curse of Stone]]"

  - name: "Statue"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate) Until the next time she acts, the stone sister appears to be a statue. She has an automatic result of 34 on Deception checks and DCs to pass as a statue. Since the Field of Maidens is filled with thousands of statues just like her, most of which aren't stone sisters, it's incredibly difficult to recognize her true nature."
