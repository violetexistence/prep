    desc: " The only way to launch a Hillcross glider is to jump off a steep incline with favorable wind conditions. The glider is uncontrolled and falls 60 feet each round until the pilot successfully [[Actions/Take Control|Takes Control]]. If the glider hits the ground before the pilot Takes Control, the pilot and the glider both take falling damage."
