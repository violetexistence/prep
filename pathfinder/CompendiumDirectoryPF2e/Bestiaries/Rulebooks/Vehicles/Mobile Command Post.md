    desc: "This utilitarian vehicle resembles a small encampment, complete with protective barriers, a kitchen, sleeping quarters, and partitioned offices, all mounted on ironclad timbers. Beneath these timbers is a series of cogs and wheels, enclosed by a solid chain track made of iron plates. These tracks enable the mobile command post to move over all types of terrain, albeit at a slow pace. Once in position, these tracks fold up, allowing the vehicle's base to rest on the ground while providing extra protection along the sides of the vehicle.\n* * *"
