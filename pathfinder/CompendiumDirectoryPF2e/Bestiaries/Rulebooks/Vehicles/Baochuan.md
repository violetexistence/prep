    desc: "The keel of these vessels consists of wooden beams bound together with iron hoops to provide added stability during ocean transits. In stormy weather, holes in the prow partially fill with water when the ship pitches forward, lessening the violent turbulence caused by waves. Renowned for their seaworthiness, Baochuan were often chosen for transporting valuable treasure or important emissaries during stormy seasons. As such, they're often referred to as \"treasure ships\" and highly sought prizes by pirates.\n* * *"
