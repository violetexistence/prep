Using a pair of clockwork mechanisms, the main hulls can be lifted out of the water, with only the narrow blade of their keels remaining slightly below the surface, turning the skimmer into an even faster hydrofoil, doubling its normal speed.\n* * *"

    desc: "`pf2:2` (manipulate) The skimmer's hydrofoils are deployed by pulling a lever, doubling the vehicle's normal Speed. However, this makes the vehicle less maneuverable, and it must move twice its length for each 90-degree turn it makes while the hydrofoils are deployed. The pilot can take this action again to retract the hydrofoils and return the skimmer to its normal Speed and maneuverability."
