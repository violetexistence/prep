    desc: "While the name slightly overstates its size, nonetheless a magical clockwork castle is a sizable mobile fortress built on ten spiderlike clockwork legs, with three stories of palatial accommodations within. Legends tell of a unique clockwork castle massively larger even than this size, perhaps an artifact in its own right.\n* * *"

  - name: "Maneuverable"
    desc: " This vehicle is mounted on ten spider-like legs that enable it to turn swiftly, turn in place, and even move backward. Each 90-degree turn made in less than a vehicle length costs 5 extra feet of movement; so, for example, it costs 10 feet of movement for the vehicle to turn around and begin moving backward.

    desc: " This vehicle has four rooftop weapon mounts; one mount on each corner of the vehicle. At purchase, these weapon mounts are initially empty. Installing or uninstalling a weapon into a weapon mount requires 10 minutes, a successful `DC 35 Crafting check`, and an appropriate weapon. Three of these weapon mounts can be equipped with ranged weapons, and the fourth can be equipped with a ranged siege weapon of size Large or smaller."
