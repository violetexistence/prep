An oval fabric envelope stretched over a wood‑and‑metal frame contains a dozen sealed gasbags of floranine gas that provide lift to get the vessel airborne. A pair of clockwork‑powered propellers mounted in nacelles on either side of the crew cabin provides forward motion. Crew steer the ship with rudders and ailerons in four massive tail fins.\n* * *"
