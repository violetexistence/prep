    desc: "`pf2:3` The pilot engages a lever that activates the clockwork components to transform the adaptable paddleboat's waterwheels into wheels for rolling along the ground. This grants the adaptable paddleboat Speed 20 feet and reduces its swim Speed to 5 feet. This transformation lasts until the pilot disengages the wheels by using this activity again."
