    desc: " The shark diver can travel beneath the surface of the water, carrying an air reservoir suitable to sustain 11 Medium creatures for up to 24 hours. The shark diver can safely reach depths of up to 300 feet. If broken, the shark diver loses air from its reservoir, reducing the stored air by 10 minutes per round. A broken shark diver has its maximum depth reduced by half."
