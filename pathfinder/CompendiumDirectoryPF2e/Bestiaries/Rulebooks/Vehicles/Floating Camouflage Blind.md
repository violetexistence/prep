    desc: "The floating camouflage blind comprises a wooden platform fastened to a pair of pontoons and is powered by a small clockwork motor. On this platform are four short walls, with a canvas cover providing protection from the elements. Typically, the outside of the blind is painted to blend in with any surrounding foliage. Floating camouflage blinds are often placed near the mouth of strategic waterways so that traffic can be stealthily monitored.\n* * *"

    desc: " 10 minutes of wind-up, 1 hour of operational time, [[Actions/disable-device dc=19|disable-device dc=19]]{DC 19}, standby\n* * *\n\nFor a clockwork to act, it must be wound with a unique key by another creature. This takes 1 minute. Once wound, it remains operational for the listed amount of time, usually 24 hours, after which time it becomes unaware of its surroundings and can't act until it's wound again. Some clockworks' abilities require them to spend some of their remaining operational time. They can't spend more than they have and shut down immediately once they have 0 time remaining. If it's unclear when a clockwork was last wound, most clockwork keepers wind all their clockworks at a set time, typically 8 a.m.\n\nA clockwork that lists standby in its wind-up entry can enter standby mode as a 3-action activity. Its operational time doesn't decrease in standby, but it can sense its surroundings (with a -2 penalty to Perception). It can't act, with one exception: when it perceives a creature, it can exit standby as a reaction (rolling initiative if appropriate).\n\nA creature can attempt to Disable a Device to wind a clockwork down (with a DC listed in the wind-up entry). For each success, the clockwork loses 1 hour of operational time. This can be done even if the clockwork is in standby mode."
