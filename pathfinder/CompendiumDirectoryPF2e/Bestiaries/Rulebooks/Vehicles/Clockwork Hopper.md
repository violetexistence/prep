    desc: " This vehicle hops across the terrain as it moves across the ground. The clockwork hopper ignores difficult terrain from earth, rock, rubble, slopes, and underbrush, and greater difficult terrain caused by those features is normal difficult terrain to the clockwork hopper."

  - name: "Massive Jump"
    desc: "`pf2:3` (move, reckless) The pilot engages a spring-driven mechanism that rockets the clockwork hopper into the air, in a grand leap. The vehicle jumps in a straight line in the direction of its current heading without touching the ground, landing in a space of solid ground up to 70 feet forward and up to 30 feet up. Creatures adjacent to the spaces a hopper lands in take 4d10 bludgeoning damage with a `DC 22 Reflex check`, and are knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] on a critical failure. The clockwork hopper can't use Massive Jump again for 1 minute. Massive Jump stops working if the clockwork hopper is [[Conditions/Broken|Broken]]."
