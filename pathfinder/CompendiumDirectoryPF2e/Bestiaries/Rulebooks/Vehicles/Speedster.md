    desc: "A speedster is a light streamlined hybrid clockwork and steam-powered alchemical chassis roughly the shape of a horse or other creature built for speed. Speedsters are built to maintain a rapid pace that can become even faster for brief periods of time by releasing stored up steam pressure for an extra burst of speed.\n* * *"

    desc: "`pf2:1` The pilot releases built up pressure in the speedster's alchemical steam engine in order to temporarily increase its speed. For 1d4 rounds, the speedster's Speed becomes 80 feet and all move actions the pilot takes gain the reckless trait. When the pilot takes an action that already would have the reckless trait, the pilot uses the degree of success one worse than the one they rolled on the piloting check. The speedster can't use Speed Boost again for 1 hour, as the pressure requires time to rebuild."
