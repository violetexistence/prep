    desc: "The structure of these gargantuan vessels is fully covered by iron. These vessels are akin to floating fortresses rather than true warships, and are typically used in coastal actions and for river blockades. They use oars for propulsion, as their full iron cladding, as well as their bulk, impedes propulsion via sails.\n\nMany of these vessels are beautifully gilded with red and gold inlays across their iron cladding. This added weight only further contributes to their suspect stability.\n* * *"
