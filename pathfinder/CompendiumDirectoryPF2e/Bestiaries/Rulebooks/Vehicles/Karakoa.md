    desc: "Karakoa are large twin-hulled outriggers used by the Tian-Sing for transit within the massive Minata archipelago. Fast and sturdy, karakoa are distinct from other Tian vessels in that they're equipped with platforms for transporting warriors and fighting at sea. During peacetime, they're also used as trading ships, able to carry goods and passengers. While capable of crossing oceans, their open hull design may perform poorly during rough seas as breaking whitecaps could swamp the craft.\n* * *"
