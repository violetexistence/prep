    desc: "This clockwork vehicle consists of a small wheeled platform under a pair of wings made with a light wooden frame covered by sturdy cloth. An air cycle must be launched from a high altitude, similar to a glider. Once airborne, however, the air cycle can be kept aloft and controlled using a system of pedals and steering handles to control its speed and direction. If you stop pedaling the air cycle, it functions as a glider.\n* * *"
