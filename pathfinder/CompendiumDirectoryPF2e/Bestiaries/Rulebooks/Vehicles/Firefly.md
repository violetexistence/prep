    desc: "A firefly blends magic and technology, using electricity magic and magnetism to hover just above the ground. While a firefly is more box-like than insect-shaped, it gets its name from the constant glow of the light and electricity magic that power it, as well as from the stabilizing magnets that protrude from its sides in roughly the same position as wings would be.\n* * *"

All creatures in the bright light from its glow aura must succeed at a `DC 19 Fortitude check` or be [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] for 1 minute. The firefly's light dims for 10 minutes, reducing its glow to 10 feet of dim light, during which time it can't use flash. Flash stops working if the firefly is broken."
