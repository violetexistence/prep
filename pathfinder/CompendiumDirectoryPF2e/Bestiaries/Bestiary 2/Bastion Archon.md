The mightiest of archon-kind form in the heat of battle from incredibly uncommon circumstances. When a gathering of lantern archons converges into a gestalt in order to defend allies in a fight that seems all but lost, a fellow archon of significant strength-such as a star archon-can commit a brave act of self-sacrifice by dimensionally transposing itself with the gestalt. If the circumstances are just right and luck is with the archons, the result is not a glorious sacrifice, but instead the earth-rocking emergence of a bastion archon. In this way, the lowliest of archons-the lanterns-can, in an instant, become their kind's greatest hope.

Bastion archons are massive beings made of the very stone of Heaven's Holy Mountain, with their visages obscured by a blinding light surrounding the gestalt that originally formed the bastion. Tireless in their embodiment of the virtue of sacrifice, a bastion archon almost always protects the area where they manifested, and even when they are destroyed they leave an indelible mark of righteousness upon the surrounding region.
