Taiga linnorms are covered in hundreds of quill-like black spines as sharp as spears. Wise hunters native to linnorm-infested lands know to watch for spines stuck in the bark of conifers-a sure sign that a taiga linnorm has recently passed through. Sometimes this means of tracking isn't enough to avoid an encounter, however; taiga linnorms, like their tarn and tor brethren, are skilled stalkers. They prefer to lurk in half-frozen bogs or swampy marshlands with their heads poking just above the water's surface, ever watchful for unwary prey.
