Freezing and thawing in a near-constant loop, blizzardborn resemble humanoid forms composed of a mixture of partially melted snow and sleet. These elementals move with crunching strides, their bodies constantly sloshing and sloughing off shards of ice. Because of their ability to refreeze, blizzardborn can travel into warmer environments safely, though they tend to look more like slush in these areas.
