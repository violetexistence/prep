    desc: "`pf2:2`  **Requirements** The belker occupies the same space as a Medium or smaller creature\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The belker attempts to flow into the creature's lungs; the creature must attempt a `DC 23 Fortitude check` save. On a failure, the creature partially inhales the belker and is [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] by the pain of the smoke rasping in its throat and lungs. The creature can attempt to exhale the belker by spending an action coughing and succeeding at a `DC 23 Fortitude check` save. Most of the belker remains outside the creature, so the belker can still act normally. If the belker moves out of the creature's space or uses Noxious Fumes again, the creature automatically exhales it."

These reclusive elementals have glowing red eyes, leathery wings, and long, sharp claws. While they always retain their shape, belkers can control the solidity of their forms at will, transforming into clouds of smoke, ash, and dust.
