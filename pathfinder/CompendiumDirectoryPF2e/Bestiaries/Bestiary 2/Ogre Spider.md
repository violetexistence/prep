These terrifying creatures grow as large as elephants. The placement of their eyes above their wide mandibles evokes the grimacing visage of an ogre's leer. Ogres themselves find the appearance of ogre spider faces simultaneously amusing and adorable, but in most cases, ogres' attempts to keep these spiders as pets result in dead ogres and well-fed spiders.
