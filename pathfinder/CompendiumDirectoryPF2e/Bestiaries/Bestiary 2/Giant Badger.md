The violent, territorial giant badger is a relentless predator. An obligate carnivore, its prey ranges from rabbits to deer, livestock, and even the occasional traveler or adventurer. A giant badger's claws are sharp and strong enough to carve tunnels from solid rock. They typically stand 4 feet tall at the shoulder and weigh 500 pounds.

* * *

The burrowing badger is plentiful in most temperate forests. All badgers are naturally fierce and tenacious, and their squat stature belies their strength and speed.
