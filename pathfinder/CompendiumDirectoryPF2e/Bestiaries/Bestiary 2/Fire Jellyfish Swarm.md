While individually one of these fist-sized jellyfish is merely a nuisance, in great numbers, fire jellyfish can form into dangerous swarms. Bobbing in the water, they create a cloud of stinging tentacles. They were named in part for their bright coloration, but those who are stung by fire jellyfish learn the larger reason for their name-the pain of their stings is comparable to being burned alive.
