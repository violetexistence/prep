    desc: " (curse,primal) A culdewen that captures a creature is compelled to immediately retreat to a secluded place to eat, typically journeying by boat. The travel to the secluded place always takes at least 1 day. Their captive is cursed to vanish on the journey-typically being lost in the water or consumed by aquatic creatures-and can be recovered only by a [[Spells/Wish|Wish]] spell or similarly powerful magic."

  - name: "Land the Fish"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** A creature is hooked by the culdewen's fish hook and adjacent to the culdewen\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The culdewen hoists the creature over their shoulder, as though it weighs no more than a fish. Unless the creature is unable to act, the culdewen must attempt an `Athletics check` check against the creature's Fortitude DC. On a success, the creature is [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]] by the culdewen. [[Actions/Escape|Escaping]] from the restrained condition (DC 25) also allows a creature to remove the hook.\n\nWhile hoisting a creature, the culdewen gains a +20-foot status bonus to their Speeds and is compelled to escape with it (see culdewen's curse above)."

  - name: "Reel In"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (manipulate) The culdewen pulls the rope attached to their hook. If they have no creature hooked, the fish hook returns to the culdewen's hand. If a creature is hooked, the culdewen attempts an `Athletics check` check against the creature's Fortitude DC, pulling it up to 30 feet closer on a success (60 feet on a critical success)."

  - name: "Swear"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (auditory,curse,primal) The culdewen unleashes a string of invectives. Each creature that hears them must attempt a `DC 25 Will check` save, with the effects of [[Spells/Mariner's Curse|Mariner's Curse]] and is then temporarily immune for 24 hours. Even on a failed save, the curse ends automatically after 1 day."

Perpetually cursed to hunger and failure, a culdewen plies waterways in search of appealing fish to catch-the bigger the better. Of course, this diminutive, emaciated fey calls every living creature a "fish." Only other fey are exempt, and they tend to consider culdewens lost causes. A culdewen can never find satisfaction. Each time they catch a fish, a magical curse forces them to hunt for an appealing spot to dine-an island, cove, or abandoned dock or shack where they can eat in peace. By the time they arrive, their catch will be gone. Every time. Forever.

A foul mood hovers over a culdewen, causing them to swear colorfully, smack things with their oar, and shake their tiny fists at the sky. Conversation with a culdewen is fruitless, as they talk in circles, speaking only of fishing and the weather. Capturing a "fish" gives a culdewen a rare moment of happiness; the culdewen capers and ululates, pleased with their catch, and rushes off to their boat.
