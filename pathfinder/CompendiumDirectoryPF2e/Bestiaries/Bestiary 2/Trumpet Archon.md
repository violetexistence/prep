Trumpet archons are messengers, emissaries, and storytellers-embodiments of the virtue of kindness. They use stories and allegories to prevent bloodshed, and among all archons they are the most likely to work together with angels, perhaps leading to the similarities in their forms. When diplomacy is impossible, trumpet archons rally the righteous to battle-one reassuring glance from a trumpet archon is often all it takes to instill a shaken ally with resounding courage once again.
