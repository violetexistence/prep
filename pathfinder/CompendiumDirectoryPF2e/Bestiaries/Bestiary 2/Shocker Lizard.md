    desc: "`pf2:2` (electricity) The shocker lizard releases a blast of lightning from its body. Creatures within a 10-foot emanation take 3d6 electricity damage (`DC 18 Reflex check` save).\n\nThe shocker lizard can't use Discharge for 1d4 rounds."

  - name: "Shocking Burst"
    desc: "`pf2:3` (electricity,primal) The shocker lizard hunkers down and begins to spark with electricity, which it releases in a 10-foot emanation that deals 3d8 electricity damage (`DC 18 Reflex check` save).\n\nThe shocker lizard can't use Shocking Burst again for 1 minute.\n\nUp to four shocker lizards can combine their Shocking Bursts. In this case, the lizards can delay the release of their electricity until any other shocker lizard within 30 feet completes its Shocking Burst. The combined Shocking Bursts create an emanation with the combined area from all participating shocker lizards. For each additional shocker lizard that joins the burst, the damage increases by 3d8 and the save DC increases by 1 (to a maximum of four lizards dealing 12d8 damage with a DC 21 save)."

These brightly colored reptiles share the rough size and pack mentality of guard dogs, roaming in small groups. Shocker lizards have specialized glands under their scales that accumulate static electricity, and they can unleash blasts of lightning strong enough to harm significantly larger foes. Though they're meek and docile when encountered alone, shocker lizards are significantly more aggressive in packs, when they can amplify each other's electrical attacks.

Shocker lizards are notoriously difficult to domesticate because they're dangerously hostile as part of a pack, but will also swiftly wither and die if kept alone in captivity without constant attention. A shocker lizard is 3 feet long and weighs 25 pounds.
