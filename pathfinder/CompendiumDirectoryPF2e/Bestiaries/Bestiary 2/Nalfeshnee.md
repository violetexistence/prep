Any non-demon is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]] and [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] as long as it holds, wears, or touches a glowing item.\n\nRecovering from the sickness requires a successful `DC 29 Will check` save instead of a Fortitude save. Ending the sickness this way ends the slowed condition and makes the creature temporarily immune to Light of Avarice for 24 hours.\n\nIf the creature removes or drops the item, both conditions end immediately but the creature doesn't become immune to Light of Avarice."

Nalfeshnees are huge, corpulent, boar-headed demons that hoard treasures and knowledge alike and form from the souls of avaricious mortals. Few demons understand the inner workings of the Abyss itself like nalfeshnees, and it's not unusual for a nalfeshnee to see itself as a servitor of the Abyss itself first rather than bow before a demon lord. Some claim stewardship over the fleshy realms that birth new demons, while others guard sites of particular significance deep in the plane's secret reaches. A nalfeshnee's realm in the Abyss can easily surpass the strength and size of the largest mortal kingdoms, for nalfeshnees display a singular gift for managing and manipulating the chaos of the Abyss.
