While the leaders of larger spriggan enclaves tend to be uniquely trained warriors with highly specialized skills, spriggan warlords are fond of the traditional spriggan weaponry of morningstar and crossbow, valuing this traditional fighting style for its simplicity and for using both weapons to their full potential. Spriggan warlords often serve as sub-commanders in large groups, filling roles in spriggan society akin to captains of the guard or bodyguards to spriggan royalty. In smaller groups or remote outposts, a single spriggan warlord is typically in charge of a band of spriggan bullies.
