Lerritans are unstoppable giants with skin of volcanic glass and blood of roiling lava. These malicious arsonists would see the world burned to a cinder. They pay homage to Ymeri, the evil elemental demigod of fire, and they bully other fiery creatures. When the urge to immolate grows too great to ignore, lerritans burn forests, destroy villages, and boil rivers, but they avoid large bodies of water.
