The Enfeebled value increases by 1 at the start of each of the doprillu's turns, to a maximum of Enfeebled 4. If the mask is put back on, the doprillu immediately regains its abilities and loses the Enfeebled condition.\n\nA creature can pull off the mask with a successful Athletics check to [[Actions/Force Open|Force Open]]."

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead spend an action to use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

The aberrations known as doprillus are hulks with banded muscles who wear ornate masks at all times that fill their wearers with magical strength and fighting spirit. Doprillus love to battle, especially by grappling, and are eager to start brawls. On neutral ground, a doprillu offers to duel the strongest-looking opponent, but when a doprillu's home turf is invaded, no rules apply to the confrontation. As befits the superheated blood that fuels them, doprillus make their homes in warm locations: hot jungles, sunny deserts, and underground caverns near sulfur vents.
