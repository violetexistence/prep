A creature that fails is also [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] (or [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]] on a critical failure)."

These creatures look like roiling clouds of black smoke churning above a mound of burning refuse. Leering faces form and fade in the smoke above, while the burning trash writhes in spasmodic lurches, obviously alive.
