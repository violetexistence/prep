Tremorsense functions only if the monster is on the same surface as the subject, and only if the subject is moving along (or burrowing through) the surface."

    desc: "`pf2:2` (arcane,concentrate,incapacitation,visual) The dracolisk stares at a creature it can see within 30 feet. That creature must attempt a `DC 28 Fortitude check` save. If it fails and has not already been slowed by Petrifying Glance or this ability, it becomes [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]]. If the creature already was slowed by this ability or Petrifying Glance, a failed save causes the creature to be [[Conditions/Petrified|Petrified]] permanently.\n\nA creature petrified in this manner can be instantly restored to flesh by being coated (not just splashed) with fresh dracolisk or basilisk blood no more than 1 hour old. A single dracolisk contains enough blood to coat 1d4+2 Medium creatures in this manner."

  - name: "Savage Jaws"
    desc: "`pf2:2`  The dracolisk makes a single Strike with its jaws. If the attack hits, it deals 4d12+16 piercing damage (versatile S). This counts as two attacks for its multiple attack penalty."

Dracolisks are rare magical crossbreeds of chromatic dragons and basilisks. None now know how they first came to be, but they have proven viable and can breed with one another as well as with basilisks. While a dracolisk appears much like a young true dragon of its parent type, its eight legs are an immediate indication that it is something more. Its coloration varies, depending on the nature of its draconic ancestry, though it's lighter on its underside and darker near its wing tips. A typical dracolisk is 15 feet long and weighs 3,000 pounds.
