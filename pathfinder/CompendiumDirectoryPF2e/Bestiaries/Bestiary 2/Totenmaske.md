This is either its form from before it became undead, or the form of the last creature it successfully hit with Drink Flesh.\n\nThis doesn't change the totenmaske's Speed or the attack and damage bonuses for its Strikes, but might change the damage type its Strikes deal (typically to bludgeoning)."

  - name: "Shape Flesh"
    desc: " (curse,divine) After spending 1 minute in contact with a [[Conditions/Paralyzed|Paralyzed]], [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]], or willing creature, a totenmaske can reshape the target's face, causing flesh to cover vital features.\n\nThe target can attempt a `DC 25 Fortitude check` save to resist; a critical success grants temporary immunity to Shape Flesh for 24 hours.\n\nEach time the totenmaske Shapes Flesh, it chooses one feature: ears (target becomes [[Conditions/Deafened|Deafened]]), eyes (target becomes [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]]), mouth (target can't speak or eat), or nose (target can't smell). A creature with both its nose and mouth sealed can't breathe and begins to suffocate.\n\nChanges are permanent until reversed by removing this curse, or the sealed flesh can be surgically opened with a `DC 25 Medicine check` check that takes 1d4 rounds and deals 1d6 slashing damage per round."

Spawned by the same unnatural and self-destructive obsessions that drove them when they were alive, totenmaskes are the undead remnants of the most self-indulgent and sinful among us. Though unable to sate their perverse desires, these foul undead can drain the very flesh from their victims so as to wrap themselves in a perverse mockery of life that allows them to pursue their base wants. Totenmaskes' specific longings vary-one might be obsessed with food or drink, while another might be vain and desirous of an attractive form to marvel at in a mirror, while yet another could simply long for the scent of blood. Whatever the sensation the totenmaske seeks, it is always a vice taken to extreme, for this sin is what helped condemn it to unlife in the first place. A totenmaske obsessed with food, for example, might find itself assaulting bakeries or breweries, while a vain totenmaske obsessed with glamor could quickly grow bored of each new look and switch its victims out daily, or even hourly.
