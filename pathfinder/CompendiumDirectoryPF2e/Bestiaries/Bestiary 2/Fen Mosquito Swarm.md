When deadly fen mosquitoes gather in large numbers, they form into lethal swarms capable of draining blood at a truly alarming rate. Fen mosquito swarms are typically encountered only in tropical swamps or bogs, but during humid months in spring or summer they can drift into riverine areas or even through the waterfront reaches of settlements.
