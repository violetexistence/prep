The chernobue infects all creatures it encounters with itself, spreading pain and calamity wherever it flops and writhes. It sheds ruin and sups on anguish, but a chernobue can sometimes be persuaded to pause for a few moments of conversation if its partner in discourse can keep its attention by providing enough atrocious details. Resembling a tumor-like growth of oily blackness, this vile monstrosity has numerous muscular tentacles, a single glaring baleful eye, and a drooling, toothy maw in the middle of its body.
