Resembling wingless, serpentine dragons formed of jagged ice and shot through with veins of nearly frozen water, these elementals dwell within icebergs and enjoy striking out at passing ships or creatures. They're especially common in frigid stretches of ocean in the Plane of Water, where icebergs cluster together into enormous islands of ice.
