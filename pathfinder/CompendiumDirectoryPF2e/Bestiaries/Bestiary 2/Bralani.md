    desc: " (divine,mental) Once per day, a bralani can spend 1 minute to bless willing creatures within 100 feet who are about to participate in a contest. This blessing lasts 24 hours. If a blessed creature cheats or uses the contest to harm another, the creature grows visibly ill, becoming [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] and unable to remove this condition for the duration or until they withdraw from the competition. At the end of the contest, participants who competed fairly find it easier to negotiate and understand their opponent's perspective. For 1 hour, they gain a +2 status bonus to Diplomacy checks and [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] checks that directly pertain to their opponents."

Bralanis embody the freedom of fair competition, embracing opportunities to test their skills against worthy foes and bring mortals together with the thrill of good-natured sports and contests. Their interest in constructive conflict also extends to higher stakes, such as diplomatic negotiations. In these cases, bralanis ensure that neither side's desires are crushed by the other's and work as mediators when needed. They believe in friendly contests to diffuse tension. When discussions are going well, bralanis step back, allowing the participants to shape their own futures. They delight in sailing through violent storms as wind, basking in the raw energy.
