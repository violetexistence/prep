    desc: "`pf2:2` (holy) The planetar makes a greatsword Strike against a target it detects as evil.

This doesn't change their Speed or Strikes.\n* * *\n\nThe monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

The beings of righteous fury known as planetars are known to be the least patient of angels. They exist to destroy evil that cannot be redeemed, and they often leave prolonged dialogue to other angels. Of course, no planetar ignores the importance of diplomacy, but they know that others among the angelic hosts are better suited to that task, while they focus on the larger picture. In angelic armies, planetars serve as commanders or generals. They stand at least 9 feet tall and weigh over 500 pounds.
