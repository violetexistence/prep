    desc: "  Tremorsense allows a monster to feel the vibrations through a solid surface caused by movement. It is an imprecise sense with a limited range (listed in the ability). Tremorsense functions only if the monster is on the same surface as the subject, and only if the subject is moving along (or burrowing through) the surface."

Giant flies lay their eggs on the bodies of larger monsters or livestock. When they hatch, these eggs release squirming maggots the size of human children, ravenous young who voraciously consume any flesh in the immediate vicinity-typically starting with the body upon which they were born.

Giant flies are pony-sized insects that have massive compound eyes and bodies bristling with short, stiff hairs. Their lairs are notorious for the rotting meat they stockpile to lay their eggs into. Their maggot-dens are also prime breeding grounds for virulent diseases.
