    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,polymorph,primal) The onidoshi takes on the appearance of an ogre. This doesn't change their Speed or Strike attack and damage.\n* * *\n\nThe monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

Onidoshi, or ogre mages, are oni with the material form of an ogre. Onidoshi's supernatural prowess and overwhelming intellect are enough to awe and cow entire families of rank-and-file ogres. Because of this, onidoshi are often found at the head of ogre war parties or orchestrating these violent campaigns from behind the scenes. It's rare for onidoshi to lead solitary existences, but those who do prefer to maraud the countryside or exploit villages and hoard the spoils for themselves.
