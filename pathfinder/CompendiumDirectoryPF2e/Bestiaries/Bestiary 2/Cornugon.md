Hell's armies contain legions upon legions of different devils all suited precisely to their roles. But such an army needs able commanders, and it is this role that cornugons fill. Their mere presence inspires those under their command to improved performance- often through fear of the horrible torments that a cornugon can unleash as punishment for failure. Forged in the fires of Malebolge from the most renowned warriors among lesser devilkind, even the least cornugon is among the fiercest warriors of the multiverse. The greatest among them on occasion ascend further still, becoming those rare and feared legends of Hell called malebranche.

Each type of devil plays a particular role in Hell's bureaucracies and hierarchies, though some have far more specialized functions than others.
