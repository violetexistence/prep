The bythos is a guardian of space and time, and at all times seeks out those who misuse planar and temporal magic. A bythos is a roughly humanoid creature with four arms and a body made of swirling clouds and mist. Despite its appearance, its body feels like dry stone. A bythos seeks out paradoxes caused by irresponsible planar or dimensional travelers and repairs breaches where the barriers between planes have become thin or damaged. If the mortals responsible remain in the area and cannot be convinced to cease their activities, the bythos has no qualms about removing them. Using its ability to manipulate time, a bythos might cause an opponent to quickly die of old age as time speeds up around them, or cause a target to disappear from time and space.
