    desc: "  When a theletos conveys information, it does so wordlessly through psychic projections. This acts as [[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Telepathy|Telepathy]] with a range of 100 feet but is understandable to all creatures regardless of whether they have a language. The meaning to non-aeons can be vague and is often mysterious. A theletos can use this ability to communicate flawlessly with any other aeon on the same plane."

Theletoses maintain the balance between fate and free will. A theletos is a roughly spherical mass of crystals from which emerge four limbs, each split at the elbow and ending in three-fingered hands. A pair of crystalline tentacles also emerges from its body. Those who have been damaged by a theletos's tentacles describe a disorienting dilemma as they simultaneously feel forced to make a single choice while also being overwhelmed by the endless options available to choose from. Theletoses are more likely than most aeons to interfere in non-aeon societies, particularly in regions with draconian laws. Their involvement is twofold; a theletos concerns itself with both the freedom of individuals and the laws that restrict these individuals, even when the two are in opposition.
