The target isn't [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]], but it can't move beyond the reach of the giant chameleon's tongue. A creature can sever the tongue with an attack that hits AC 15 and deals at least 4 slashing damage. Though this doesn't deal any damage to the giant chameleon, it prevents it from using its tongue Strike until it regrows its tongue, which takes a week."

Giant chameleons are legendary for their ability to change their skin color in response to their surroundings. Their eyes are capable of peering in different directions independently, making them almost as difficult to sneak up on as they are to notice in the first place.
