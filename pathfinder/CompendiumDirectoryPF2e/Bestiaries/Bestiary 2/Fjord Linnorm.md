Its [[Conditions/Dying|Dying]] condition never increases beyond Dying 3 as long as its regeneration is active. However, if it takes damage of a type listed in the regeneration entry, its regeneration deactivates until the end of its next turn. Deactivate the regeneration before applying any damage of a listed type, since that damage might kill the monster by bringing it to Dying 4."

Any creature that fails its save is covered by the ice, which freezes and fuses with the creature's skin, giving it a -10-foot penalty to Speed.

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead spend an action to use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

Fjord linnorms make their homes in damp caves behind ice-cold waterfalls in the river-veined coastal reaches of the north. While they may appear graceful as they swim up the fjords for which they're named, they are as vile as any other of their species and take pleasures in capsizing river boats before gobbling up their terrified crews.
