In transforming xulgaths, drow fleshwarpers sought not to create a new type of creature but to recapture a form of xulgath predecessor believed entirely vanished from Golarion. Ghonhatines are the result-hulking reptilian beasts who prefer to crawl on all fours and tear at their foes with bestial fury.

* * *

Horrid abominations reshaped by vile alchemical magic, the two fleshwarps presented here were created by drow, who transform captured elves or xulgaths into twisted monstrosities that can then be loosed to cause havoc and terror.
