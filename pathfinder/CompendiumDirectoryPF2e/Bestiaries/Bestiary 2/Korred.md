Korreds are reclusive fey in the form of small, hirsute individuals with long, animated manes of hair. While korreds have a natural affinity and admiration for stones and boulders, they prefer to dwell aboveground in areas of rocky forest or wooded hills rather than in caves. Korreds are a private people who don't take kindly to intruders, and they invariably work to drive off or kill any non-fey who stumble into their territory. Staunchly proud of their hair, korreds choose their minimal attire so as to allow their body hair to flow freely, often wearing only a belt with a pouch for throwing rocks and trimming shears-though this belt and pouch are rarely visible under their wild manes.
