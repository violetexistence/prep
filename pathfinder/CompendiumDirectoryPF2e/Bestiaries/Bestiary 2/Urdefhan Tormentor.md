    desc: "`pf2:2` (auditory,divine,emotion,mental) **Frequency** once per day\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The urdefhan lets out a battle cry, sending itself and its allies into a fanatical frenzy. Each ally that hears the call gains a +1 status bonus to attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws, and takes a -1 status penalty to AC. Affected allies must use at least one of their actions to Strike each round, if they are able (even if it means attacking an ally, object, or thin air).\n\nThis lasts for 2d4 rounds.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Stoke the Fervent|Effect: Stoke the Fervent]]"

  - name: "Wicked Bite"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** The urdefhan damaged a creature with a jaws Strike on its last action\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The urdefhan maintains contact, turning the creature's flesh translucent around the site of the injury. The urdefhan chooses one of two options, each of which requires a `DC 22 Fortitude check` save. If the jaws Strike was a critical hit, the creature suffers both effects, using the same save result for both.\n\n*   **Drain Blood** The urdefhan drinks some of the creature's blood. On a failed save, the creature is [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]] and the urdefhan regains 5 healing HP (or, on a critical failure, it's [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 2]] and the urdefhan regains 10 healing HP).\n*   **Drain Vitality** The urdefhan draws out some of the creature's vital essence. The creature becomes [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]] for 1 hour on a failed save (or [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 2]] for 1 hour on a critical failure)."

Urdefhan spellcasters with a knack for the divine are invariably unholy worshippers of daemonkind, typically taking on one of Abaddon's Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse as their patron deity. With their unholy gifts, these urdefhan tormentors summon daemons into battle and bolster their allies with profane magic, preferring to stick to the sidelines rather than enter the fray directly.
