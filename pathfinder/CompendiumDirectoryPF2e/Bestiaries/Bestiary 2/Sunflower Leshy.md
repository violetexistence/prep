    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,polymorph,primal) The sunflower leshy transforms into a Small flower. This ability otherwise uses the effects of [[Spells/One with Plants|One with Plants]].\n* * *\n\nThe monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

Sunflower leshys are the ambassadors and social leaders of their kind. Their petals radiate from their heads in various hues with a serrated, leafy, beard-like ruff. When particularly excited, their eyes and petals glow with collected sunlight, and when they become depressed or saddened, their usually vibrant coloration grows correspondingly muted. These shifts in coloration are echoed in sunflower leshy art, which can lead to unexpected color palettes for artworks. For example, a human artist might illustrate Hell as a place of glowing lava and flickering flames, drawing upon many vibrant colors, but to a sunflower leshy, the only proper way to depict a place like Hell is in morose grays, blacks, and whites.

The more adventurous sunflower leshys leave their communities to grow bonds with nearby settlements of humanoids. When interacting with humanoids, sunflower leshys are some of the most likely to act friendly and give strangers a chance to prove their good intentions, though they remain cautious. They're often accompanied by other, more powerful leshys.
