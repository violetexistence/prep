Simple latches, unsecured chimney flues, loosely shuttered windows, and similar obstacles rarely keep an unkindness away. A raven swarm attempts a Thievery check to bypass many of these simple obstructions, typically against DC 20."

A flock of ravens is known as an unkindness. Certainly the name lives up to its meaning when a swarm of ravens decides to work together. In most cases, a raven swarm like the one presented here won't attack larger foes, but when manipulated by supernatural forces or simple desperation born from hunger, an unkindness of ravens can be a surprisingly dangerous foe.

Few birds are as cunning and social as the raven.
