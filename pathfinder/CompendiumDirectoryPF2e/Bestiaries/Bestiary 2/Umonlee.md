If the creature is standing on the ground, it's [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] as thick ice forms around it, and it can't recover from being slowed. The creature remains immobilized and slowed 1 until it manages to [[Actions/Escape|Escape]] (DC 36) or deal 30 damage to the ice, which has weakness 10 to fire.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, except the creature takes double damage and the ice holding it in place requires 60 damage to break."

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead spend an action to use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

Those who dwell in the coldest climates of Golarion tell of a brutal beast that swims through the ice and snow and can devastate entire villages in minutes. Ancient Erutaki who made their homes in the frozen polar expanse called the Crown of the World named this monster the umonlee.

Umonlees are bestial predators who constantly hunt, rarely resting in service of a hunger that is never fully sated. Despite this animalistic drive, umonlees are semi-intelligent creatures who often select and stalk their prey. However, they are not terribly bright and often keep their hunting grounds in sparsely-trafficked areas. It is rare for an umonlee to attack a village, but one might attack a sparse group, such as a hunting or scouting party. Many caravans traversing the Path of Aganhei-the trade route between the continents of Avistan and Tian Xia that crosses the Crown of the World-have had their expeditions abruptly ended by an encounter with one of these monstrosities.

Those who study monsters posit that umonlees are related to chuuls, as the creatures exhibit some similarities. Both are semi-intelligent, crustacean predators that use ambush tactics to kill and eat their prey. Even though they can talk, umonlees typically only speak Aklo, which also gives credence to this theory. This would also lend to the theory that chuuls are products of alghollthu manipulation, meaning that umonlees are also the results of these alien designs. However, the fact that these creatures aren't evil argues well against such a theory.
