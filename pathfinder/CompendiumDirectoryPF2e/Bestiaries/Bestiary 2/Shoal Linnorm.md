However, if it takes damage of a type listed in the regeneration entry, its regeneration deactivates until the end of its next turn.

    desc: "`pf2:2` (fire,primal,water) The shoal linnorm exhales scalding steam that deals 12d8 fire damage in a 60-foot cone (`DC 36 Reflex check` save). The steam lingers until the end of the linnorm's next turn; anyone who enters the area or begins their turn in the area takes 6d8 fire damage (`DC 36 Reflex check` save negates). During this time, the steam is so thick that it impedes movement as well as sight, turning the area into difficult terrain. All creatures in the steam become [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]], and all creatures outside the steam become concealed to creatures within it.\n\nThe shoal linnorm can't use Breath Weapon again for 1d4 rounds."

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead spend an action to use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

Shoal linnorms occupy rocky shoreline shallows and slither along lonely coastlines. While they do not intentionally seek out large settlements, these linnorms nonetheless beleaguer fishers headed out from small coastal towns, and they may even follow skiffs back to their home port to appraise the town's defenses and plan a raid. Shoal linnorms tend to hunt large prey, both underwater and on land. Their preferred quarries includes giant squid and grizzly bears-meals rich in fat, which the linnorms metabolize into the fiery steam that courses through their veins.
