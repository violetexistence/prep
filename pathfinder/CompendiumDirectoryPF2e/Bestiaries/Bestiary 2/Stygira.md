If a creature is reduced to 0 Hit Points from the stygira's claw Strike and fails the saving throw against stone curse, it is [[Conditions/Petrified|Petrified]]. A creature that spends 8 hours in direct sunlight can attempt a new saving throw to remove the effects of stone curse, even if it has been petrified."

Withered hermits wrapped in tattered rags, these scarred, eyeless creatures command strange secrets of the earth and interpret the fateful energies of the subterranean depths. In some regions, stygiras are worshipped as seers or even gods, although they lack the ability to grant spells to clerics and are often not aware of their worshippers at all. In other areas, they have strange ties to the ancient empires of the cyclopes, often dwelling in the oversized ruins those creatures left behind long ago. To many stygiras, gemstones harvested from ancient cyclopean mosaics have even greater magical properties than other crystals.

Although technically blind, stygiras do have vestigial eyes hidden beneath the stony, scarred flesh of their faces. Capable of sensing bright lights even through their scars, stygiras are sickened and distracted by these flashing glimpses, so they keep to their caves during the day and wander into the world above only after nightfall. Far from benevolent, they seek out unwary travelers or explorers to capture and reduce them down to the base chemicals and supernatural humors the stygiras require to infuse gemstones with the capacity to give them sight and magical power.
