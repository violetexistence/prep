  - name: "Beckoning Call"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (auditory,concentrate,incapacitation,mental,primal) The rusalka cries out a compelling invitation. Each non-fey creature within a 300-foot emanation must attempt a `DC 27 Will check` save. The effect lasts for 1 round, but if the rusalka uses Beckoning Call again on subsequent rounds, the duration extends by 1 round for all affected creatures. Once a creature succeeds at any save against Beckoning Call, that creature is temporarily immune for 24 hours.\n* * *\n\n**Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Fascinated|Fascinated]] and must spend each of its actions to move closer to the rusalka, avoiding obvious dangers. If a beckoned creature is adjacent to the rusalka, it stays still and doesn't act. If attacked by the rusalka, the creature is freed from captivation at the end of the rusalka's turn.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but if attacked by the rusalka, the creature can attempt a new save only at the start of its next turn, rather than being freed at the end of the rusalka's turn."

The rusalka moves each creature they succeed against up to 10 feet and each creature they critically succeed against up to 20 feet. This movement must all be within reach of its tresses."

  - name: "Shameful Touch"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (emotion,mental,primal) The rusalka touches a creature within 5 feet using their hand, stirring up memories of regret and shame. The target must attempt a `DC 35 Will check` save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The target is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]].\n\n**Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] and [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]].\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] and [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]], and it must use its first action on its next turn to Strike itself, automatically hitting."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Improved Grab|Improved Grab]]"
    desc: "  **Requirements** The monster's last action was a successful Strike that lists Improved Grab in its damage entry, or the monster has a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]\n* * *\n\n**Effect** If used after a Strike, the monster attempts to [[Actions/grapple|grapple]] the creature using the body part it attacked with as a free action. This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead spend an action to use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

These androgynous, river-dwelling fey delight in manipulating the emotions of those unfortunate enough to fall into their grasp, using humiliation to break their victims' wills. Rusalkas enjoy keeping their broken toys nearby, both for continuing entertainment and to aid in the rusalkas' defense, as the shame their captives feel often drives them to become obsessively loyal to these fey.
