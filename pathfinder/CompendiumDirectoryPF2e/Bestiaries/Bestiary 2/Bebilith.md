While demons control much of the Abyss, even they are hunted in the wilder regions of this horrific plane. The most notorious of these predators-though not the deadliest-is the bebilith. These fiends resemble elephant-sized spiders with glowing eyes, barbed chitin, and a fanged maw dripping caustic fluid.

Many demons and planar travelers have underestimated bebiliths' devious intellects, believing them to be little more than oversized vermin. Bebiliths take advantage of this, ambushing foes with unexpected tactics. While they lash out at any creatures they encounter, they take great pleasure in chewing on demonic flesh. Qlippoth are the only creatures bebiliths never consume.
