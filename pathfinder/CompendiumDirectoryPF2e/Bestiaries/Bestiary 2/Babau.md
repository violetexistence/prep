The babau is an assassin, a murderer, and a sadist-certainly not unusual traits, yet their penchant for stealth and surprise sets them apart from their kin. Babaus form from mortal souls of lone killers-those who took pleasure in more personal murders, and particularly those with grisly patterns to their killings.
