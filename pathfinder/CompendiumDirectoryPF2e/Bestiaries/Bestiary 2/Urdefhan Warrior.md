    desc: "`pf2:2`  The urdefhan makes one rhoka sword Strike and one jaws Strike against a single creature. Its multiple attack penalty doesn't increase until after both attacks."

  - name: "Wicked Bite"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** The urdefhan damaged a creature with a jaws Strike on its last action\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The urdefhan maintains contact, turning the creature's flesh translucent around the site of the injury. The urdefhan chooses one of two options, each of which requires a `DC 20 Fortitude check` save. If the jaws Strike was a critical hit, the creature suffers both effects, using the same save result for both.\n\n*   **Drain Blood** The urdefhan drinks some of the creature's blood. On a failed save, the creature is [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]] and the urdefhan regains 5 healing HP (or, on a critical failure, it's [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 2]] and the urdefhan regains 10 healing HP).\n*   **Drain Vitality** The urdefhan draws out some of the creature's vital essence. The creature becomes [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]] for 1 hour on a failed save (or [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 2]] for 1 hour on a critical failure)."

From the moment they are born, urdefhans are prepared for war. Urdefhan warriors are among the least powerful urdefhans one might encounter outside of their eerie underground cities.
