At the start of a head's turn, that head gets 2 actions and 1 reaction. Each brain controls one of the troll's arms, but both can move the legs.\n\nAny ability that would sever a two-headed troll's head (such as the [[Equipment/Vorpal|Vorpal]] weapon property) doesn't cause the two-headed troll to die if they still have their other head, but does cause them to lose the turns, actions, and reactions of the severed head.\n\nMental effects that target a single creature affect only one of the troll's heads."

    desc: "  This monster regains the listed number of Hit Points each round at the beginning of its turn. Its [[Conditions/Dying|Dying]] condition never increases beyond Dying 3 as long as its regeneration is active. However, if it takes damage of a type listed in the regeneration entry, its regeneration deactivates until the end of its next turn. Deactivate the regeneration before applying any damage of a listed type, since that damage might kill the monster by bringing it to Dying 4."

If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, the monster disrupts that action.

Two-headed trolls are savage, dual-minded monsters with an unquenchable thirst for bloodshed, and dread tales of their ravenous appetites are whispered of in homesteads throughout the lands of the Inner Sea. Indeed, it is a custom for parents to invoke the two-headed troll as a warning to misbehaving children. "Finish your chores," a parent might say to a stubborn child, "or a two-headed troll will snatch you away at night and swallow you whole!" It's unclear why such a morbid tradition gained traction with parents, but it's an undeniable fact that two-headed trolls have an appetite for "nibbles"-creatures small enough to devour with one bite.

Mature two-headed trolls stand 13 feet in height, weighing roughly 1,700 pounds. Unlike common trolls, two-headed trolls share the upright gait of their ettin ancestry and do not walk hunched over.
