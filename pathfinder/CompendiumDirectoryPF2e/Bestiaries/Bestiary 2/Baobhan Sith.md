If the creature ends its movement or turn adjacent to the fey, it is [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] until the end of its next turn.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature must spend each of its actions moving closer to the baobhan sith, and if it ends its movement or turn adjacent to the fey, it is [[Conditions/Paralyzed|Paralyzed]] until the end of its next turn."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Change Shape|Change Shape]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,polymorph,primal) The baobhan sith can transform into a large raven, with the effects from the bird option in the [[Spells/Aerial Form|Aerial Form]] spell.\n* * *\n\nThe monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

  - name: "Drink Blood"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** A bleeding creature is within the baobhan sith's reach\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The baobhan sith tries to Drink the Blood from the bleeding creature's wounds. The baobhan sith attempts an `Athletics check` check against the victim's Fortitude DC. On a success, the victim becomes [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]] and the baobhan sith regains 10 healing HP, gaining any Hit Points in excess of their maximum Hit Points as temporary Hit Points.\n\nDrinking Blood from a victim that's already drained doesn't restore any Hit Points to the baobhan sith but increases the victim's drained value by 1. A victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires 10 minutes, a successful `DC 20 Medicine check` check, and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drained value by 1."

Undeath is rare in the fey realm of the First World, for that plane's infusion with the raw power of life makes undead uncomfortable at best. Yet a few fey have adopted the vile practices and habits of notorious undead while still being living themselves, as seen in the blood-drinking habits of the murderous baobhan sith.

A baobhan sith avoids confrontations when outnumbered, and although territorial, they won't reveal their true nature to larger groups. They prefer to drink blood from victims they find attractive, and they avoid drinking blood from animals and beasts entirely, as they consider such activities to be uncultured.
