Deactivate the regeneration before applying any damage of a listed type, since that damage might kill the monster by bringing it to Dying 4."

These spherical knots of sinewy muscle, serrated blades, and bloody metal are the most common velstracs on the Shadow Plane. Each augur has only a single eye, from which they can see the horrors inflicted by other velstracs, who train the augur to expect and appreciate pain. Augurs are 1 foot in diameter and weigh 30 pounds.
