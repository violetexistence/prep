Jyotis are sometimes called "false phoenixes" by the ignorant or willful. These avian humanoids are native to the Forge of Creation. They rarely leave this enigmatic realm and view visitors from other planes as stains on the purity of their home. Jyotis particularly distrust divine spellcasters and religious warriors, seeing them as inclined to take credit for manifesting a life force that, from the jyotis' perspective, is as plentiful and ubiquitous as water is to fish.

Despite their distrust of intruders, jyotis rarely attack unprovoked when their homes are not threatened. They are intolerant, however, of those who intrude on the palaces of crystallized light and captured flame in which they dwell. They often chase even those who come bearing gifts away; few visitors have anything they desire, for what they desire most is to be left alone. The jyotis' full wrath is reserved for natives of the Shadow Plane and the Void. Historically, the promise of battle with the gargoyle-like sceaduinars, whom they consider it their duty to oppose, has been the only thing to lure jyoti armies beyond the Forge of Creation.
