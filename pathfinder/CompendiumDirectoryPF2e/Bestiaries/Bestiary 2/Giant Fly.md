This pony-sized fly's twitching limbs seem to never stop moving as it constantly cleans itself and scoops anything edible into its mouthparts. While primarily carrion eaters, giant flies sometimes prey on livestock or other animals too slow to get away.

Giant flies are pony-sized insects that have massive compound eyes and bodies bristling with short, stiff hairs. Their lairs are notorious for the rotting meat they stockpile to lay their eggs into. Their maggot-dens are also prime breeding grounds for virulent diseases.
