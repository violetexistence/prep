Each creature within the emanation that was deceived by Sound Mimicry must succeed at a `DC 19 Will check` save or become [[Conditions/Fascinated|Fascinated]] and compelled to move toward the sound of the leucrotta's voice on their turn. Fascinated creatures are also [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]].\n\nIf the leucrotta attacks, the fascinated condition ends only for the creature that is attacked. If the leucrotta speaks a creature's name while using its Luring Cry, that creature takes a -2 circumstance penalty to their saving throw to resist the ability.\n\nOn a successful save, a creature is temporarily immune to Luring Cry for 24 hours."

  - name: "Sound Mimicry"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  The leucrotta perfectly imitates voices and speech and attempts a `Deception check` check against listeners' Will DC to fool them. The leucrotta gains a +4 bonus to this Deception check if it has listened to the creature it's imitating for at least 10 minutes at any point in the last 24 hours. The leucrotta can't duplicate voice-based abilities or spells, though it can perfectly mimic the sound of verbal spellcasting and can attempt to deceive constructs or undead that respond to voice commands. The leucrotta can't imitate speech in languages it doesn't know."

The vile and vicious offspring of a demon lord and a monstrous species of hyenas, leucrottas are intelligent and cruel beasts. They use their astounding vocal mimicry to lure unsuspecting creatures near so that they can first torment and then devour them. Leucrottas measure 5 feet at the shoulder and weigh 800 pounds, and they are perpetually filthy. A leucrotta's oversized jaws are lined with rows of jagged, hardened bony ridges rather than teeth, and it can shear through flesh, bone, and even steel with ease.
