Hamatulas are forged in Erebus to protect infernal vaults from those foolish enough to try to rob the archdevil Mammon. In case the vicious spines protruding from their bodies and ability to teleport weren't deadly enough, they are also clever wielders of warding glyphs. They are effective conjured guardians, though they resent being pulled away from their duties in Hell. Unlike most fiends, hamatulas are formed from several souls that lack any features distinctive enough to merit another role.
