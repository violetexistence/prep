Born with elemental gales coursing through their breath, sylphs are wispy planar scions whose bodies seem caught in a perpetual, gentle breeze. Born of unions between mortals and djinn, sylphs are quick-witted and creative, but they are prone to flights of fancy and tend to be easily distracted.

Sylphs are notorious for their practice of "listening to the wind," which most others dismiss as a fancy name for eavesdropping. Yet this custom means much more to sylphs, who spend hours listening to the stories brought to them on the proverbial breeze. While some less scrupulous sylphs may use the information they learn to blackmail or abuse others, most of them see listening to the wind as their way of staying connected to the world around them while still keeping it comfortably at arm's length. Certainly the typical sylph sneak doesn't seek to use what they learn for ill, but instead tries to warn others of dangers yet unrealized or to prepare themself for a dangerous task.
