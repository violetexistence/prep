If it succeeds, it envelops the target, who is [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]. Attacks that hit an enveloping cloaker deal half their damage to the cloaker and half to the trapped victim. The cloaker can't Fly, and when it moves using its land Speed it moves the enveloped creature with it. The cloaker can make only jaws Strikes against the restrained creature but can make tail Strikes against other creatures.\n\nA creature that voluntarily puts on the cloaker becomes engulfed automatically. A cloaker can engulf only Large or smaller creatures, and no more than one creature at a time."

Because the moan is infrasonic, most humanoids don't detect the source of their plight if they aren't already aware of the cloaker.\n\n*   **Fear** (fear, incapacitation) `DC 22 Will check` Each creature within a 30-foot emanation becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]] (or, on a critical failure, [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] and [[Conditions/Fleeing|Fleeing]] until the end of its next turn).\n*   **Nausea** `DC 22 Will check` Each creature within a 30-foot emanation falls [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] and become [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]].\n*   **Stupor** `DC 22 Will check` The cloaker targets a single creature within 30 feet. The creature becomes [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] and [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] for 1 minute."

Weird and paranoid creatures that dwell in the Darklands, cloakers resemble hideous, flying manta rays. Crafty and careful hunters, their motivations, their patterns of attack, and even their societies and history are often an inscrutable jumble of contradicting reports, confused rumors, and terrifying accounts.

Like many of the stranger creatures of Golarion, cloakers were originally created by the alghollthus, who bred them to spy on their Azlanti thralls. Upon the fall of the Azlanti empire, the alghollthus cast out their cloaker creations, who, in turn, fled to the lower reaches of the Darklands. Amid the vaults and twisted corridors of their new home, their attitudes-particularly regarding their apprehension toward their former masters-changed dramatically. Suspicion became paranoia, egotism, sadism, and much worse. Now, most cloakers lead solitary lives, stalking the Darklands for easy prey and delving deeper into internal horrors. Their paranoia is so great that they interact only rarely even with their own kind, encountering another cloaker only briefly to mate before flitting back to isolation.

But there are exceptions. Every so often, a charismatic cloaker priest can call together a dark cabal of these creatures and other Darklands denizens to worship unspeakable ancient gods. These rare cloakers whip their acolytes and followers into a frenzy of dark rituals and heinous acts. While these cults are depraved and destructive, they rarely survive longer than their founder.
