Ankhrav hive mothers are fearsome predators that one can easily distinguish from the typical ankhrav not only by their greater size, but the presence of a large pair of razor-sharp, mantis-like arms.

Ankhravs are immense, burrowing, and insectile predators, considered by inhabitants of the rural areas of the world to be an all-too-common plague.
