Horned archons are secretive and tireless sentinels and scouts, patrolling the Outer Sphere's untamed wilds for evil to eliminate and keeping small communities safe from demons, devils, and worse. They resemble muscular humans with the head, horns, and legs of a stag. When requested to do so by their patrons, especially Erastil, they journey to the Material Plane and patrol dangerous frontier areas, secretly performing acts of kindness such as leading hunters to food, helping lost children, and driving off evil creatures. Because they roam the wilds of Nirvana and Elysium, horned archons are among the best at understanding the perspectives of other celestials.

* * *

Archons are guardians of Heaven and enemies of chaos and evil. They openly fight back the spread of fiends but also quietly nurture the seeds of virtue within mortals, teaching the denizens of the Material Plane how to act with honor and integrity, enact just laws, and cast off sin and temptation.

Archons live in the immense seven-tiered mountain of Heaven. They manifest in the Garden at the mountain's peak from mortal souls who answer a mysterious voice. There they swear to forever serve the cause of justice and transform into their new archon forms. Intensely orderly in their metamorphosis, new archons begin as lantern archons or other lesser forms, transforming into ever-greater archons as their virtue and achievements grow. Each archon represents a particular virtue, such as hope, charity, justice, or courage, and they gain strength in the presence of mortals who exemplify this virtue. Due to their extremely lawful nature, archons sometimes find themselves at odds with azatas.
