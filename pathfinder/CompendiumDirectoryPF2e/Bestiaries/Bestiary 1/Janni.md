Jann are genies composed of all four elements, meaning they are not quite home on any of the Elemental Planes. Instead, jann reside on the Material Plane, making only brief forays to the other parts of the Inner Sphere. Although they are human in size and appearance, jann are not at all related to humans and bristle at any claims to this effect. They are a proud people and take great care to maintain their honor-restoring that honor with the edge of a sword, if necessary.

* * *

A unique type of genie exists for each Elemental Plane, and the bodies of genies are formed out of elemental matter corresponding to their native plane: djinn are formed from wind, clouds, and storms; efreet are fire made flesh; marids are beings of water; and shaitans are composed of metal, gems, and stone. Lastly, the jann are formed out of all four elements, and are the weakest of geniekind.
