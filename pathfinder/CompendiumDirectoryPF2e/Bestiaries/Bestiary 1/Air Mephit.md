Air mephits are capricious and flighty relative to their kin; they are as likely to fly blindly into battle as they are to whine in terror at a loud noise. They are pale blue in coloration and have thin wings that trail small puffs of vapor as they fly through the skies.

* * *

Mephits-sometimes known as elemental scamps-are little bipedal critters with bat-like wings who serve stronger elementals on the Elemental Planes or neophyte spellcasters who summon them to the Material Plane. All mephits have an inkling of magical power as well as a breath weapon.
