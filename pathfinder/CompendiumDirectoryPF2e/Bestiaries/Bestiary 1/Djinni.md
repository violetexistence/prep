Benevolent genies from the Plane of Air, djinn value art, culture, knowledge, and trade. They also love new experiences, succulent dishes, and heady wines. Of all geniekind, they are most likely to approach humans and other mortals, interacting with them on friendly terms. Still, djinn are proud of their genie heritage and have a tendency to be patronizing toward mortals, a habit that has earned them a reputation for arrogance.

Djinn get along with jann and marids, but they find shaitans too stiff and harbor undying hatred for efreet. Although djinn are formidable combatants, they despise war and prefer to eschew violence in favor of dealing with their opponents using magic or subterfuge (making an exception, of course, when they encounter efreet).

* * *

A unique type of genie exists for each Elemental Plane, and the bodies of genies are formed out of elemental matter corresponding to their native plane: djinn are formed from wind, clouds, and storms; efreet are fire made flesh; marids are beings of water; and shaitans are composed of metal, gems, and stone. Lastly, the jann are formed out of all four elements, and are the weakest of geniekind.
