  - name: "Dance of Ruin"
    desc: "`pf2:3` (divine,electricity,manipulate,move) The vrock dances in flight and chants to create a ruinous explosion of electricity. If more vrocks within 30 feet want to join the dance, the vrock can delay the dance to wait for more vrocks; in that case, the effect occurs after the last vrock uses Dance of Ruin or one of the vrocks chooses to complete that round of the dance. Each non-demon creature in a 20-foot emanation from any of the dancing vrocks takes 2d12 electricity damage (`DC 28 Reflex check` save). For each additional vrock that joins the dance, the damage increases by 1d12 and the save DC increases by 1 (to a maximum of four vrocks dealing 5d12 electricity damage with a DC 31 save). The vrocks can continue dancing by using Dance of Ruin each round, for up to 3 rounds in total. The emanation's size increases by 20 feet each round, and the damage increases by 1d12 per vrock each round.\n* * *\n\n  \n\n| Round | Emanation Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1 | 20-foot emanation |\n| 2 | 40-foot emanation |\n| 3 | 60-foot emanation |"

  - name: "Spore Cloud"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (disease,poison) The vrock emits a cloud of spores from their body, dealing 2d8 poison damage to all adjacent creatures. Each creature damaged this way must succeed at a `DC 28 Fortitude check` save or take 2d8 persistent piercing damage as the spores penetrate its skin and grow into thick, green vines. The vines cease growing after 10 rounds, and they wither away in 1d4 days if not shaved off before then. The vines can be destroyed if the creature is affected by a good spell or if _[[Equipment/Holy Water|Holy Water]]_ is applied to the vines (with an Interact action).\n\nOnce the vrock uses Spore Cloud, the ability can't be used for 1d6 rounds."

  - name: "Stunning Screech"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (auditory,divine,incapacitation,sonic) **Frequency** once per minute.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The vrock emits a shrill screech. Each non-demon creature within a 30-foot burst must attempt a `DC 28 Fortitude check` save. On a failure, the creature is [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 2]], and on a critical failure, it's [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 3]]."

When the gates to the Abyss swing wide, the first demons through are often vrocks, vulture-headed scions of rage who wheel through the air on black wings or dance with the exultation of their fiendish power. Their hatred for mortals is matched only by their desire to inflict suffering through their horrible screech or their devastating dance. Vrocks form from the souls of hateful mortals who are thus given another chance to inflict their rage on the world.

Vrocks often travel in small groups so as to make the best use of their dance of ruin ability, but they rarely appear in groups larger than four. Against small groups and individuals, they swoop down without fear, hoping to play with their prey before going for the kill. Against formidable foes, they are just as happy to fly above, using their dance of ruin to cast a storm of lightning down on them.

* * *

When a sinful mortal soul is judged and sent on to the Abyss, it can become a deadly fiend-a demon. Demons are living incarnations of sin-be they classic sins like wrath or gluttony, or more "specialized" depravities like an obsession with torture or the act of treason or treachery. Once formed, a demon's driving goals are twofold-the amassing of personal power, and the corruption of mortal souls to cause them to become tainted by sin. In this way demons ensure a never-ending supply of new demons to bolster their ever-growing ranks in the Abyss.
