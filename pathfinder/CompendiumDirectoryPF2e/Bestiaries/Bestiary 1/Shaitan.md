Hailing from the Plane of Earth, shaitans are proud and brazen genies. They value physical skill and love bargaining, games of chance, and working with metal and stone. Immense gemstones and veins of precious metal crisscross their home plane, and the industrious shaitans have built a vast mercantile empire from these abundant natural resources.

* * *

A unique type of genie exists for each Elemental Plane, and the bodies of genies are formed out of elemental matter corresponding to their native plane: djinn are formed from wind, clouds, and storms; efreet are fire made flesh; marids are beings of water; and shaitans are composed of metal, gems, and stone. Lastly, the jann are formed out of all four elements, and are the weakest of geniekind.
