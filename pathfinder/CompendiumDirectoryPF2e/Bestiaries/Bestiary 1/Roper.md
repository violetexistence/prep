  - name: "Pull the Strands"
    desc: "`pf2:2`  The roper pulls every creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] by its strands toward itself. The roper rolls a single `Athletics check` check and compares the result to each [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] creature's Fortitude DC. The roper pulls each creature it succeeds against up to 25 feet closer and each creature it critically succeeds against up to 50 feet closer."

  - name: "Sticky Strand"
    desc: "  Any creature hit by a roper's strand is [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]] and [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]]. Each additional hit from a strand increases the enfeebled condition value by 1 (to a maximum of enfeebled 4). This enfeebled value decreases by 1 every 8 hours. The roper can move while it has a creature grabbed with a strand, but it automatically releases the creature if it moves beyond the strand's reach. The roper can release an grabbed creature as a free action. A creature can sever a strand with a target attack that hits AC 27 and deals at least 18 slashing damage. This doesn't deal any damage to the roper itself, though it can no longer attack with a severed strand."

To all but the most sharp-eyed underground explorers, a roper appears to be nothing more than a large stalactite, stalagmite, or pillar of ice. Cunning and patient ambush predators, ropers use this to their advantage.

Ropers do not form large societies (although they can often be found living alongside other deep-dwelling denizens), but they often congregate in small clusters and sometimes hunt in groups. Particularly interested in the philosophy of life and death and the flner points of the more cruel and sinister religions of the world, a roper can talk or argue for hours with those it initially sought merely to eat. Quick-thinking spelunkers can sometimes stave off a roper's appetite by entertaining it with stories or discussions of philosophy, but ropers do not willingly allow such intriguing prey to escape alive. Stories speak of particularly skilled debaters and philosophers who have been kept for days or even years as pets or conversational companions by roper clusters, but in the end, if such pets don't eventually escape, the ropers' appetites win out over their intellectual curiosity-especially in cases where the pets constantly outmaneuver their keepers' wits and patience. A roper is 9 feet tall and weighs 2,200 pounds.
