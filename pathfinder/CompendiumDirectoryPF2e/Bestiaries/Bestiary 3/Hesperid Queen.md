    desc: "  A hesperid queen is intrinsically tied to a isolated region, usually an island or island chain, a remote coast, or secluded valley. As long as the queen is healthy, the environment is exceptionally resilient, allowing the hesperid queen to automatically attempt to counteract spells and rituals such as [[Spells/Blight|Blight]] that would harm the environment, with a +37 counteract modifier and a counteract rank of 10.\n\nWhen the hesperid queen becomes physically or psychologically unhealthy, however, her warded region eventually becomes twisted or unhealthy as well. In that case, restoring the hesperid queen swiftly heals the entire region."

  - name: "[[Creature Family Ability Glossary/(Nymph Queen) Change Shape|Change Shape]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (polymorph,primal) Hesperid queens can transform between their original form, which looks much like a typical nymph of their kind, and any Small or Medium humanoid form, typically choosing a version of their natural form that more closely resembles a humanoid.\n* * *\n\nThe monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

    desc: "`pf2:2` (primal) While the hesperid queen is within their bonded location, they can spin golden light around an object they're holding of up to 20 cubic feet in volume and up to 80 Bulk. Doing so condenses the object into a magic apple made of golden light with light Bulk.\n\nThe golden apple reverts back to its original shape after a full day away from the hesperid's bonded location, or when the hesperid queen spends a single action (which has the concentrate trait) to end the effect."

  - name: "[[Creature Family Ability Glossary/(Nymph Queen) Focus Beauty|Focus Beauty]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (emotion,incapacitation,mental,primal,visual) The hesperid queen focuses her beauty upon a target within her aura. The creature must attempt a `DC 38 Will check` save. On a failure, it is affected as if by the hesperid queen's nymph's beauty aura; if it was already affected by the aura, it becomes overwhelmed with visions of bliss and beauty. The creature departs from the hesperid queen's domain as quickly and efficiently as it can for 1 hour, after which time it forgets ever reaching the hesperid queen's domain, how it did so, and everything that happened while it was within the domain."

  - name: "[[Creature Family Ability Glossary/(Nymph Queen) Inspiration|Inspiration]]"
    desc: "`pf2:3` (emotion,mental,primal) A hesperid queen can inspire a single intelligent creature by giving that creature a token of her favor, typically a lock of her hair. As long as the creature carries her token and remains in good standing with the lampad queen, the creature gains a +1 status bonus to all Crafting checks, Performance checks, and Will saves.\n\nIf a hesperid queen grants her Inspiration to a bard and they are that bard's muse, the bard gains an additional benefit depending on their muse theme: for lore muse, the bard also gains a +1 status bonus to all Lore checks; for maestro muse, the status bonus to Performance checks increases to +2 for the purpose of determining the effects of compositions; for polymath muse, the bard gains a +4 status bonus to untrained skill checks; and for all other muses, the Will save bonus increases to +2 against fey.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Nymph Queen's Inspiration|Effect: Nymph Queen's Inspiration]]"

Hesperid queens rule over isolated regions soaked in the light of sunset. They guard countless treasures and secrets, though for those who approach them with respect and offer an intriguing bargain, they're willing to part with knowledge or items beyond those secrets or valuables they've sworn to keep to themselves.

Hesperid queens are relatively likely to have powerful objects under their protection, such as ancient relics or artifacts. As such, they're keenly aware of the danger posed by unscrupulous treasure hunters seeking to obtain these items at any cost, and they use their incredible minds to set up devious countermeasures to protect their wards, even in the event of their own deaths.

* * *

Nymphs are fey guardians of nature possessed of great beauty and forms that meld breathtaking humanoid features with the natural elements they guard. Nymph queens are powerful nymphs who rule over and protect a much greater territory of untouched wilderness. For instance, a lampad might guard a beautiful underground cavern, but a lampad queen might call an entire system of caves their domain.
