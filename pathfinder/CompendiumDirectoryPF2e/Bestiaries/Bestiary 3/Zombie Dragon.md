The rotted husk of a once great dragon, this abomination has lost all its former splendor, but none of the ferocity. Its patchy, rotted wings don't generate enough lift to keep it aloft, but the foul necromantic energies animating it still allow it to fly, albeit slowly.

* * *

Necromancers most often create these mindless undead as obedient, expendable servitors. Left to its own devices, a zombie seeks only to consume the living, stopping only when its rotting body can no longer hold together.
