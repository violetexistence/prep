    desc: "  A lampad queen is intrinsically tied to a specific underground region, usually a cave system. As long as the queen is healthy, the environment is exceptionally resilient, allowing the lampad queen to automatically attempt to counteract spells and rituals such as [[Spells/Blight|Blight]] that would harm the environment, with a +30 counteract modifier and a counteract rank of 8.\n\nWhen the lampad queen becomes physically or psychologically unhealthy, however, her warded region eventually becomes twisted or unhealthy as well. In that case, restoring the lampad queen swiftly heals the entire region."

  - name: "[[Creature Family Ability Glossary/(Nymph Queen) Change Shape|Change Shape]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (polymorph,primal) Lampad queens can transform between their original form, which looks much like a typical nymph of their kind, and any Small or Medium humanoid form, typically choosing a version of their natural form that more closely resembles a humanoid.\n* * *\n\nThe monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

  - name: "Despairing Weep"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (auditory,emotion,mental,primal) **Frequency** once per round\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The lampad queen begins a heart-wrenching fit of weeping, inspiring sympathetic sobbing in nearby creatures. Each non-lampad creature within 120 feet who hears the lampad's weeping must succeed at a `DC 36 Will check` save with the effects of [[Spells/Wave of Despair|Wave of Despair]]."

  - name: "[[Creature Family Ability Glossary/(Nymph Queen) Focus Beauty|Focus Beauty]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (emotion,incapacitation,mental,primal,visual) The nymph queen focuses her beauty upon a target within her aura. The creature must attempt a `DC 33 Will check` save. On a failure, it is affected as if by the nymph queen's nymph's beauty aura; if it was already affected by the aura, the conflicting emotions from the lampad queen's beauty intensify, causing the target to no longer get a flat check to end the confusion when it takes damage. The lampad queen can use a single action, which has the concentrate trait, to focus the emotions of a [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]] creature toward a particular emotion, causing it to spend its next turn sobbing uncontrollably, fawning over the lampad queen, or otherwise performing no actions beyond experiencing its emotions.\n\nRegardless of the save, the target is temporarily immune to Focus Beauty until the start of the lampad queen's next turn."

  - name: "[[Creature Family Ability Glossary/(Nymph Queen) Inspiration|Inspiration]]"
    desc: "`pf2:3` (emotion,mental,primal) A lampad queen can inspire a single intelligent creature by giving that creature a token of her favor, typically a lock of her hair. As long as the creature carries her token and remains in good standing with the lampad queen, the creature gains a +1 status bonus to all Crafting checks, Performance checks, and Will saves.\n\nIf a lampad queen grants her Inspiration to a bard and they are that bard's muse, the bard gains an additional benefit depending on their muse theme: for lore muse, the bard also gains a +1 status bonus to all Lore checks; for maestro muse, the status bonus to Performance checks increases to +2 for the purpose of determining the effects of compositions; for polymath muse, the bard gains a +4 status bonus to untrained skill checks; and for all other muses, the Will save bonus increases to +2 against fey.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Nymph Queen's Inspiration|Effect: Nymph Queen's Inspiration]]"

Lampad queens are capricious monarchs and protectors of vast underground domains, regarded in ballads and tales as allies and foes, monsters and muses. Lampad queens have a particular animosity for the many predominantly evil underground ancestries, such as drow and duergar, and they are particularly fond of bats. Many lampad queens have nykteras as favored attendants.

* * *

Nymphs are fey guardians of nature possessed of great beauty and forms that meld breathtaking humanoid features with the natural elements they guard. Nymph queens are powerful nymphs who rule over and protect a much greater territory of untouched wilderness. For instance, a lampad might guard a beautiful underground cavern, but a lampad queen might call an entire system of caves their domain.
