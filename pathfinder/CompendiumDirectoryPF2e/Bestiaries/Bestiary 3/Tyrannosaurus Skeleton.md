The monster can attempt to Trample the same creature only once in a single use of Trample.

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

A massive dinosaur predator makes for a fearsome skeleton.

Almost any creature that had bones in life and leaves them behind in death can become a shambling, undead skeleton-humanoids, beasts, aberrations, fey, and more.
