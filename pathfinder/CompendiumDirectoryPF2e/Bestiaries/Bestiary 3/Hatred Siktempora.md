Spawned by acts and legacies of cold-blooded spite, hatred siktemporas kill indiscriminately out of pure loathing, methodically hunting down and slaughtering anyone who catches their vile attention. Fortunately for mortals, they typically limit their predations to the Dimension of Time, where they hunt down creatures foreign to that realm-and some native to it.

Hatred siktemporas appear roughly humanoid, but their gaunt forms resemble bone and tendon more than flesh and skin. Adding to their unnerving appearance, their legs have an additional segment between their shin and thigh, and likewise for their eerily long arms. Their featureless faces bear only a singular scar, which takes a different form on every hatred siktempora. They clad themselves in immaculate finery chosen from the most vitriolic empires that ever existed, in the past and the future, and they form a magical garrote as a manifestation of their cold malice.

In the Dimension of Time, intense emotions are more than just ethereal feelings. They accumulate over time, from things like the critical mass of emotion caused by a historic event or a settlement passing down a powerful sentiment for generations. These accretions eventually give birth to siktemporas. Each siktempora feels, with all their being, a singular intense emotion linked to the circumstances that spawned them. A rare few, however, are created when an emotionally invested creature attempts to travel to the Dimension of Time or interferes with the flow of time, which can create paradoxes or manipulate past events.

Siktemporas usually isolate themselves on the Dimension of Time in mindscapes infused with the emotion that created them, but some travel to other planes. These wanderers long to indulge in more of their core emotion or to engender more of that feeling, thus perpetuating their own kind.
