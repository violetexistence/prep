Some skull swarms are crafted from the heads of feral and dangerous beasts. These can include predatory cats, bears, dinosaurs, and the like, but just as often they're made from bulls, horses, apes, and other creatures that were gentler in life. In death, a feral skull swarm is bloodthirsty regardless of its origins, with a keen scent for living flesh. Even herbivore skulls diligently chew on the flesh of their swarm's victims.

A skull swarm is composed of reanimated masses of craniums and jawbones, forming a terrifying avalanche of undead fury. Most skull swarms are mindless, though some retain a vestige of wit, awareness, and even magical talents from life, culminating in a highly intelligent swarm mind.
