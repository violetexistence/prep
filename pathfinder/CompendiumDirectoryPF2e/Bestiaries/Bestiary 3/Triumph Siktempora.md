Triumph siktemporas embody the emotional satisfaction of overcoming a task that took up much of a creature's mind, be it taking an apple seed from between one's teeth or winning a war. They exult in every victory they attain; however, they value only those successes won fairly not only abiding by the established rules of a competition but also enforcing those rules mercilessly upon other competitors.

These siktemporas appear as small humanoids with four muscular arms and digitigrade legs. They take great joy in draping themselves in golden clothes and medals that commemorate the countless victories which spawned them, and their faces bear proud, dazzling smiles and expressions of success-but these features never move.

In the Dimension of Time, intense emotions are more than just ethereal feelings. They accumulate over time, from things like the critical mass of emotion caused by a historic event or a settlement passing down a powerful sentiment for generations. These accretions eventually give birth to siktemporas. Each siktempora feels, with all their being, a singular intense emotion linked to the circumstances that spawned them. A rare few, however, are created when an emotionally invested creature attempts to travel to the Dimension of Time or interferes with the flow of time, which can create paradoxes or manipulate past events.

Siktemporas usually isolate themselves on the Dimension of Time in mindscapes infused with the emotion that created them, but some travel to other planes. These wanderers long to indulge in more of their core emotion or to engender more of that feeling, thus perpetuating their own kind.
