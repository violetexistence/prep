Catching a glimpse of a harmona is said to be lucky. Flying quickly, observing and scouting new areas, these brightly colored avian fey are all but hidden to the eye. A soft buzz accompanies them, discernible only to creatures with particularly keen hearing.

Intelligent and curious, these tiny fey birds freely roam the First World, accompanying high-ranking fey creatures such as queens or their courts. In turn, companions who treat a harmona with respect for their knowledge and skill benefit from the harmona's aid in times of need.

When these curious creatures find a natural gate between the planes, they glide through to explore and expand their knowledge. Those who find their way onto the Material Plane often choose to remain there in search of diverse and unusual places. This frequently leads them to the same locations that draw in curious adventurers. A harmona might befriend a non-fey adventurer as a companion, but they resent those who would treat them as pets and fight to the death to avoid capture.
