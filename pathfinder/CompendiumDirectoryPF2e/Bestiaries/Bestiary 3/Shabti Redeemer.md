Cobbled together from broken bits of mortal souls, shabti are facsimiles of wealthy or powerful mortals seeking to escape punishment for their sins upon death. Those rulers and nobles afraid of Pharasma's judgment use the shabti to receive cosmic punishment in their stead. Unaware that they're copies of another soul, shabti endure this fate for some time before being discovered by Pharasma's psychopomps, who reveal the truth to the shabti and strive to met out the avoided punishment to the shabti's creator, using whatever information available. In this case, the shabti is liberated and left to wander Golarion on their own.

Freed but without purpose, many shabti try to recreate the lives that they think they were supposed to lead, replaying out the themes and situations from false memories that fill their heads. Others find themselves tormented for ages by the fact they were solely created to endure punishment for sins committed by another. Some shabti revel in the freedom of their new endless existence, traveling the world in search of sensation and meaning.

A rare few shabti find purpose in aiding Pharasma. They seek to do justice in the god's name and preserve the natural order. Some follow this path as repayment for being freed, while others want to ensure that others don't suffer in their creators' stead.
