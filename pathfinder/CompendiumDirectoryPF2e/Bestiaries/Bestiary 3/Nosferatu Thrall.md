Nosferatu thralls are mortals bound to a nosferatu's will. While thralls aren't undead, they stay alive through unnatural means: feeding on the blood of their masters.

* * *

Among the most ancient of vampires are the nosferatus, twisted remnants of mortals who died in great plagues of old. Perhaps because of their age, nosferatus can no longer create more of their kind. Yet they still lurk among the living, manipulating the hearts and minds of their prey to either serve them beyond the limits of natural life or to become sustenance for the nosferatu like so many others before.
