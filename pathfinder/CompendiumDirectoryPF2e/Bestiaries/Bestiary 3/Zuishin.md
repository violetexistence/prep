If it hits, rather than dealing damage, the arrow is infused with the effects of one of the following of the zuishin's innate divine spells: [[Spells/Breath of Life|Breath of Life]], [[Spells/Heal|Heal]], [[Spells/Cleanse Affliction|Cleanse Affliction]], or [[Spells/Sure Footing|Sure Footing]]. The zuishin must have the spell available to cast, and using this ability expends the spell.\n\nIf the zuishin rolls a failure on the attack roll against an ally who's aware of the arrow and wants to be hit, the attack hits, but on a critical failure, it still misses."

Zuishin are kami warriors and archers who task themselves with watching over important shrines, ancient gates, or sacred doorways. Monasteries secreted away in snowy valleys, pagodas hidden in remote forests, and archways that mark the passage into sacred hidden cities all might host such kami. With sturdy armor and hallowed armaments, zuishin fight tirelessly to drive off any evil powers who wish to desecrate their wards. Of all kami, zuishin most frequently fight against oni, as the wards zuishin guard are most often targeted for desecration by these vile fiends.

Most zuishin wear ancient armor and wield powerful weapons like swords and bows, but some might use spears, axes, or only their fists, depending on their ward and the people who make offerings there. Zuishin tend to regard mortals with skepticism. To earn a zuishin's trust, a supplicant might offer items of natural significance, such as an urn of hallowed earth, a branch from an ancient tree, or an arrangement of local flowers.

Like all kami, a zuishin might come across as reserved or even indifferent to humans and their ilk; however, this impression stems only from a zuishin's wisdom and longevity, which makes mortal affairs seem relatively trivial. In the company of other kami, however, they're unerringly benevolent and readily offer their aid to their fellows. For example, a zuishin whose ward lies nestled in an ancient forest might readily join forces with kodama in those trees to deter foes.

Kami are divine nature spirits native to the lands of Tian Xia, far to the east of the Inner Sea region. They serve as guardians of natural objects and places they protect-their "wards"-and are ancient enemies of the oni. Kami can merge with their wards, allowing them to surreptitiously watch anyone who treads upon their sacred grounds. Kami leave those who they deem harmless alone, but the spirits fight vigilantly to scare away anyone perceived as a threat. Kami choose their own wards, though many mortals seek to attract them to sites that might require protection, leading to a proliferation of certain trees, statues, gates, and other symbolic elements in areas where kami are known to dwell.
