Melixies are hyperactive insect sprites with legendary sweet tooths, capable of drinking down honey, nectar, sugar, and other sweets in alarming quantities. Melixies take the insectile wings common among winged fey and up the ante with antennae and additional insect features, typically shared with bees but sometimes with butterflies, moths, ladybugs, or other beetles. Melixies live in a pattern of rapid consumption of sweets, incredible productivity in tasks of all sorts, and then a crash to sleep it all off and start again. Melixies in their productive state even engage happily in large-scale repetitive tasks that most sprites find dreadfully dull. In their spare time, melixies love to dance, and some of them learn a dancelike sign language called Melisylvan, allowing them to communicate a full range of information through movement.

Tiny winged fey with intense curiosity and adventurous spirits, sprites often find themselves in risky situations and shenanigans belying their stature. While their pixie and grig cousins are most common, numerous additional types of sprites were born from the faerie realm of the First World. These include draxies, melixies, and nykteras, each of which shares commonalities with a different animal or magical creature.
