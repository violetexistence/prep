Though they refused to accept death, wyrmwraiths nonetheless despise their new undead condition. Indeed, lacking in all motivation to collect treasure, a wyrmwraith instead fixates on their hatred of all living things (especially dragons) and their own self-loathing. A wyrmwraith blights the land with their very presence, spreading slowly until their lair becomes a lifeless wasteland haunted by other undead.

* * *

Wyrmwraiths rise from the souls of dragons who refuse to accept death or have an irrational fear of the afterlife.
