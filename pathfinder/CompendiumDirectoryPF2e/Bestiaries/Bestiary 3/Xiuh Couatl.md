Fiercer than other couatls, xiuh couatls (pronounced "shoo") are dedicated to seeking out malevolent creatures and offering a final opportunity at redemption.

Couatls are serpentine celestials who tirelessly help mortals reach their greatest potential all across the planes. Some serve benevolent deities as intermediaries while others serve the cause of good as they see fit.
