Despite their small size, fuaths are shipwreckers incarnate. In the dark of night, these gremlins sever ratlines, slash sails, smash sextants, and soil provisions. Once the ship founders, the fuaths return to indulge their craving for land-raised flesh. While fuaths prefer to take their prey asleep, they save a terrible doom for sailors who attack them, surrounding the mariners' faces in magically congealed water to drown them where they stand.

Constantly dripping with water, fuaths have seahorse-like faces, seaweed-green fur over yellow skin, and wicked lobster claws for hands. Lacking the Sakvroth tongue, they have trouble relating to other gremlins aside from hanivers, but revere sea hags and evil aquatic fey.

Gremlins arose long ago in the First World, living embodiments of nature's ability to wear away, erode, and decompose. On the Material Plane, their encounters with mortal civilizations twisted them into creatures devoted to chaos, sabotage, and traps, each variety specializing in a particular brand of mayhem.
