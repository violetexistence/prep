Calikangs are giant, blue-skinned, six-armed guardians of ancient tombs and treasuries. They each feel a deep, inherent drive to protect and guard, making them highly sought after as wardens and bodyguards. Because most serve as solitary guardians, few calikang societies exist.

Calikangs' unique physiologies enable them to absorb and manipulate electrical magic as well as other energies. They can live for 200 years-though they can further extend their lives via suspended animation. For this reason, many are chosen to guard tombs or other sealed sites where living guardians would perish and constructs would deteriorate.
