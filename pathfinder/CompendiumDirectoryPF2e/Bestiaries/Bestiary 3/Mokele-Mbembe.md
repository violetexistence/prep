Mokele-mbembes are large, reptilian predators found deep within Golarion's jungles. Mwangi view mokele-mbembes as embodiments of nature's strength and majesty, and they consider the sighting of this rare being a sign of favor from the gods and an omen of powerful natural forces. Mokele-mbembes are solitary and excel at going undetected. Most information about them-including the fact that they're voracious predators-comes from following the signs of their passage.
