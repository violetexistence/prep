The most powerful of these monsters, elder wyrmwraiths, sometimes form spontaneously from legendary dragons haunted by an irrational fear of the afterlife, but most have simply existed for over a thousand years, growing in power all the while.

Wyrmwraiths rise from the souls of dragons who refuse to accept death or have an irrational fear of the afterlife.
