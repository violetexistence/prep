Though other squirrels can fall from a great height safely, flying squirrels can soar through the air. Flaps of loose skin between their limbs catch the air to keep them aloft as they leap from greater heights. They can use this technique to escape prey or reach places that would be difficult to climb up to.

The giant variety of flying squirrels dwell in the highest treetops. They're more likely to be in danger from airborne enemies than predators on the ground.

Squirrels' ability to dart into sticky situations, extract berries or nuts from the most precarious of circumstances, and then hide their loot from prying eyes make them nature's thieves in trees. Their cute appearance-soft fur, big eyes, and fluffy tails-makes them inconspicuous and endearing, at least to some. Their reputation among humanoids is split between those who consider them cute little creatures and others who believe they're vermin.

Usually no more than a nuisance on their own, they can become a dangerous annoyance under the command of a druid, fey, or other creature that practices nature magic or is otherwise tied to the natural world. With their ability to reach remote places, excellent eyesight, and adept problem-solving, squirrels can perform effective reconnaissance for druids.
