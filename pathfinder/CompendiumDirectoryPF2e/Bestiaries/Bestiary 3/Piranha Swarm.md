More teeth and fury than body, few fish command as much fear and anxiety as the piranha. They move almost exclusively in schools, overwhelming larger creatures with sheer numbers and ferocity. Piranhas aggress toward sudden disturbances in the water and can smell blood from far away. Harvested piranha teeth serve as excellent cutting tools.

Swimming in vast shoals through open ocean underneath the sparkling sun, lurking deep in the muddy beds of rivers, or schooling in pristine lakes, fish are found nearly anywhere there is water.
