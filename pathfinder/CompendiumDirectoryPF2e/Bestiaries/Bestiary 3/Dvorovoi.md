Traditionally, the dvorovoi is seen as the domovoi's younger sibling and has charge of a peasant's yard and all the animals and tools within. Animals favored by the dvorovoi become healthy, strong, and obedient, while less-loved livestock are exhausted and miserable. Peasants with a resident dvorovoi make sure to formally introduce new livestock to the house spirit and placate the spirit by leaving meals in the shed. Dvorovoi loathe white-furred animals and chase away any all-white cows or horses, though they have no similar grudge against chickens.

House spirits are shy, often helpful, sometimes wrathful fey that dwell alongside peasants and farmers. They reside in the house, in the yard, in the granary, in the bathhouse-wherever people build and live. Due to this proximity, house spirits often take on the mannerisms or appearance of nearby mortals. Their reclusive nature and tendency to go unseen earned them the moniker of "spirits," though in truth they are fully embodied fey.

House spirits take an almost parental interest in "their" mortals. Given proper respect, these fey work tirelessly for their charges-they chop wood, care for livestock, mend clothes, sweep the floor, and tend to the stove. If offended, though, the house spirit becomes a menace, frightening animals or children and ruining belongings.
