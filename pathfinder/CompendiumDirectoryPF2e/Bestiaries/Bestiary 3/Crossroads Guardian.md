When a village is threatened by a horde of bandits but there's no one to help, when a monastery's divine relic must be guarded but the last monk is on their deathbed, when the world can be saved only through the use of an artifact no one alive remembers, nature responds by creating a crossroads guardian, a naturally occurring entity of primal magic. Every crossroads guardian exists to satisfy a particular need-usually a quest that must be carried out, helpless individuals who must be saved from harm, or an object or location which must be guarded. Although they often appear at actual crossroads, a crossroads guardian can materialize anywhere there is a community, from a giant metropolis to a lizardfolk village in a remote swamp.

Some crossroads guardians are martial beings-defending a mystic fountain against all intruders, for example-but most are helpers and assistants, guiding heroes through the wilderness to where they're needed. A guardian is a skilled warrior and can defend a location, but when its purpose involves a quest, or the need is so great that the guardian isn't up to the task alone, the guardian must persuade others to voluntarily accept their quest.

Once a crossroads guardian has fulfilled its purpose, it either shifts to satisfy a new need or quest-often changing its alignment and abilities as well-or else slowly vanishes, returning to the raw primal magic from which it was formed.
