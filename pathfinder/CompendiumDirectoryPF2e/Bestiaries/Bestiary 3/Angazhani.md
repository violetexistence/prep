Angazhanis lurk in the depths of the world's jungles, where these sapient, four-armed apes prey on any creatures they deem lesser than themselves. They're purportedly the divine minions of Angazhan, demon lord of apes. While many angazhanis do worship this foul god, scarce evidence exists to support their claim to fiendish heritage. Jungle-dwelling people know well to steer clear of suspected angazhani territories; angazhanis of such areas don't slaughter outright, often capturing trespassers to serve as slaves or as living sacrifices in heinous rituals.
