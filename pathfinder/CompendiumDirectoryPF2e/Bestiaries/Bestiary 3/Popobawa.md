    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,occult,polymorph) The popobawa can take on the appearance of a human or a Small or Medium bat. It loses its stench aura while transformed. In human form it also loses its Strikes but can make fist Strikes that deal the same amount of bludgeoning damage as its talon Strike.\n* * *\n\nThe monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

Cruel shapechangers, popobawas feed on negative emotions, particularly fear, despair, and anguish. Though they're dangerously strong carnivores that drink the blood of their victims, their greatest pleasure lies in mesmerizing victims to cause suffering and spread chaos. A popobawa moves about populated areas in disguise, seeking new victims and revisiting past victims to bask in their suffering, spreading gossip and incriminating innocents for its crimes while still relishing its own loathsome infamy.
