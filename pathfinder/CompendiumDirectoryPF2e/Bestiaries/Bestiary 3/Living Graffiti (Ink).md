A living graffiti is a painting or drawing that has come to life by magic. These two-dimensional beings can move along any flat surface they touch, including walls, floors, furniture, doors, and even bodies of still water. They can't exist apart from the surfaces they traverse except in brief bursts, which they typically use to harass or attack nearby creatures. They exhibit a mischievous nature and desire to make the real world as much of a caricature as their own two-dimensional domain.

Magic is a complex thing to begin with, and at a certain level of sophistication, the differences between a spell and an autonomous creature become increasingly blurry. Living symbols are constructed creatures of reified and reinforced magic, held together by glyphs, runes, and eldritch formulae.
