    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,polymorph,primal) The cactus leshy transforms into a Small cactus. This ability otherwise uses the effects of [[Spells/One with Plants|One with Plants]].\n* * *\n\nThe monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

These little plants are known for their nettlesome attitude. Their personalities mirror the spines that sprout from all over their bodies, making them cantankerous and slightly prickly, though they are unswervingly loyal to those who earn their trust. At home in dry and arid landscapes, cactus leshys store water inside their bodies in order to survive these harsh conditions.

Cactus leshys come in all different shapes and colors: tall and thin, with beautiful, vibrantly colored blooms on their heads; squat and rotund, with rows and rows of orderly spines; or seemingly haphazard, with flat segments stacked end to end as if they were balancing on one another.

* * *

Often found assisting practitioners of nature magic, leshys are sentient flora that protect the natural world and sacred spaces within forests, fields, and other environments. Leshys are nature spirits inhabiting bodies constructed of plant matter fused together by a primal ritual.
