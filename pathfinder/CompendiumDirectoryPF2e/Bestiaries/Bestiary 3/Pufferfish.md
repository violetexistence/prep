The pufferfish defends itself by filling its flexible body with air or water to extend a number of spikes that otherwise lie flat against its skin. While normally quite slow and deliberate, the pufferfish can contort its body to gain a sudden burst of speed that can catch predators off guard.

Swimming in vast shoals through open ocean underneath the sparkling sun, lurking deep in the muddy beds of rivers, or schooling in pristine lakes, fish are found nearly anywhere there is water.
