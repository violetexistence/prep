They can move the probes all in separate directions using a single action.\n\nA hyakume can have no more than six eye probes active at a time; using this ability to create more causes the eye or eyes farthest away to shrivel and die.\n\nThe hyakume can deliver touch spells through their eye probes and can make melee spell attacks through them. In addition, the hyakume can Steal Memories through an eye probe using a single action by touching the target with the eye."

  - name: "Steal Memories"
    desc: "`pf2:3` (emotion,mental,occult) The hyakume reaches out with their mind and attempts to steal memories from a creature within 30 feet.\n\nThe target must succeed at a `DC 40 Will check` saving throw or become [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] and have some of its memories stolen. The hyakume learns some of the target's memories (chosen by the GM), which are then lost to the target."

Hundreds of bloodshot eyes peek out from under the fleshy layers of a hyakume's skin. These hulking aberrations covet knowledge and go to great lengths to keep what they know to themselves; they'll destroy scriptoriums they've raided and burn books they've read to ensure no other soul learns their contents. While hyakume occasionally trade valuable information to garner greater knowledge, they are liable to trick their targets into revealing more than they should. Most frightening of all is the hyakume's ability to steal memories and erase any knowledge of their existence from the minds of their victim
