It is an imprecise sense with a limited range (listed in the ability). Tremorsense functions only if the monster is on the same surface as the subject, and only if the subject is moving along (or burrowing through) the surface."

Cobble mites that remain a cohesive swarm for many years become dangerous living landslides.

Cobble mites resemble squarish stones a few inches across with mouths like split geodes. Though indolent and harmless alone, they're dangerous in large groups.
