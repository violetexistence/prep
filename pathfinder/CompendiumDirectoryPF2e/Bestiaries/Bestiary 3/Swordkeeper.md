    desc: "  A swordkeeper's torso houses a single weapon of a level no higher than the swordkeeper. While the swordkeeper is operational, the chamber requires four successful [[Actions/disable-device dc=32|disable-device dc=32]]{DC 32 Thievery} checks to [[Actions/Disable a Device|Disable a Device]] to open; on a critical failure, the backlash deals 6d6 force damage (`DC 30 Reflex check` save) to the creature attempting the check.\n\nIf the swordkeeper is [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]], [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]], [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]], or [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned]], both DCs are reduced by 2.\n\nIf the weapon is removed, the swordkeeper's echoblades vanish."

If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, the monster disrupts that action. This Strike doesn't count toward the monster's multiple attack penalty, and its multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike."

  - name: "Echoblade Flurry"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Frequency** once per round\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The swordkeeper makes two melee Echoblade Strikes. If both Strikes hit the same creature, combine their damage for the purpose of resistances and weakness. Apply the swordkeeper's multiple attack penalty normally."

  - name: "Project Echoblade"
    desc: "  **Requirements** The swordkeeper has a central weapon\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The swordkeeper projects an echoblade-a force copy of its central weapon that deals 1d8 force damage and gains thrown 30 feet. Echoblades inherit the weapon damage dice, weapon traits, and runes of the central weapon, but no other abilities or activations. The swordkeeper gains access to their critical specialization effects. The swordkeeper can have up to four echoblades at once; unattended echoblades vanish at the end of the swordkeeper's turn."

Collectors who want to guard their magical arsenals procure or build swordkeepers. These constructs are equal parts display case and security system, each holding a single weapon within its body and projecting copies of the weapon it stores to deter would-be thieves.
