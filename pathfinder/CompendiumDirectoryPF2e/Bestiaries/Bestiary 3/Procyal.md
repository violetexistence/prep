They can't transform into a generic member of a given ancestry.\n* * *\n\nThe monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

Afterwards, they become immune to this effect from all procyals."

These celestial outsiders hail from Nirvana, the plane of purest good. Agathions are born from the souls of mortals who attained the enlightenment they sought in life, sometimes even after death. Because they all start out as mortals who were rewarded for their determination, self-awareness, and purity of heart, agathions are more likely than other celestials to intervene in working nonviolently against the spread of evil on the material plane. Agathions have served as moderators between the chaotic azatas and lawful archons, so they know how vital communication with mortals can be to bridge differences and ensure that evil doesn't win out.

All agathions possess animal-like aspects, some appear more anthropomorphic, while others spend most of their time in forms nearly indistinguishable from true animals. Still others prefer to shapeshift as they see fit, or present as humanoid when in the company of humanoid mortals.

Each type of agathion serves a specific role in Nirvana. Their duties and forms generally reflect the core values they cultivated in life that led them to their enlightenment. Since agathions receive their animal forms as rewards for their mortal lives, they take great insult with insinuations that they're merely magical talking beasts or-even worse-that their forms are a curse or punishment.

* * *

As the most whimsical and playful of the agathions, procyals are the most likely to be encountered on the Material Plane, teaching deep philosophical lessons and delivering wisdom through pranks and impersonations. Mischievous and playful, these raccoon-headed humanoids love to socialize with mortals and learn about their societies. Unlike their mortal counterparts, Procyals' fur starts off dark russet in color, giving way to gray and white flecks on their muzzles as they grow older. Only procyal leaders boast the stark gray and black coloration of a true raccoon. Those who recognize procyals' age and wisdom treat these creatures with great respect.

Whatever their natural appearance, procyals make excellent shapeshifters and can assume the form of any humanoid that they've encountered. They use this ability only for the greater good of that humanoid or their community, often appearing as someone's trusted mentor to deliver an important message in a more laid-back fashion than talking to a magical celestial raccoon. They're not above playing the occasional harmless prank on the person whose form they've assumed, especially when they can use it to teach a valuable lesson. Raccoon agathions prefer to use a blade if forced into combat, but they're prepared to use their claws and fight dirty if necessary.
