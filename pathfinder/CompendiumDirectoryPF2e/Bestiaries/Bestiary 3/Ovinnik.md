The ovinnik doubles their fire resistance against this increased damage. The grain cloud dissipates after the first such effect or after 1 minute if no such effects occur."

The ovinnik is the most ferocious of house spirits, and the only one that will kill if sufficiently angered. They live in granaries, storage rooms, and sheds where food-particularly grain-is kept. Ovinniks resemble bipedal cats but bark like a dog to scare away thieves, and they often demand gifts of milk, pancakes, and dead roosters.

House spirits are shy, often helpful, sometimes wrathful fey that dwell alongside peasants and farmers. They reside in the house, in the yard, in the granary, in the bathhouse-wherever people build and live. Due to this proximity, house spirits often take on the mannerisms or appearance of nearby mortals. Their reclusive nature and tendency to go unseen earned them the moniker of "spirits," though in truth they are fully embodied fey.

House spirits take an almost parental interest in "their" mortals. Given proper respect, these fey work tirelessly for their charges-they chop wood, care for livestock, mend clothes, sweep the floor, and tend to the stove. If offended, though, the house spirit becomes a menace, frightening animals or children and ruining belongings.
