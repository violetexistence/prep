Beings of inscrutable intent and incredible power, dramofirs hail from the Dreamlands and shamble across the multiverse in search of dreams to incorporate into their voluminous robes. Few people on the Material Plane dare trifle with dramofirs and instead treat them with respect, hoping that they'll simply take their chosen victims' dreams and then go away. Often, this is exactly what happens. Every now and then, however, in the process of siphoning an individual's dreams, the dramofir slays their victim without warning or apparent cause.
