    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,divine,polymorph) The shaukeen takes on the appearance of a Small humanoid. This doesn't change the shaukeen's Speed or their attack and damage modifiers with their Strikes, but it might change the damage type their Strikes deal (typically to bludgeoning). The asura typically loses their jaws and thorn Strikes unless the humanoid form has fangs or a similar unarmed attack.\n\nThis alternate form has a specific, persistent appearance, which the shaukeen can change by performing a 1-hour ritual.\n* * *\n\nThe monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

Perhaps the most perverse asuras of them all, shaukeens particularly delight in causing the downfall of those who give them succor, shelter, and most of all, schooling. Many a teacher has come across a shaukeen disguised as a small child of exceptional talents or curiosity and taken them under their wing, only to be beguiled into ruin. This diminutive asura's cleverness is disproportionate to their size; they ask probing questions and coax their prey into decisions that lead to heresy, furthering the collapse of order and decency. When the world turns on the shaukeen's mentor, the asura is gone-but not very far, for they love hiding unseen and watching the torment and destruction of their mentors.

Asuras are, above all, proof that the gods are not infallible. These fiends arose as physical manifestations of divine accidents, taking form when the gods themselves stumbled and blasphemed on a cosmic scale. As a result of their own divine genesis, an asura loves above all to undo the workings of the divine. They eagerly travel to the Material Plane, seeking out temples, congregations of faithful worshippers, and religious orders of all stripes to sow doubt and destroy what the gods seek to build.
