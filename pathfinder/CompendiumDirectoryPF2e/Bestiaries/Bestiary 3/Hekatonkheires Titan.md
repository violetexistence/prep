The first three hekatonkheires were meant to guard the gates to the Abyss, but they proved too terrifying and rebellious-and so, in disgust, the gods cast them into the gulfs between the planes. Hekatonkheires titans are incomplete, monstrous progeny of the original three, from whom these titans calved like icebergs.

Hekatonkheires wield interstellar darkness as a weapon and spurn the limits of physical reality, literally reaching through space with their countless arms. Filled with a drive to either discover their lost identity or create their own, they metaphysically disembowel ancient beings and cosmic magics-using the entrails to find clues regarding their own nature and parentage or to serve as raw materials for fueling some alien apotheosis.

* * *

Created by ancient deities long before the rise of mortal ancestries, titans united and attempted to overthrow their deific progenitors. The resulting war still figures prominently throughout mortal myths, in which most titans were cast down and imprisoned for eons.
