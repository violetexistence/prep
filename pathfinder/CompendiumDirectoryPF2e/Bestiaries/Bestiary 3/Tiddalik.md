    desc: "  A creature can provoke a waterlogged tiddalik into laughing and releasing its stored water with a successful check to `DC 25 Performance check` a joke or funny story. The tiddalik also disgorges its water automatically if it dies while waterlogged, or can voluntarily Deluge as a three-action activity that has the concentrate trait. The mass of stored water swamps a 10-foot emanation, dealing 8d6 bludgeoning damage to creatures in the area (`DC 25 Reflex check` save) and making the area difficult terrain for 1 day. The tiddalik can't use its spit Strike or Expel Wave until it next Drinks in Abundance."

    desc: " (downtime) The tiddalik spends a day or more drinking from a water source. If the water source is equal to or greater in volume than itself, the tiddalik consumes 5,000 gallons of water per day and becomes waterlogged. While waterlogged, it can use its spit Strike, Expel Wave, and its Deluge ability, but its Speed is reduced to 10 feet. If the water source is smaller than the tiddalik, it consumes the water but does not become waterlogged."

    desc: "`pf2:2`  **Requirements** The tiddalik is waterlogged\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The tiddalik expels a wave of water in a 60-foot cone that deals 6d6 bludgeoning damage (`DC 25 Reflex check` save). Creatures that fail the save are pushed back 5 feet (10 feet on a critical failure).\n\nThe tiddalik can't use Expel Wave again for 1d4 rounds."

    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** The monster's last action was a successful Strike that lists Grab in its damage entry, or the monster has a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]\n* * *\n\n**Effect** If used after a Strike, the monster attempts to [[Actions/grapple|grapple]] the creature using the body part it attacked with. This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

Tiddaliks are giant, drought-causing monstrosities resembling grossly swollen frogs. They travel through the land, sniffing out water to gorge themselves on. Upon finding a source, the tiddalik submerges itself and begins to drink, and drink, and drink. Over time, it slurps the water down to the very last drop and balloons in size, becoming unable to move at more than an amble. The water sustains the tiddalik for years, while the land suffers a great drought. In fact, the only moisture to be found in any quantity might be the damp divot the tiddalik's great, sloshing body leaves behind as it travels.

Desperate locals trying to undo a tiddalik's work are met with the creature's gullet or torrents of water. A tiddalik is lazy and unlikely to start a fight of its own volition or even to chase a fleeing attacker, having little interest in anything but slaking its immense thirst. In its death throes, the tiddalik divulges its water stores, breaking free in a final tide of mass destruction that swamps the surrounding area. Woe betide any unlucky enough to find themselves beset by a tiddalik's gluttony!
