As deadly on land as in the water, kokogiaks are one of the most feared predators of the tundra. From a distance they might be mistaken for a frightfully large polar bear, but anyone unfortunate enough to see one up close will notice the creature's six additional legs and disturbingly elongated neck before meeting an untimely end. These ursine monstrosities stalk their prey tirelessly across ice and snow; they're also powerful swimmers, lurking under the ice to burst up and ambush unsuspecting creatures on the surface or diving for a marine meal.

As if numerous claws and a brutal bite weren't concerning enough, these nightmare-inducing creatures can be wickedly deceptive, luring their prey out in winter storms. The cunning kokogiak imitates the sounds of a creature in distress, deceiving its target into abandoning the safety of their shelter and embarking on an ill-fated rescue attempt. Those who live in arctic realms have learned to respond with caution upon hearing cries for help during a long winter night.
