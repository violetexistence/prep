Thanatotic titans served as assassins in the war against the deities. They learned to sever their targets' divine connections, murdering mortal priests and divine heralds alike. Thanatotic titans were locked away in the Abyss, but some have freed themselves and crept out from the Abyss so they might continue their sprees of murder and mayhem. To this day, they seek out the faithful for slaughter.

* * *

Created by ancient deities long before the rise of mortal ancestries, titans united and attempted to overthrow their deific progenitors. The resulting war still figures prominently throughout mortal myths, in which most titans were cast down and imprisoned for eons.
