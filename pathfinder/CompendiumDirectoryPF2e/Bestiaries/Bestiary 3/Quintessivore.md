The creature must either be captive or have been dead for no more than 2 hours before the start of the process. At the end of the hour, the quintessivore consumes the quintessence of the creature's soul.\n\nFor the next month, it gains a +1 status bonus to its spell DC and spell attack roll, and it adds 6th-rank [[Spells/Never Mind|Never Mind]] and [[Spells/Vampiric Exsanguination|Vampiric Exsanguination]] to its arcane prepared spells.\n\nDeconstructing a soul maps the unique properties of the creature's soul into the quintessivore's blade-legs. The soul can be reconstructed by binding it to quintessence. A dead quintessivore's soul flees its body as pure quintessence suitable for this purpose."

Quintessivores are cunning creatures that wield arcane magic and scalpel-sharp spider limbs that can rend one's soul just as easily as flesh. A quintessivore doesn't immediately kill its prey-it drags the creature to its lair and separates the victim's soul from their body with its bladed limbs. The flicking blades then pull out the creature's individuality, reducing the soul down to pure soul-stuff called quintessence, which the quintessivore then consumes.
