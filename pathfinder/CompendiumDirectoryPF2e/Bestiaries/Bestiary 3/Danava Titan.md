Danava titans once regulated the foundational forces that shaped reality. Rebuked by the gods for being harsh and inflexible overseers, these spurned titans joined their siblings in their failed war against their creators. Defeated, the danavas were cast into the paralyzing depths of the cosmos's seas. The few danava titans who have escaped now wield the cold, darkness, and crushing pressure of their prisons in pursuit of their ancient visions of reality. Danavas split mountains, wake primordial beasts, or level whole civilizations in accordance with grand designs they forged at the dawn of time. Others hunt and harvest the balance-enforcing aeons, who they see as usurpers of their divine responsibility.

* * *

Created by ancient deities long before the rise of mortal ancestries, titans united and attempted to overthrow their deific progenitors. The resulting war still figures prominently throughout mortal myths, in which most titans were cast down and imprisoned for eons.
