Plague giants are rasping behemoths, whose weeping sores, fetid breath, and filthy fingernails all bear a terrible wasting disease. Like sewer rats or flies that swarm a fresh battlefield, plague giants bear an inborn pathogen that does little harm to the giants themselves (their wretched physical appearances are purely superficial) but can wreak devastation on afflicted victims.

Whatever their origin, the majority of plague giants are so accustomed to being viewed as monstrosities by other humanoids, giant and otherwise, that they become vehemently xenophobic. Some of their communities do permit other types of shunned humanoids-especially those with leprosy and other stigmatized diseases-to join their fold. Whether because they are expelled to the world's worst badlands or because they purposefully seek out such locales, plague giants often settle amid abandoned battlefields, sewer outlets, and other despoiled places. Their close ties to disease lead many to worship Apollyon, the Horseman of Pestilence, or other deities associated with disease. Plague giants claim that their kind is as death itself, violently rejecting the theory often touted among non-giants that they are an offshoot of some other giant ancestry afflicted with a terrible divine curse. (Most other giants also reject this theory.)

Plague giants measure 24 feet tall and weigh 15,000 pounds.

Many kinds of giants lurk in the inhospitable corners of the world, making their homes in unlikely locales ranging from fetid sinkholes and ruined battlefields to mass graveyards and barren badlands.
