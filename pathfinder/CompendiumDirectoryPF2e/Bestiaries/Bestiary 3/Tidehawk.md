    desc: "  This sense allows a monster to feel vibrations caused by movement through a liquid. It's an imprecise sense with a limited range (listed in the ability). Wavesense functions only if monster and the subject are in the same body of liquid, and only if the subject is moving through the liquid."

    desc: "  This monster regains the listed number of Hit Points each round at the beginning of its turn. Its [[Conditions/Dying|Dying]] condition never increases beyond Dying 3 as long as its regeneration is active. However, if it takes damage of a type listed in the regeneration entry, its regeneration deactivates until the end of its next turn. Deactivate the regeneration before applying any damage of a listed type, since that damage might kill the monster by bringing it to Dying 4."

  - name: "Self-Resurrection"
    desc: " (healing,primal) When a tidehawk dies, it melts into a torrent of rainwater. If this rain falls into a body of water, such as an ocean or lake, the tidehawk returns to life fully healed 1d4 rounds later, as if subject to a 6th-rank [[Spells/Resurrect|Resurrect]] ritual. Self-resurrection happens only if there are remains to resurrect; for instance, a tidehawk killed by a [[Spells/Disintegrate|Disintegrate]] spell can't use this ability. A tidehawk that dies while above land must wait until its rainwater runs or seeps into an appropriate body of water to self-resurrect. A tidehawk can self-resurrect only once per year."

The tidehawk gains a +2 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of its next turn. If the tidehawk takes damage from a melee Strike while under this effect, this water armor explodes outward, dealing 4d8 bludgeoning damage (`DC 32 Reflex check` save) to the attacking creature and ending the circumstance bonus to AC.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Oceanic Armor|Effect: Oceanic Armor]]"

The area becomes difficult terrain until the start of the tidehawk's next turn while the water surges and runs off."

Tidehawks, avian embodiments of the sea and rain, nest in deep underwater crevasses and glide among waves. They feed mostly on large sea life and rise above the surface during or in the aftermath of a rainstorm to bask in the fresh moisture of the air.

Though tidehawks hail from the same mystical family as the legendary phoenix, the two rarely interact due to their different outlooks and elemental affiliations. Phoenixes see tidehawks as flighty and unreliable, while tidehawks view their fiery kin as self-righteous do-gooders who can't resist meddling in mortal affairs. Only particularly evil threats to natural environments can bring them together.
