The alien entities known as rhu-chaliks serve as scouts for a conglomeration of deep-space conquerors called the Dominion of the Black. Their masters use them as spies, tasking them with harvesting the thoughts and memories of sentient creatures into a vast repository of knowledge designed to eventually unravel every secret of existence.

Also called void wanderers, rhu-chaliks can survive the depths of space indefinitely. They are extremely long-lived and capable of traversing the vastness of space between worlds. Rhu-chaliks prefer to work alone in order to reduce potential overlap in their mind predations. The furtive beings are calculating and infinitely patient, seeking only the most exceptional minds to cast beyond the stars to their masters.
