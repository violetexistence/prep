If the puppet dies, its body remains under the control of the incutilis until it's destroyed or the incutilis Abandons the Puppet. If the puppet recovers from the dying condition, the incutilis immediately Abandons the Puppet.\n\nWhile controlling a puppet, the incutilis is attached to the puppet's head (or elsewhere, if its brain is in an unconventional location) and moves along with it. The puppet uses its own AC, Hit Points, Fortitude and Reflex saves, and physical Strikes, but it uses the incutilis's Will save. The puppet can perform only basic actions and untrained uses of the Athletics and Stealth skills while controlled.\n\nAny attack that deals damage to the puppet also deals 1 mental damage to the incutilis. Area effects are applied to both the incutilis and puppet. The incutilis always has lesser cover while in control of a puppet.\n* * *\n\n[[Other Effects/Effect_ Cover|Effect: Cover]]"

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

Incutilises are intelligent, nautilus-like sea creatures that attack their victims' brains to take over their bodies, creating puppets to use for labor, combat, or their own malevolent amusement.

An adult incutilis is slightly smaller than an adult human head. Its shell bears a pattern of crimson streaks that resemble the ridges and furrows of a brain. Incutilises hatch within the depths of the sea, where they start off consuming bottom-dwelling crustaceans and sometimes even whales or sharks, but as they grow into adults, incutilises instinctively crave the complex tissues of other creatures' brains-the more complex, the better.

An incutilis makes excursions onto land specifically to use their iconic puppetmaster ability. They use their tentacles to crawl up onto shore or climb aboard a ship. An incutilis then drives their tendrils directly into the brain of a helpless living (or very recently dead) land creature, taking control of it through this neurological connection. They prefer to target humanoids and animals. This host-now called a puppet-rarely survives the experience.

After the incutilis has taken full control, they can usually ride their puppet for as long as they wish. Often, they use the puppet to seek out other potential prey, battling other creatures until the wear and tear from repeated conflict renders the body useless.
