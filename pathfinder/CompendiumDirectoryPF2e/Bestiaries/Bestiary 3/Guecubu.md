Sometimes an individual performs acts of horror so unspeakable that the earth they walk on becomes imprinted by their evil. With such villains, even slaying them and scattering their bones can't rid the world of their vile presence. Their souls rise again as guecubus, gruesome skeletons made of scorched bones, rotting flesh, and befouled earth. Guecubus roams the land seeking those they deem responsible for their death.

A guecubu remembers what was done to them, and the memories of their supposed mistreatment fuel their quest for revenge. Guecubus are well-equipped to exact such vengeance. Along with monstrous power and the ability to move through earth, they retain all the cunning they had in life. These creatures are known to kill their enemies one by one, leaving no trace of their presence behind save pebbles and dust.
