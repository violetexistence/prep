    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,polymorph,primal) The seaweed leshy transforms into a Small patch of seaweed. This ability otherwise uses the effects of [[Spells/One with Plants|One with Plants]].\n* * *\n\nThe monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

Calmer than most of their other botanical brethren, seaweed leshys are a tranquil, discerning breed of leshy. They seek to mimic the ocean in their attitudes, moving with the waves of life and accepting what comes and goes while acknowledging the good and the bad.

Seaweed leshys make their homes in tidal pools surrounded by other sea creatures. They believe their freshwater counterparts to be sheltered and naive, living in their secluded ponds and babbling brooks, though this doesn't stop them from forming friendships with freshwater leshys.

Seaweed leshys vary in size, shape, and physical makeup. While the majority of seaweed leshys reach about 2 feet in height, some remain as small bundles of strands that stand about 6 to 8 inches tall.

Often found assisting practitioners of nature magic, leshys are sentient flora that protect the natural world and sacred spaces within forests, fields, and other environments. Leshys are nature spirits inhabiting bodies constructed of plant matter fused together by a primal ritual.
