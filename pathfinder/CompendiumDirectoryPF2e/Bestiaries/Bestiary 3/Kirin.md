The rare and majestic antlered beast known as a kirin supposedly appear only in times of peace and prosperity or during the birth or death of a great sage. Thus, encountering a kirin is a sign of great fortune, success, and prosperity to come. Conversely, finding a kirin's corpse or witnessing their death is a portent of tragedy and misfortune. A kirin's song always precedes the sighting of one of these graceful creatures, a sound often mistaken for wind chimes gently dancing in the breeze.

Kirin are chimeric creatures with the body of a stag, the tail of an ox, two horns atop their heads, and the scales and vibrant coloration of a dragon. Their majestic manes and beards constantly flow in the breeze, even on days with no wind, and sometimes appear wreathed in flames.

As creatures that treasure life, kirin don't consume flesh, and they take great care not to kill even a single insect beneath their cloven hooves. They're the embodiment of peace yet will quickly strike down evil with a powerful thrust of their horns, knowing that their acts preserve the peace for those who might otherwise come to harm. Legends tell of particularly pious champions who have persuaded kirin to partner with them as mounts, though accomplishing such a feat is even rarer than the kirin.
