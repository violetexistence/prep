Nykteras, or bat sprites, are gentle sprites known for their affectionate nature and incredible hospitality. Nykteras share features with bats, but the type of bat varies by location, as nykteras tend to form small colonies in locations with bats similar to their own nature. A nyktera's sense of hospitality is such that they're willing to share with any who need it, even bitter foes. However, violating a nyktera's hospitality is one of their greatest taboos, inviting rare anger and retribution from the nyktera who was wronged, as well as their large extended family.

Tiny winged fey with intense curiosity and adventurous spirits, sprites often find themselves in risky situations and shenanigans belying their stature. While their pixie and grig cousins are most common, numerous additional types of sprites were born from the faerie realm of the First World. These include draxies, melixies, and nykteras, each of which shares commonalities with a different animal or magical creature.
