A betobeto-san wanders the highways and byways of the Material Plane, searching for unwilling traveling companions to sustain the spirit's appetite for fear. Though this shadow spirit is invisible in darkness or shade, in light they appear as a formless, shadowy mass with two sandaled feet. These sandals are made of wood or bone that cause the creature's footsteps to make the distinct "beto beto" sound from which they receive their name. A wide, toothy mouth smiles in the middle of their otherwise featureless mass, and they can manifest long, clawed limbs.

Betobeto-san trail behind nighttime travelers, compelled to follow until the creatures verbally offer to let the betobeto-san pass. This compulsion isn't usually malicious by nature and occurs more from a betobeto-san's misguided desire for company and courtesy; unfortunately, they lack of understanding how this behavior can frighten others. Betobeto-san don't attack those they follow, but they often end up in combat because their unwelcome behavior causes those they follow to attack first.
