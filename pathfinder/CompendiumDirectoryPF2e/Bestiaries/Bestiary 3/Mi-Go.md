This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

Mi-gos are both scientists and colonists, yet their extraterrestrial nature and malevolent motives color their investigations with cruelty. While their shape resembles that of an arthropod, mi-gos are in fact a highly evolved and intelligent fungus.

In mi-go society, the pursuit of secular knowledge and religious epiphany have no distinction and inspire their pursuits in tandem. They view the Outer Gods and Great Old Ones of the Elder Mythos less as gods to obey and more as muses or figures of inspiration. This results in their use of a strange blend of magic and technology to create bizarre, organic items that are grown and spliced together as much as crafted in the traditional sense.

A mi-go can survive in the void of outer space and flies through the vacuum at incredible speeds-though these journeys can take months within a single solar system and years to travel beyond. When they come to new planets to mine resources rare on their home worlds, they use clever disguises that mix technology and magic to appear as creatures of that world. While there, they select the greatest minds of that world as trophies, extracting their brains and preserving them within an eldritch cylinder that grants an awful immortality to the mind kept within.
