A kuchisake-onna, or slit-mouthed woman, is a tall, masked figure who moves with an eerie grace. These horrors are infamous for trapping hapless mortals and asking them, "Am I pretty?" A "no" response leads to a gruesome death wrought by the silver scissors the kuchisake-onna carries. A "yes" prompts them to remove their mask, revealing the scars and cuts running from ear to ear, giving the impression of a terrible, ever-present grin. They then open their mouth to reveal sharp, needle-like teeth and ask another question: "Even now?" A "no" leads to the same gory death, while a "yes" prompts them to use their silver scissors and make the same cuts on the target's face while repeating: "Then I will make you like me."

There are a handful of methods to weasel out of this otherwise no-win scenario. Answering noncommittally, saying the kuchisake-onna looks "okay," or throwing several small, countable objects like rice or candy often provides enough time to run while the monster is distracted. Few are foolish enough to attack the kuchisake-onna, and those that live to tell the tale speak of a flashing flurry of scissor blades that match even a swordmaster's prowess.
