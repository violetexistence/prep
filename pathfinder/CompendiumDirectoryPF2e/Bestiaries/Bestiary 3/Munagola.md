Munagolas are some of the most feared demonic warriors in Hell, combining the aerial strength and craftiness of erinyes with sheer brute force rivaling that of the strongest devils.

There are countless legions of lawful fiends in the nine layers of Hell, warring against the celestial planes and scouring the Material Plane for souls to corrupt.
