Mix couatls (pronounced "meesh") are guides to fledgling societies, providing fundamental information such as farming techniques, medicinal expertise, or more esoteric knowledge like the arcane arts.

Couatls are serpentine celestials who tirelessly help mortals reach their greatest potential all across the planes. Some serve benevolent deities as intermediaries while others serve the cause of good as they see fit.
