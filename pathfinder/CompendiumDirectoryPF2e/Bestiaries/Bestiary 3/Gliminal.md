The damage has the same type and still applies the gliminal's immunities, resistances, and weaknesses.\n\nThe link remains until the target is more than 120 feet away, the gliminal falls unconscious, or the gliminal uses Bond in Light again.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Bond in Light|Effect: Bond in Light]]"

  - name: "Overpowering Healing"
    desc: " (primal,vitality) When a gliminal grants vitality healing that would heal a living creature above their maximum Hit Points, including the fast healing HP from their Bond in Light ability, the excess is granted as temporary Hit Points.\n\nUnlike normal, these temporary HP combine with each other, and they last for 1 hour. If a creature's temporary HP from a gliminal ever exceeds its maximum HP, it becomes overloaded and explodes in a burst of vitality energy.\n\nA creature with temporary HP from overpowering healing becomes [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]], or [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]] if the temporary HP equal half their maximum HP or more. The creature can't reduce this sickened condition unless it has 0 temporary HP.\n\nOverpowering healing doesn't apply to creatures with the vitality trait."

Beholding the blinding light of a gliminal is akin to staring into the sun, and consequently, only gliminals themselves fully understand what they are or how they truly look. Gliminals exude a constant aura of vitality energy, suffusing everything they encounter without regard for whether a creature's body can withstand these excesses of vitality energy.

On the Forge of Creation they call home, gliminals view outsiders as unfortunate creatures afflicted with the malady called mortality. They seek to suffuse mortals with light and healing until they no longer suffer, and they consider those who explode into vitality energy cured. Gliminals pulled to other planes, whether summoned or through interplanar rifts, find themselves overwhelmed, and usually lash out in increasingly desperate attempts to escape the oppressive onslaught of matter and negative energies.
