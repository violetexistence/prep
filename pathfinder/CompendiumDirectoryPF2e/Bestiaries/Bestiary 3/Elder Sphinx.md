The GM either runs the riddle out of character by timing the players' attempts, or picks an appropriate associated skill for the riddle, such as Religion for a riddle involving divine mysteries.\n\nThe sphinx gains a +2 circumstance bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls against any creature that answers incorrectly even once. This bonus lasts for 1 day.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected, but it can choose to try to help solve the riddle.\n\n**Success** The creature attempts to answer the riddle, each round spending at least one action attempting a [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] check with the chosen skill (or working on the answer, if using an out of game riddle). This lasts for 1 minute, until the creature successfully answers the riddle, or until an enemy takes a hostile action against the creature, whichever comes first.\n\n**Failure** As success but the creature must spend at least two actions each round attempting to answer.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but up to 1 hour."

Towering over their kin, elder sphinxes are the pharaonic masters of their kind. They crave solitude in eternal vigil over sacred spaces, where they honor ancient pacts.

Sphinxes are a family of mystical beings that combine leonine, avian, and usually humanoid features. Though the most common sphinxes are famous on their own merits, the family includes other types of sphinxes as well.
