The mutant attempts an Athletics check to [[Actions/grapple|grapple]] all creatures within 10 feet. The mutant's multiple attack penalty doesn't increase until it has made all the Athletics checks that are part of its Grasping Hands. Creatures that are grabbed are pulled to a space adjacent to the mutant. This is forced movement."

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."
