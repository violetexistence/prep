    desc: "Each dragon pillar that is destroyed removes the corresponding color's effect from Dahak's shell; as long as even one color remains active, the pillars marking the shell's border cannot be damaged themselves, but a successful `DC 32 Thievery check` (master) check or a successful [[Spells/Dispel Magic|Dispel Magic]] (6th rank; counteract DC 30) against one of the eight pillars can cause a randomly determined active color in the shell defense (below) to become deactivated for 1d4 rounds."

These effects are the same as that of the eye beams. Each effect requires its own save."

While a target is controlled, it is treated as a Cinderclaw ally by the dragon pillar. The dragon pillar can control up to 3 targets at a time; any targets in excess who critically fail this saving throw are instead confused for 1d4+1 rounds. A controlled creature can attempt a new Will save once every 24 hours to escape control, but doing so automatically causes the dragon pillar to attack it with a new eye beam to attempt to re-establish control. The control ends if the pillar is destroyed."
