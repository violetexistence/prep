    desc: "  You can use clever workarounds to replicate the arcane essence of certain materials. When Casting a Spell that requires material components, you can provide these material components without a spell component pouch by drawing intricate replacement sigils in the air. Unlike when providing somatic components, you still must have a hand completely free. This doesn't remove the need for any materials listed in the spell's cost entry."

    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,spellshape) You can extend the range of your spells. If the next action you use is to [[Actions/Cast a Spell|Cast a Spell]] that has a range, increase that spell's range by 30 feet. As is standard for increasing spell ranges, if the spell normally has a range of touch, you extend its range to 30 feet."
