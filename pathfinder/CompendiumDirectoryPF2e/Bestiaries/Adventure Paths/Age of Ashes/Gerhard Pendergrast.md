    desc: "`pf2:2`  Gerhard fires an explosive shot from his blunderbuss that deals 4d6 bludgeoning damage plus 2d10 fire damage to all creatures in a 30-foot cone (`DC 26 Reflex check`).\n\nWhen firing the blunderbuss, Gerhard must succeed at a `DC 20 Crafting check` or Engineering Lore check or the weapon explodes, damaging him for the same amount as the creatures in the cone and destroying itself. If someone other than Gerhard uses the weapon, they must critically succeed at the check. A successful `DC 22 Crafting check` check is enough to confirm the weapon's unstable nature if someone examines it beforehand.\n\nReloading the blunderbuss takes 3 Interact actions: adding 1 dose of gunpowder, adding 1 grapeshot canister, and packing the contents."

    desc: "`pf2:2` (move) **Requirement** Gerhard is in a jungle, dense forest, or an area with numerous overhead beams.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Gerhard uses his whip to lash upward to wrap around an overhanging tree branch; he then swings up to 30 feet in a straight line, and must end the movement on solid ground or fall."
