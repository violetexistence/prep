Kalavakuses work as slavers in the Abyss, earning them the alternate moniker of "slaver demons"; these fiends round up captured victims and sell them to other fiends or unscrupulous mortals. Pleas for freedom or clemency fall on deaf ears, as slaver demons consider anyone they can catch and hold to be their rightful property and theirs to sell. Kalavakuses know more than just physical means of restraining slaves; they also know how to fetter a victim's soul. The most successful slaver demons have vast slave-pits in the Abyss where they keep stables of imprisoned souls.
