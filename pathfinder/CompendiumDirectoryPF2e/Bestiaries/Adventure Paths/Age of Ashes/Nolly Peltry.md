Nolly can have up to 10 members in her crop at once; any member added in excess of this number automatically removes a crop member of Nolly's choice. When Nolly or a member of her crop [[Actions/Aid|Aids]] a crop member and rolls a success, they get a critical success to Aid instead.\n\nWhen a crop member within 60 feet of Nolly fails a saving throw against an effect that would impose the [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]] or [[Conditions/Paralyzed|Paralyzed]] condition, the crop member can use a reaction to reroll the saving throw and use the better of the two results. This is a fortune effect."
