If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, the monster disrupts that action.

    desc: "`pf2:r`  **Trigger** A creature within Uri's reach fails an attack roll, saving throw, or skill check\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Uri makes an unarmed Strike against the triggering creature. If the attack hits, the target must succeed at a `DC 41 Fortitude check` save or become [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 3]] until the end of its next turn ([[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 4]] on a critical failure)."

    desc: "`pf2:2`  Uri makes two Strikes: one with his scimitar and one with his shield spikes. If both hit, the overwhelming power of the attack leaves the target [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]] ([[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 2]] if one of the Strikes was a critical hit, or [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 3]] if both Strikes were critical hits). These Strikes count as one attack for Uri's multiple attack penalty, and the penalty doesn't increase until after both attacks."

If Uri succeeds at an attack roll with a +36 modifier against the target's AC, he applies the [[Equipment/Manacles (Superior)|Manacles]]."
