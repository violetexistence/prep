    desc: "`DC 40 Religion check` (legendary) to call out to a non-evil deity for direct intervention to disperse the lesser dragonstorm (prayers to Apsu allow characters who are masters in Religion to attempt the check as if they were legendary instead), `DC 42 Thievery check` (legendary) to deactivate Vengegate while the manifestation is forcing it open, or a successful [[Spells/Dispel Magic|Dispel Magic]] (10th rank; DC 40) to counteract the lesser dragonstorm."

  - name: "Routine"
    desc: "(1 action) On its initiative, the lesser dragonstorm reaches out and blasts all creatures within Alseta's Ring. Affected creatures take 10d8 damage (`DC 46 Reflex check`), evenly split between acid, cold, fire, electricity, and poison. Creatures that fail their save are pulled 20 feet toward the center of Alseta's Ring (or are knocked prone and pulled 30 feet on a critical failure). After 10 rounds, the lesser dragonstorm is destroyed, but a much greater dragonstorm manifests in the surrounding region-see The Dragonstorm."
