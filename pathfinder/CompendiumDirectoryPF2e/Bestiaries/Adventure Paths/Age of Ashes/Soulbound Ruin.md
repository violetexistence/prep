    desc: "  The ruin can spend 10 minutes repairing itself to regain up to 30 healing Hit Points. If the ruin is interrupted during this time, it loses its focus and the repair fails.\n\nThis ability functions even if the ruin is reduced to 0 HP, unless a [[Spells/Consecrate|Consecrate]] ritual has been performed to purify the building, in which case the soulbound ruin is destroyed. This ritual must be dedicated to a good deity or a deity with a strong opposition to undead, such as Pharasma."

Those who tread in ruined places sometimes speak of a sense that a supernatural presence is there alongside them, as if the spirits of the dead were watching intently. Such presences can be very real, often taking the form of ghosts or other shades of undead that cannot let go of their attachment to the Material Plane. But sometimes, instead of manifesting as distinct spirits, the souls of the dead infuse the very stone and mortar around them. When enough souls attach themselves to a single place-be it a home, crypt, or castle-it can take on a life of its own, becoming a soulbound ruin.
