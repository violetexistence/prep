  - name: "Staff Mastery"
    desc: "`pf2:2`  Although Hezle does not cast spells, her obsession with fire and long hours of practice allow her to cast spells from her _staff of fire_ as if she had the spells on her spell list and could cast them. She still must expend charges from the staff normally; when she prepares the staff each morning, she is capable of placing 4 charges in the staff."
