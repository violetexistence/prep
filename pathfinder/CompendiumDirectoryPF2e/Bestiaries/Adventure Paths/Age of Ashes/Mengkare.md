    desc: "`pf2:2` (arcane,fire) Mengkare breathes in one of two ways. He can't use Breath Weapon again for 1d4 rounds.\n\n*   **Flame** (arcane,evocation,fire); Mengkare breathes a blast of flame in a 80-foot cone that deals 24d6 fire damage (`DC 46 Reflex check` save).\n*   **Weakening Gas** (arcane,necromancy); The dragon breathes a blast of weakening gas. Each creature within a 30-foot cone must succeed at a `DC 46 Fortitude check` save or become [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 4]] for 1 minute (or [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 5]] on a critical failure)."

  - name: "[[Creature Family Ability Glossary/(Dragon) Change Shape|Change Shape]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (arcane,concentrate,polymorph) Mengkare assumes a Medium humanoid form, posing as the human wizard Lamond Breachton.\n* * *\n\nThe dragon takes on the appearance of any Small or Medium humanoid. This doesn't change its Speed or attack and damage bonuses with its Strikes, but might change the damage type its Strikes deal (typically to bludgeoning).\n* * *\n\nThe monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

  - name: "Explosive Breath"
    desc: "  When Mengkare uses Breath Weapon, he can expel an explosive orb of flame instead of a cone. When he does, he fires the orb at the corner of a square within 60 feet. The orb immediately detonates and deals 24d6 fire damage (`DC 48 Reflex check` save) to all creatures within a 30-foot burst. Creatures that critically fail their save catch on fire and take 4d6 persistent fire damage."
