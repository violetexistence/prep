    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,occult,polymorph) Ishti can take on the appearance of a Medium humanoid. This doesn't change her Speed or her attack and damage modifiers with her Strikes, but it does prevent them from using her cursed touch. Ishti has a fixed humanoid form-they cannot adopt a different appearance each time they use this ability, and the appearance resembles that of their upper torso when in their true form.\n* * *\n\nThe monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

This condition value decreases by 1 every 24 hours."
