    desc: "`pf2:r`  A Promise Guard can use Attack of Opportunity when a creature within her reach uses a concentrate action, in addition to its normal trigger. They can disrupt triggering concentrate actions, and they disrupt actions on any hit, not just a critical hit.\n* * *\n\n**Trigger** A creature within the monster's reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The monster attempts a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, the monster disrupts that action. This Strike doesn't count toward the monster's multiple attack penalty, and its multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike."

The shield prevents the monster from taking an amount of damage up to the shield's Hardness. The monster and the shield each take any remaining damage, possibly breaking or destroying the shield."

    desc: "`pf2:2`  The Promise guard makes a Strike with their longsword, then attempts to push the target back. If the Strike hits, the target is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the start of the guard's next turn, and the guard can automatically Shove the target, with the same benefits as the Shove action (including the critical success effect if the Strike was a critical hit). If the guard moves to follow the target, this movement doesn't trigger reactions. In addition, if the target has to stop moving because it would hit an object, it takes damage equal to the guard's Strength modifier."

    desc: "`pf2:2`  The Promise guard Strides up to double their Speed. If the guard ends their movement within melee reach of at least one enemy, they can make a melee Strike against that enemy."
