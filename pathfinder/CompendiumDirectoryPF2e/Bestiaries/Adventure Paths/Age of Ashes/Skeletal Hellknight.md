  - name: "Invoke Reckoning"
    desc: "`pf2:r` (divine,mental) **Trigger** The skeletal Hellknight hits a foe with a Strike.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The skeletal Hellknight causes the creature struck to endure the pain of an Order of the Nail's reckoning-a rite of mortification Hellknights of that order use to focus their minds. The creature struck feels as if nails are being driven into their body, and must succeed at a `DC 17 Will check` save or be [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]] from the pain. On a critical failure, the pain manifests as actual puncture wounds, dealing an additional 2d6 piercing damage to the victim."
