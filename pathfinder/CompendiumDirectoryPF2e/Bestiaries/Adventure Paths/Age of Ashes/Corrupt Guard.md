    desc: "`pf2:2`  A corrupt guard can dash their foe to the ground with a single blow. They attempt a single melee Strike. If this Strike hits, they also apply the critical success effect of a Trip. If they used a two- handed melee weapon (such as a maul) for the Strike, they can use the weapon's damage die size instead of the regular die size for the damage from a critical Trip, and they ignore Trip's requirement to have a hand free."
