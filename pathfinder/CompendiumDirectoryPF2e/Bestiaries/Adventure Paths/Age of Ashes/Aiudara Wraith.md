Dahak's influence in Alseta's Landing created a soul-draining effect that slays unprotected creatures within, transforming them into ghostly creatures known as aiudara wraiths, but these rare undead can rise within modern aiudara portals as well. Each time an individual travels through an aiudara, there's a chance their passage could leave a faint imprint of their subconscious in the network. Normally this imprint simply fades away, but when an aiudara is damaged or the individual is suffering from necromantic contagions, these imprints can accumulate and, in time, coalesce on the Astral Plane or within Alseta's Landing as a full-fledged aiudara wraith. The wraith is forced to live with an incomplete sense of self, always seeking its own memories and swiftly growing violent and vengeful as its quest to reclaim these ephemeral notions constantly meets with failure.
