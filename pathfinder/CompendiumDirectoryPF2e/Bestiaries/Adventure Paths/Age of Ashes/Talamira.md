    desc: " (divine) Talamira's ghost is bound to the way station by the presence of the wailing crystals; if this hazard is deactivated or destroyed, Talamira sighs in relief as her memories are restored-this burst of psychic energy suffuses all PCs in the area, granting them access to the ancient tradition of magic she once followed, that of the crystal keeper archetype. A moment later, Talamira fades away, her soul moving on to the afterlife.\n* * *\n\nWhen a ghost is destroyed, it re-forms after 2d4 days within the location it's bound to, fully healed. A ghost can be permanently destroyed only if someone determines the reason for its existence and sets right whatever prevents the spirit from resting."

If the creature is already slowed 1 by crushing despair, it is [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 2]] as long as it's under both effects simultaneously.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature is also [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 3]] from its overwhelming sadness."
