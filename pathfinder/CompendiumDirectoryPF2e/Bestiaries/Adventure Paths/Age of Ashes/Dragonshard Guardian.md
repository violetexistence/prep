Its body reverberates and transforms the absorbed energy before projecting it outward in a 60-foot burst.\n\nEach creature within the burst takes an amount of fire damage equal to the amount of energy damage absorbed by the triggering attack, including any damage resisted by the guardian's resistances and additional damage from its weakness (`DC 45 Reflex check` save).\n\nThis fire damage doesn't harm objects or constructs."
