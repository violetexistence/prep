    desc: "`pf2:2`  The precentor adds a creature that is affected by its Tormenting Touch and is within 100 feet to its choir of screams. A precentor can have any number of creatures in its choir, although a creature no longer affected by Tormenting Touch leaves the choir immediately. Creatures in a precentor's choir of screams are [[Conditions/Fascinated|Fascinated]] by each other and the precentor, and they can't use hostile actions toward each other or the precentor. When the precentor casts an innate divine spell, it can cause the effect to originate from any member of its choir instead of itself, using the precentor's saving throw DC and attack bonus."

After attempting this save, the creature is then temporarily immune until the start of the precentor's next turn."

  - name: "Tormenting Touch"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (divine,emotion,mental) The precentor touches a creature within 10 feet, causing it to constantly scream in agony. The target must attempt a `DC 38 Will check` save.\n\nWhile the target is stupefied by this effect, its continual screams cause it to automatically fail Stealth checks.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The target is [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]].\n\n**Failure** The target is [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 3]].\n\n**Critical Failure** The target is [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 4]].\n\nThe target can attempt a new Will save at the start of each of its turns, reducing the stupefied condition by 1 on each successful save. If the target reduces its stupefied condition to 0 in this way, the target is no longer affected."

Velstracs are horrific, shadow-dwelling fiends who seek ultimate sensation through self-mutilation. They transcend their stoic detachment only when inflicting pain and terror upon their victims, practicing new forms of debasement and torture before then turning their knives on themselves. Although velstracs consider themselves beyond such limitations as morality or mortal taboos, their victims know them as emotionless tormentors who inflict debased, sadistic suffering. They claim to seek perfection in thought, form, and action, although they don't recognize any refinement that doesn't require the painful excision of the flesh or spirit.

Velstracs manifest from the souls of masochistic or sadistic mortals that are diverted into the Shadow Plane and then forged into forms that suit their vile predilections, ranging from the low-ranking augurs to the aesthetics-obsessed interlocutors.

Some mortals refer to velstracs as "kytons," a misattribution that the velstracs tolerate with cold amusement. The term "kyton" denotes a master or virtuoso among their kind, and these fiends enjoy being labeled masters of their horrid paths to perfection through agony.

Velstrac storytellers and historians are known as precentors. Trailed by horrific choirs, precentors perform in the courts of the velstrac demagogues.
