The creature must attempt a `DC 28 Reflex check` saving throw.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature takes full damage and is [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]].\n\n**Failure** The creature takes double damage and is [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 2]].\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, plus the creature's blood causes fresh growth. A new 10-foot-square patch of lifeleech crystals grows in an adjacent space to the current patch of crystals."
