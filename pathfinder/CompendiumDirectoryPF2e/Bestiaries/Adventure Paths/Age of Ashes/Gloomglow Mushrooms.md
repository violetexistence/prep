    desc: "`pf2:r` **Trigger** A creature moves into the mushrooms' space or damages the mushrooms. The mushrooms can't use this reaction if the damage was cold damage.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The triggering creature and all creatures within 10 feet are sprayed with itchy, distracting, glowing spores and must attempt a `DC 22 Reflex check` save. On a failed save, the creatures become [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] and [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] (or [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]] and [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] on a critical failure) and take a -4 penalty to Stealth checks until the spores lose potency in 24 hours or are removed. This requires washing them off by bathing in water for a minute, a [[Spells/Prestidigitation|Prestidigitation]] spell, or a similar measure allowed by the GM.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Glowing Spores|Effect: Glowing Spores]]"
