Though the Silver Ravens defeated the evil tyrant Barzillai Thrune before he could fully realize his goal of becoming a genius loci, remnants of his spirit remain throughout the Ravounel region. On occasion, these scraps of sentience form a vague, Barzillai-shaped body from bits of the nearby terrain, but when near haunted locations, the spectral force can coalesce into a more precise body using ectoplasm siphoned from these haunts. In either form, the remnant carries a form of Barzillai's own burning mace, which dissolves into a thin mist 1 hour after the remnant is destroyed.

Remnants of Barzillai can manifest anywhere throughout Ravounel, and even after one remnant is defeated, another might arise later on. The undead inquisitor can be put to rest permanently only by retrieving his mace before it disappears, then burying it in a location consecrated by good clerics, where it must remain for at least a year undisturbed.

While a remnant of Barzillai can draw power from any haunt it is associated with, remnants tend to do so with specific haunts. The haunts presented are commonly associated with remnants of Barzillai. These are far from the only haunts Barzillai can create, however; the Silver Ravens' records mention many phenomena associated with the undead being, some of which deal with themes of various birds, the scents of mint and tea, and ghostly figures in heavy armor.
