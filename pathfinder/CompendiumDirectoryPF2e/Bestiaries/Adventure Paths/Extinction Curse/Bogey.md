A bogey typically hunts a single creature at a time, usually a small child or elderly person, methodically stalking and tormenting their prey. Often hiding under a bed, amid a dark attic space, or in a closet left slightly ajar, the bogey delights in the slow, methodical cultivation of fear in its victims.

Bogeymen are stealers of innocence and devourers of souls. Few targets who survive an encounter with them remain unchanged. Different names are given to bogeymen according to their varying sizes and degrees of power, which typically advance as the monsters consume more souls.
