These nocturnal stalkers tail their chosen quarry for days, even weeks at a time, ominously showing up in back alleys, shadowy street corners, and even in victims' own homes before going in for the kill. For unfathomable reasons, a bogeyman may spare a victim's life and instead kidnap them, absconding to a far-off location before returning years later with a fresh bogey in tow.

Bogeymen are stealers of innocence and devourers of souls. Few targets who survive an encounter with them remain unchanged. Different names are given to bogeymen according to their varying sizes and degrees of power, which typically advance as the monsters consume more souls.
