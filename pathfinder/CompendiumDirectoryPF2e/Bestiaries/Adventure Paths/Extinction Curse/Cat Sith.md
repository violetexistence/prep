If the target is a dying creature, it must attempt a `DC 25 Fortitude check` save; on a failure, its dying value increases by 1 (or 2 on a critical failure). If the target is dead, it receives no save and its soul is imprisoned in the cat sith's body, becoming freed only if the cat sith is slain. While the soul is imprisoned, the creature can't be brought back to life by any means short of a [[Spells/Wish|Wish]] or [[Spells/Miracle|Miracle]]. The cat sith can hold only one soul at a time and can release a soul as a free action."

Cat siths can easily pass for common black house cats, noteworthy only for the white spots on their chests and their unusually bristly personalities. In actuality, they are cunning fey, fully capable of speech, trickery, and even walking upright on their hind legs and using their forepaws almost as skillfully as hands. Cat siths live around highland towns and cities, regularly venturing unnoticed into nearby communities by posing as domesticated felines or using magic to take humanoid form. While some cat siths gather information and undertake tasks for more powerful fey creatures, others serve only their own mysterious agendas.

Cat siths are harbingers of misfortune and find amusement in the unluckiness that follows in their wake. Though they are rarely malicious, they are fascinated by death in all its forms, and may go so far as to steal the souls of the dying for some inscrutable purpose.
