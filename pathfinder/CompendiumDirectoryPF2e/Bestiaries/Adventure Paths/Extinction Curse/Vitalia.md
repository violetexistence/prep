This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

Foul occult magic, rare alchemical reagents, and copious amounts of spilled blood are the keys to creating a vitalia-also known as a heart horror-though thankfully the exact means of their creation has been long forgotten.

Now, most vitalias now come into being by sheer accident. This unusual life-form cannot live without regular contact with blood, much like how fish cannot live long outside of water. Because of this, vitalias are rarely found outside the lairs of mad alchemists or wizards, living in pools of the life-giving substance. Physically, a vitalia somewhat resembles a blood-red giant jellyfish, though it also bears some semblance to a giant human heart.
