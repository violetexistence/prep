After devouring enough souls, a bogey transforms into the more powerful and sophisticated bugaboo.

Bogeymen are stealers of innocence and devourers of souls. Few targets who survive an encounter with them remain unchanged. Different names are given to bogeymen according to their varying sizes and degrees of power, which typically advance as the monsters consume more souls.
