    desc: "`pf2:1` (occult,possession) Lyrt possesses an object of size Large or smaller within 20 feet, making it an animated object. This animated object's level can be no higher than Lyrt's level -2. If the target object is being held by a creature, the bearer can attempt a `DC 34 Will check` save to prevent the possession.\n\nThis possession ends when the object is destroyed or Lyrt leaves it. At this point, Lyrt reappears in the object's square and can't Inhabit an Object again for 1d4 rounds.\n\n_Note: A DC was not provided for this ability by Paizo. The DC present here is a moderate DC for the creature level according to the Gamemastery Guide creature building Tables._"

  - name: "[[Creature Family Ability Glossary/(Ghost) Malevolent Possession|Malevolent Possession]]"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (incapacitation,mental,occult,possession) Lyrt attempts to possess an adjacent corporeal creature. This has the same effect as the [[Spells/Possession|Possession]] spell with an unlimited duration, except since Lyrt doesn't have a physical body, it is unaffected by that restriction.\n\nWhen Lyrt departs, the target has only confused and incoherent memories of the period during which they were possessed. If a creature dies while possessed by Lyrt and its corpse remains intact, Lyrt can immediately inhabit the corpse (see Inhabit Body) as a reaction, in which case the corpse acts like an animated object."
