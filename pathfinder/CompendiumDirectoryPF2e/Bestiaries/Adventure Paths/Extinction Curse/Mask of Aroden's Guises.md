    desc: "(3 actions) An unmasked statue casts [[Spells/Phantasmal Killer|Phantasmal Killer]] (`DC 27 Will check` and `DC 27 Fortitude check`) against a target in the room for each of the trap's actions, creating an image of the statue lunging forth. It doesn't affect the same creature more than once; if there are fewer targets than it has actions, the trap doesn't use its remaining actions. Unmasking an additional statue increases the hazard's actions by 1, and replacing a mask reduces its actions by 1."
