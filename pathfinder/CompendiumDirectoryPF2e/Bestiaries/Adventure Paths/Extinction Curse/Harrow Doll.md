A creature can be cursed with only one effect from harrowing misfortune at a time, with a new curse overriding any previous curse. The curse ends after 1 minute or after the specified roll is made, whichever comes first. The suits and their effects are: Hammers (melee attack roll), Keys (Reflex save), Shields (Fortitude save), Books (skill check), Stars (Will save), and Crowns (spell attack roll).\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Harrowing Misfortune|Effect: Harrowing Misfortune]]"

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

Harrow dolls are unique constructs that can make predictions about the future. The more elite circuses and traveling shows frequently feature a harrow doll, and many use the doll's abilities to learn more about locals to better customize shows to their tastes-or to find easy marks for later cons. Upset patrons that try to harm a harrow doll or reclaim their payment quickly learn that the construct is more than capable of defending itself.
