    desc: "`pf2:r`  Dyzallin can use Attack of Opportunity when a creature within his reach uses a concentrate action, in addition to the usual trigger. He can disrupt triggering concentrate actions, and he disrupts actions with a successful attack roll, not just a critical success.\n* * *\n\n**Trigger** A creature within the monster's reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The monster attempts a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, the monster disrupts that action. This Strike doesn't count toward the monster's multiple attack penalty, and its multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike."
