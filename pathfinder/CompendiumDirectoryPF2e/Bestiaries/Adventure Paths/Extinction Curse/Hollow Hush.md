    desc: "  Tremorsense allows a monster to feel the vibrations through a solid surface caused by movement. It is an imprecise sense with a limited range (listed in the ability). Tremorsense functions only if the monster is on the same surface as the subject, and only if the subject is moving along (or burrowing through) the surface."

The target must succeed at a `DC 41 Will check` save or take 5d10 mental damage and be [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned]] for 1 round. If the target fails its saving throw, Hollow Hush regains the same number of Hit Points and Feed on Emotion does not cost Hollow Hush an action, allowing it to use another action this turn."

  - name: "Spiral of Despair"
    desc: " (emotion,mental) **Trigger** A creature fails a saving throw to resist one of Hollow Hush's innate spells or emotional focus spells\n* * *\n\n**Effect** As Hollow Hush invades the triggering creature's mind and plants the seeds of negative emotions, it also strips away the target's feelings of hope or positivity. Hollow Hush can immediately end a single emotion effect from which the triggering creature is benefiting."
