    desc: " (illusion) The brughadatch conjures a decadent, enticing feast void of nutritional substance. This conjuration takes 1 minute and lasts for 24 hours. For each item of illusory food a creature eats, it must attempt a `DC 29 Will check` save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature sees through the illusion and becomes immune to the effects of Deceitful Feast for 24 hours.\n\n**Success** The creature doesn't see through the illusion but is unaffected by the food.\n\n**Failure** The creature takes a -1 circumstance penalty to Will saves against any of the brughadatch's spells or abilities. The penalty increases with each failed save, to a maximum of -5.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, plus for 1 hour, the creature's attitude becomes helpful to the brughadatch, and the creature can't use hostile actions against them.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Deceitful Feast (Failure)|Effect: Deceitful Feast (Failure)]]"

They target up to five creatures within 30 feet and feast on their ambient brainpower, dealing 4d10 mental damage (`DC 26 Will check` save) to each creature. Unless a target succeeds at the Will save, this damage does not end the [[Spells/Charm|Charm]] effect or the effect of Deceitful Feast as a hostile action normally would."

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

The biggest difference between a gahlepod and a grown brughadatch isn't their humanoid appearance, but the powerful magic they gain as they mature.

* * *

Brughadatches are malevolent fey tricksters with distinct stages of life: they spawn from the First World's primal energies as esurient tadpoles, grow into humanoids capable of creating enticing illusions, then finally evolve into huge, slothful toads that warp their environs with mere thoughts.
