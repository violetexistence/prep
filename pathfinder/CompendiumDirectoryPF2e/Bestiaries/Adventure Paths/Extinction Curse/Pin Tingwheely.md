    desc: "`pf2:1` (manipulate) Pin sprinkles pixie dust onto one of his arrows. If Pin hits a creature with that arrow before his next turn, the arrow inflicts one of the following special effects instead of dealing damage. Each effect depends on the target's `DC 26 Will check` save. On a critical hit, the target treats its save result as one degree worse.\n\n*   **Befuddlement** (enchantment, mental) On a failed Will save, the target is [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] for 1 minute ([[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] on a critical failure).\n*   **Charm** (emotion, enchantment, incapacitation, mental) The target suffers the result of a 4th-rank [[Spells/Charm|Charm]] spell, except it doesn't gain a bonus to its save if the only hostile act was Pin firing his bow, and Pin can choose to direct the target's adoration to another creature rather than himself.\n*   **Memory Loss** (divination, mental) On a failed Will save, the target loses the last 5 minutes of its memory. Pin can add a single false memory if he chooses, which is the only memory the target retains in that time period.\n*   **Reckless Pride** (emotion, enchantment, mental) The target suffers the result of [[Spells/Delusional Pride|Delusional Pride]]."
