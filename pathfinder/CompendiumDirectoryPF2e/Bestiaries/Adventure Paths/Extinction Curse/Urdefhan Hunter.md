If the jaws Strike was a critical hit, the creature suffers both effects, using the same save result for both.\n\n*   **Drain Blood** The urdefhan drinks some of the creature's blood. On a failed save, the creature is [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]] and the urdefhan regains 5 healing HP (or, on a critical failure, it's [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 2]] and the urdefhan regains 10 healing HP).\n*   **Drain Vitality** (necromancy) The urdefhan draws out some of the creature's vital essence. The creature becomes [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]] for 1 hour on a failed save (or [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 2]] for 1 hour on a critical failure)."

Urdefhan hunters serve as their cults' trappers, hunters, and poachers. Many urdefhan hunters use skavelings to traverse the massive caverns of the Darklands and scout for prey.

* * *

Urdefhans believe themselves to be spawn of the First Horseman of the Apocalypse, who planted them on the Material Plane to serve as harbingers of the end times. These warmongering humanoids live in groups called cults in the Darklands vaults of Orv.
