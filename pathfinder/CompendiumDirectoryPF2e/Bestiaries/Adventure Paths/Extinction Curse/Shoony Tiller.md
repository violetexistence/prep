    desc: "`pf2:2` (manipulate) **Requirements** You are standing on dirt, sand, snow, or similar particulate material.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Your hands work as effectively as shovels when you need to dig a quick hole. You dig a shallow pit in the square you currently occupy, turning the square into difficult terrain (including for you). In addition, you also kick up a cloud of grit in a direction of your choice. The cloud extinguishes small, unattended, non-magical fires and helps smother the flames on burning creatures located within the cone; creatures in this cone that are taking [[Conditions/Persistent Damage|Persistent Fire Damage]] can immediately attempt an additional `DC 15 Flat check` to end the persistent damage."

Nearly all shoonies in a given settlement are farmers, fishers, or foragers. Shoonies are not expected to fight to protect their settlements; most agree it is better to live in cowardice than to die with that foolish, intangible principle taller races call "honor." Many shoonies hone their skill with tools rather than arms in the knowledge that whatever is lost to violence can be rebuilt. When cornered, a shoony may put up a fight with whatever they have on hand; the average shoony can wield a simple shovel or pick in melee as well as most humans can wield a sword.

Shoonies are reclusive humanoids who resemble bipedal dogs with wrinkled faces and bulging eyes. They predominantly dwell in the grasslands and hilly plains of the Isle of Kortos. Shoony societies on Kortos are known for their agricultural prowess, industrious work ethic, and skill with tools to shape their environment.

Shoonies have a rich oral history and claim that their kind flourished all around Kortos in the days when the living god Aroden walked among them. Many shoonies believe that Aroden himself personally created the shoonies after he raised the island from the bottom of the sea, and that he had a deep affinity for their people. Whether or not such tales of companionship with the god of humanity are true, shoonies have drastically declined in numbers since Aroden's death over a hundred years ago. Shoony elders point to strange environmental phenomena around their island home as one cause of their diminishment, and others attribute their decline to the rise of warmongering monsters in the area. In a world where might often makes right, it is hardly a surprise that the peaceful but timid shoonies are becoming increasingly rare.
