These exceptions are listed in shortened form in the golem's stat block, with the full rules appearing here. If an entry lists multiple types (such as \"cold and water\"), either type of spell can affect the golem.\n\n*   **Harmed By** Any magic of this type that targets the golem causes it to take the listed amount of damage (this damage has no type) instead of the usual effect. If the golem starts its turn in an area of magic of this type or is affected by a persistent effect of the appropriate type, it takes the damage listed in the parenthetical.\n*   **Healed By** Any magic of this type that targets the golem makes the golem lose the slowed condition and gain HP equal to half the damage the spell would have dealt. If the golem starts its turn in an area of this type of magic, it gains the HP listed in the parenthetical.\n*   **Slowed By** Any magic of this type that targets the golem causes it to be [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] for 2d6 rounds instead of the usual effect. If the golem starts its turn in an area of this type of magic, it's slowed 1 for that round.\n*   **Vulnerable To** Each golem is vulnerable to one or more specific spells, with the effects described in its stat block."

Traditionally, clay golems are crafted in the image of a deity and used as guardians of tombs or sacred crypts. Clay golems have the power to lay curses upon their victims as punishment for intrusion, leading many to believe that these oft-ancient constructs have a touch of the divine to them. While this idea has little basis in reality, superstitious folk still tread lightly around statues that resemble clay golems even in the slightest.

The animating force within a clay golem is unusually unstable, making the golem prone to entering a berserk frenzy when damaged. Entire treasuries have been totally ruined as a result of a rampaging clay golem, so crafters do well to make sure their golems are maintained and in good working order-or otherwise place them on the other side of the door from the treasures they wish to protect.
