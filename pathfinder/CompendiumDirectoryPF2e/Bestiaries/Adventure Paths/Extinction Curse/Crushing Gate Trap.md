    desc: "`pf2:r` (attack) **Trigger** The stone rod is moved or either door is touched\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The two falling doors deal 6d12+35 bludgeoning damage (`DC 37 Reflex check` save) to all creatures within 15 feet of the gate. On a failure, a creature is also pinned beneath the door and [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] until the door is moved (`DC 34 Athletics check`) or destroyed; each door has the same AC, Fortitude save, Hardness, and Hit Points as the trap itself. On a critical failure, the creature is trapped in such a way that it can't attempt to free itself. Moving or destroying one door doesn't help free anyone trapped by the other door."
