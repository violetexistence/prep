Mhar, an ancient evil deity of caverns, mountains, and volcanoes, belongs to the pantheon of the Great Old Ones-monstrous beings of alien intellect and unfathomable power. The so-called children of Mhar (known as deghuuns in the chaotic tongues of Mhar's enraptured cultists) physically resemble blue-gray octopods made of stone, mud, and molten iron. Venthole-like craters dot the surface of a deghuun's body, through which the creature can gaze out with a single golden eye that it can move from crater to crater.
