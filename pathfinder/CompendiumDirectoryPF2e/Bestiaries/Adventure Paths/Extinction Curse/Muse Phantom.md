    desc: " (aura,emotion,mental,occult) 30 feet. The muse phantom inspires a supernatural emotional response-either comedy or drama. Each creature that begins its turn in the aura must attempt a `DC 20 Will check` save; on a failure, the creature is affected as long as it remains within the aura. If the muse phantom is emitting a comedic aura, affected creatures become [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]]; if it is emitting a dramatic aura, affected creatures instead become [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]].\n\nThe muse phantom can change its aura from comedic to dramatic or vice-versa, or cease or activate this aura, by spending a single action, which has the concentrate trait. A creature possessed by a muse phantom is immune to this aura."

  - name: "Muse Possession"
    desc: "`pf2:2`  The phantom muse attempts to possess an adjacent corporeal creature. This has the same effect as the [[Spells/Possession|Possession]] spell (`DC 20 Will check`), except the duration is 1d4 hours, and since the phantom muse doesn't have a physical body, it is unaffected by that restriction of the spell. If the target is at least trained in Performance, the DC of this ability is `DC 24 Will check`."

For performers who die before their time and whose love of the theater is stronger than death's grasp, the show does indeed go on. Such actors rise from the grave to become muse phantoms-undead spirits that haunt opera houses or auditoriums and possess the bodies of living actors to continue their art.

A host is often utterly unaware of being possessed by a muse phantom. Like egotistical parasites, muse phantoms assume command of their unwitting thespian shells only during big shows with packed audiences, and even then the host might chalk up their sudden lack of control to the transcendence of performance, not the nefarious influence of some paranormal entity. In time, a performer's mind can become utterly warped by the spirit's domination, twisting artistic temperament and vanity into evil selfishness and tireless obsession.
