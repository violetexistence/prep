    desc: " (rage) **Trigger** Kharostan's turn begins and he has 140 or fewer Hit Points\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Kharostan throws caution to the wind to finish the fight. He gains a +2 status bonus to attack rolls, a -2 status penalty to AC, and a -1 status penalty to saves. He can also make a Wicked Bite each time he damages a creature with his jaws Strike, in addition to the usual once per round usage for a free action.

  - name: "Wicked Bite"
    desc: "  **Trigger** Kharostan damages a creature with a jaws Strike\n\n**Frequency** once per round\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Kharostan's bite leaves the victim's flesh translucent around the site of the injury.

On a failed save, the victim is [[Conditions/Doomed|Doomed 1]] and [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]], and Kharostan regains 20 healing HP (on a critical failure, the creature is [[Conditions/Doomed|Doomed 2]] and [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 2]], and Kharostan regains 40 healing HP).\n*   **Drain Vitality** (necromancy) Kharostan draws out some of the creature's vital essence. The creature becomes [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 2]] for 1 hour on a failed save (or [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 3]] for 1 hour on a critical failure)."
