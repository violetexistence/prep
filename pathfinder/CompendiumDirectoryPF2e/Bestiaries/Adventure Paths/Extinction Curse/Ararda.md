The aura is blocked by lead sheeting, 1 foot of stone, or large force effects (such as a [[Spells/Wall of Force|Wall of Force]], but not a [[Spells/Shield|Shield]] spell).\n\nAn ararda can suppress their aura with an action (`pf2:1`) that has the concentrate trait."

    desc: "`pf2:1` (arcane,concentrate,polymorph) The ararda can take on the form of a scorpion. The scorpion form always looks the same, but the ararda can choose to become either Tiny or Small in this form. This transformation doesn't change their Speed or the attack and damage bonuses of their Strikes, but might change the damage type their Strikes deal (typically to piercing).\n* * *\n\nThe monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

Before the Black Desert became a barren sandscape, cultures with grand magical traditions lived under its soaring roof. These communities eventually left the vault or died out, but the genies they summoned remained and became warped by the region's pervasive blightburn radiation. Now, these "blightburn genies" have bodies with features mirroring those of beasts that dwell in dark places, and their elemental lineages have been irreparably corrupted.

* * *

Shaitans corrupted by the Black Desert's blightburn become scorpion-like arardas. While other earth genies sparkle with the iridescence of gemstones and evoke the power of the earth itself, arardas use their connection to the ground to harness the might of electricity. Arardas are so infused with this radioactive crystal that their mere presence is toxic to most living creatures.
