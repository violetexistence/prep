    desc: "`pf2:1` (arcane,concentrate,polymorph) The muurfeli can take on the form of an owl. The owl form always looks the same, but the muurfeli can choose to become either Tiny or Small in this form. This transformation doesn't change their Speed or the attack and damage bonuses of their Strikes, but might change the damage type their Strikes deal (typically to slashing).\n* * *\n\nThe monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

Whereas typical djinn can cleanse or clear areas with their arcane winds, the air magic of muurfeli is tainted by the Black Desert's noxious radiation and mixed with the realm's ambient fetid winds.

* * *

Before the Black Desert became a barren sandscape, cultures with grand magical traditions lived under its soaring roof. These communities eventually left the vault or died out, but the genies they summoned remained and became warped by the region's pervasive blightburn radiation. Now, these "blightburn genies" have bodies with features mirroring those of beasts that dwell in dark places, and their elemental lineages have been irreparably corrupted.
