On a success, the faceless butcher deals damage as if they had made a successful cleaver Strike against the creature and removes the creature's face. On a critical success, the damage doubles and the creature takes 4d6 bleed. Once its face is removed, the creature takes a permanent -4 status penalty to Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks.

The deformed flesh on this humanoid horror's head bears grim holes where their eyes, nose, mouth, and ears should be, and little else. Stories of faceless butchers always center on the monstrous murderer's preferred weapon: a wicked and bloodstained meat cleaver, which the butcher uses to carve flesh from skull to add to their collection of stolen faces. Once they've taken a victim's face, the faceless butcher can wear it, transform into an exact replica of the deceased, and begin stalking their next victim.
