    desc: "  The Shoony Hierarch's blunt snout and labyrinthine sinus system make it resistant to phenomena that assail the nose. When it rolls a saving throw against inhaled threats (such as inhaled poisons) and olfactory effects (such as xulgath stench), the outcome is one degree of success better than the result of its roll."

    desc: "  You hail from shoonies who have lived long and successfully among the reeds and cattails of swamps and marshes, and have adapted to the challenges of living near waterlogged ares. You ignore difficult terrain and greater difficult terrain from bogs. When you roll a success to [[Actions/Swim|Swim]], you get a critical success instead."

  - name: "Signal Arrow"
    desc: "`pf2:2`  The shoony hierarch sparks and launches an alchemically treated arrow that creates a bright light high in the sky. A signal arrow cannot be used to deal damage. Hierarchs carry a number of different arrows that signal different things; a red signal arrow might mean retreat, whereas a green arrow might be a call to gather in the village commons."

For all their advancement in agriculture, horticulture, and animal husbandry, shoonies subscribe to a remarkably antiquated form of leadership; the role of hierarch is normally inherited, passed on to the oldest living child of the village's previous hierarch. In the instance that the village's hierarch does not produce an heir, the village holds a general election. Elected hierarchs hold the term for life and are just as highly regarded as hierarchs raised from birth. When the settlement comes under attack, it is up to the hierarch to decide when to fight and when to flee. In most cases, shoonies prefer to elect individuals with a preference toward the latter.
