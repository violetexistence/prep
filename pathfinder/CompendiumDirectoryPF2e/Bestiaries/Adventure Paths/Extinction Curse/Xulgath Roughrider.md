The roughrider must succeed at a `DC 5 Flat check` check or they fall off their mount and land [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]].

While within the aura, the creature takes a -2 circumstance penalty to saves to recover from the sickened condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune to all xulgaths' stenches for 1 minute."

The mount and the xulgath each retain 3 actions on their turns, but the mount doesn't change its general tactics until the xulgath uses Feral Directive or Command an Animal again."
