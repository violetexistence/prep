Xulgath physiological diversity doesn't always imply drastic change; some xulgaths are simply much larger and stronger than their clutchmates. Most xulgaths call such siblings spinesnappers, though terms like bonebreaker, marrowvent, or similarly violent epithets are equally common. A typical spinesnapper is 9 feet tall and weighs 350 pounds.

In battle, spinesnappers have all the speed, grace, and strength of a sledgehammer. They are ideal shock troops and make a good first line of defense. When an inter-clutch conflict leads to a duel, spinesnappers are typically called upon to rise to the challenge. In this case, a spinesnapper representative from each clutch squares off for what is in theory a nonlethal wrestling match, after which the winner scrapes off some of the loser's scales as a trophy.
