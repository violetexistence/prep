    desc: "(1 action) The mirror absorbs another reflected creature into the mirror (`DC 42 Reflex check`) and replaces it with a mirror duplicate. Mirror duplicates act on their own initiative, using the same statistics as the original creature, but with an evil alignment (changing only abilities that shift with the alignment change).\n\nMirror duplicates are legendary in Intimidation and are permanently [[Conditions/Quickened|Quickened]], but they can use this additional action only to Demoralize.\n\nA mirror duplicate can spend 3 actions in contact with the mirror to return to its original dimension and release the creature it duplicated, but most mirror duplicates prefer not to."
  - name: "Reset"
    desc: "The mirror is always ready to absorb creatures into another dimension. 10 minutes after a creature is sucked into the mirror, if an ally doesn't rescue the creature using the Thievery skill, the creature reaches the mirror dimension, where it could be captured or killed. In the mirror dimension, it counts as a mirror duplicate, so the denizens of the other dimension can't destroy the mirror on their side while the absorbed creature is there. These dimensions are alternate realities, not planes, so even rituals like [[Spells/Interplanar Teleport|Interplanar Teleport]] can't reach them."
