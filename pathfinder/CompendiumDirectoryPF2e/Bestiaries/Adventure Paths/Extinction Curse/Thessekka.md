Any creature grappled or restrained by her becomes [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]]; to get free, the creature must damage the statue enough to break it or succeed at a `DC 36 Acrobatics check` check to [[Actions/Escape|Escape]]. The only action Thessekka can take while petrified is to use Stone Throes again to end the effect."

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."
