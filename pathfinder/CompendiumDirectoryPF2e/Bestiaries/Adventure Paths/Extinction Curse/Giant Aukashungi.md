  - name: "Flippable"
    desc: "  When flipped on its back, a giant aukashungi can't move and its soft underbelly becomes exposed. Whenever a creature critically succeeds at a melee attack roll to Strike a giant aukashungi, the attacking creature can forgo the bonus damage to flip over the giant aukashungi (all other critical hit effects apply normally, such as critical specialization effects). While flipped over, the giant aukashungi can't use reactions, can't Stride or Strike, takes a -2 circumstance penalty to AC and saving throws, loses its resistances, and gains weakness 10 to physical damage. The aukashungi can right itself by using the Roll Up activity and then using an action to unroll."

Each creature that starts its turn in the area takes 10d8 acid damage plus 2d8 persistent acid damage (`DC 32 Fortitude check` save). The gas moves 10 feet away from the giant aukashungi each round and lasts for 1 minute. The giant aukashungi can't use Acidic Effluence again for 1 minute."

  - name: "Roll Up"
    desc: "`pf2:2`  The aukashungi protects its soft underbelly by rolling into a tight ball. The aukashungi gains a +2 circumstance bonus to AC while Rolled Up, but it cannot Stride or Strike, and it rolls downhill if on a slope. If the aukashungi is grappling a creature when it Rolls Up, that creature must succeed at a `DC 35 Fortitude check` save or become Swallowed Whole.\n\nThe aukashungi can unroll with a single action (this action has the move trait)."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Swallow Whole|Swallow Whole]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (attack) Large, 15d6+6 bludgeoning, Rupture 27\n* * *\n\nThe monster attempts to swallow a creature of the listed size or smaller that it has grabbed or restrained in its jaws or mouth. If a swallowed creature is of the maximum size listed, the monster can't use Swallow Whole again. If the creature is smaller than the maximum, the monster can usually swallow more creatures; the GM determines the maximum. The monster attempts an `Athletics check` check opposed by the grabbed creature's Reflex DC. If it succeeds, it swallows the creature. The monster's mouth or jaws no longer grab a creature it has swallowed, so the monster is free to use them to Strike or Grab once again. The monster can't attack creatures it has swallowed.\n\nA swallowed creature is [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]], is [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]], and has to hold its breath or start suffocating. The swallowed creature takes the listed amount of damage when first swallowed and at the end of each of its turns while it's swallowed. If the victim [[Actions/Escape|Escapes]] this ability's grabbed condition, it exits through the monster's mouth. This frees any other creature grabbed in the monster's mouth or jaws. A swallowed creature can attack the monster that has swallowed it, but only with unarmed attacks or with weapons of light Bulk or less. The swallowing creature is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] against the attack. If the monster takes piercing or slashing damage equaling or exceeding the listed Rupture value from a single attack or spell, the swallowed creature cuts itself free. A creature that gets free by either Escaping or cutting itself free can immediately breathe and exits the swallowing monster's space.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Engulf and Swallow Whole|Effect: Engulf and Swallow Whole]]\n\nIf the monster dies, a swallowed creature can be freed by creatures adjacent to the corpse if they spend a combined total of 3 actions cutting the monster open with a weapon or unarmed attack that deals piercing or slashing damage."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Improved Grab|Improved Grab]]"
    desc: "  **Requirements** The monster's last action was a successful Strike that lists Improved Grab in its damage entry, or the monster has a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]\n* * *\n\n**Effect** If used after a Strike, the monster attempts to [[Actions/grapple|grapple]] the creature using the body part it attacked with as a free action. This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead spend an action to use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

The strongest individual in an aukashungi swarm eventually grows to monstrous proportions.

These massive isopods are native to the Abyssal realm of Gluttondark, in the acidic oceans of the realm's many cavern-worlds. Aukashungis are sometimes summoned to the Material Plane by Zevgavizeb-worshipping cultists, who favor aukashungis for their mindless obedience and sheer destructive potential.
