This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

Xilvireks are the result of the strange evolution that takes place in Zevgavizeb's Abyssal realm. These fiends resemble their dread demon lord and claim to be living embodiments of the Lord of Reptiles's snapping jaws.
