    desc: " (incapacitation,poison) A creature damaged by a resin-seep xulgath's jaws or claw Strike must succeed at a `DC 28 Reflex check` save or be covered with clumps of noxious resin, taking 2d8 poison damage and a -15-foot penalty to its Speeds for 1 minute (on a critical failure, the creature is also [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] for 1 minute). The creature is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] for as long it has a Speed penalty. A creature can spend an [[Actions/Interact|Interact]] action to scrape the resin off, decreasing the Speed penalty by 5 with each such action."

The resin-seep xulgath can't use Resin Spray again for 1d4 rounds."
