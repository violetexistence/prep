On a success, the vanish man deals damage as if they had made a successful cleaver Strike against the creature and removes the creature's face. On a critical success, the damage doubles and the creature takes 4d6 bleed. Once its face is removed, the creature takes a permanent -4 status penalty to Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks.
