    desc: "`pf2:r`  Tentacle only\n* * *\n\n**Trigger** A creature within the monster's reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The monster attempts a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, the monster disrupts that action. This Strike doesn't count toward the monster's multiple attack penalty, and its multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike."

  - name: "Echoes of Aeons"
    desc: "  At the start of Sarvel's turn, if he is dead, unconscious, or otherwise unable to act, his efforts in the unfinished _extinction curse_ ritual pull on the power of an _aeon orb_.\n\nThe surge of power heals his body completely without causing the wounded condition, causes him to grow an additional tentacle, and attempts to counteract all detrimental effects on Sarvel as a 10th-rank effect with a +42 counteract modifier.\n\nAn aeon orb used by Sarvel or the heroes is depleted and can't be used to power this ability."

  - name: "Enraging Stench"
    desc: " (aura,emotion,mental,olfactory) 30 feet. A creature that enters or begins their turn in the emanation must attempt a `DC 45 Fortitude check` save. On a failure, the creature is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]] and [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]] for 1 round; on a critical failure, it can't target Sarvel with any Strikes or other effects from its confused condition.\n\nWhile within the emanation, the creature takes a -2 penalty to saves to recover from the sickened condition.\n\nA creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune to all xulgaths' stenches for 1 minute. Sarvel can suppress or resume this aura as a free action."

  - name: "Touch of Zevgavizeb"
    desc: "  Sarvel begins combat with two tentacles. Each tentacle has 66 HP and is immune to area damage.\n\nA creature can attempt to sever one of Sarvel's tentacles by specifically targeting it and dealing damage equal to the tentacle's Hit Points. A tentacle not completely severed returns to full HP at the end of any creature's turn.\n\nFor each tentacle he has, Sarvel gains an extra reaction at the start of his turn that can be used only for an Attack of Opportunity. If he has no tentacles, he can no longer make tentacle Strikes, Writhe Independently, or Constrict."
