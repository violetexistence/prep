    desc: "  The Shoony Militia Member's blunt snout and labyrinthine sinus system make it resistant to phenomena that assail the nose. When it rolls a saving throw against inhaled threats (such as inhaled poisons) and olfactory effects (such as xulgath stench), the outcome is one degree of success better than the result of its roll."

If shoonies had their way, war would cease to exist altogether, but they know this isn't likely. Shoonies' relative wealth of resources and their frailty compared to other humanoids make them a common target of violence and subjugation. Because of this, basic combat training is typically mandatory for all shoony village members. Few individuals pursue lifelong careers in service to their settlement's militia, however. The passing down of a sword from one shoony soldier to another is a time-honored tradition, owing to the rarity of weapons in shoony society.
