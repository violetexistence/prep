    desc: "passive Once each turn after it has taken a move action within the maze, each target in the maze can spend 1 action to attempt a `DC 26 Perception check` or `DC 26 Survival check` check to escape it. A group traveling the maze together is treated as a single target; no more than one creature in the group can attempt this check each round, but accompanying creatures can Aid this check. The possible outcomes follow. A target attempting to leave the maze the same way it entered uses the outcome for one degree of success better than the result of its roll when attempting this check (failure to success, for example).\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target escapes the maze.\n\n**Success** The target is on the right path to the exit. If the target was already on the right path, it escapes the maze.\n\n**Failure** The target makes no progress toward escape.\n\n**Critical Failure** The target makes no progress toward escape, and if it was on the right path, it no longer is."

    desc: "(3 actions) The trap uses its first action to magically shuffle the mirrors, rendering markings or maps of the maze ineffective. Creatures in the maze that fail a `DC 26 Will check` save are [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] until they leave the maze. If the target fails additional saves against this ability, the condition value increases by 1 (to a maximum of [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 4]]).\n\nFor its second action, the trap's ghostly minotaur attacks a random creature in the maze with its spectral gore.\n\nFor its third action, the trap makes another spectral gore attack against a random creature."
