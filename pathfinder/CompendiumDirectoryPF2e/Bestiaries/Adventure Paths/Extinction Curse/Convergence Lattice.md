    desc: "`DC 40 Thievery check` (master) or `DC 35 Religion check` (master) four times to obliterate each of the four key runes.\n\nA `DC 45 Thievery check` (legendary) check (or breaking the lattice) stops the clockwork's movement and prevents it from resetting, but doesn't stop its current activation."

    desc: "(3 actions) The _convergence lattice_ uses its first action to call for aid. Each convergent creature within 100 feet of the lattice Strides toward the lattice as a reaction. Creatures thus called continue to move toward the lattice on their turn each round until they are adjacent to it, at which point they defend it with their lives.\n\nThe lattice uses its second action to deal 16d6 mental damage (`DC 42 Will check` save) to a non-convergent creature within 100 feet. This damage is nonlethal; a creature knocked out by this damage doesn't gain the dying condition and is automatically [[Conditions/Controlled|Controlled]] by the convergence lattice when they awaken.\n\nThe lattice uses its third action to make the same attack against a second non-convergent creature within 100 feet; if there isn't such a second creature, it doesn't take its third action."
  - name: "Reset"
    desc: "The _convergence lattice_ deactivates and resets after there are no uncontrolled targets within line of sight for 1 minute."
