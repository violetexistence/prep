    desc: "  As a brainchild formed from a legendary villain defeated by the PCs, Nemesis possesses two unique abilities, one chosen from the defensive abilities and one from the offensive abilities listed above. As long as the PCs exist, Nemesis has full uses of its two Urban Legend abilities, but a creature can [[Actions/Seek|Seek]] or [[Actions/Sense Motive|Sense Motive]] (DC 37) Nemesis to attempt to disbelieve one of these abilities, thereafter treating that ability as if the brainchild didn't possess it."

    desc: " (curse,mental,occult) Normally, when a brainchild is destroyed, it returns after 2d4 days if anyone still fully believes it exists. Nemesis remains dead once slain by the PCs, but as the brainchild is slain, any PC within 120 feet must succeed at a `DC 30 Will check` save or become cursed.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The PC is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The PC fears that Nemesis might come back from death to strike at them as they sleep. The next time the PC attempts to rest for the night, they must succeed at a `DC 30 Will check` save or they'll awaken [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]] and must spend two hours rather than one to make their daily preparations. After this, the curse ends.\n\n**Failure** As success, but the curse persists until it's removed through magic like [[Spells/Cleanse Affliction|Cleanse Affliction]].\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the PCs also becomes [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] each time they fail their `DC 30 Will check` save to resist becoming fatigued."
