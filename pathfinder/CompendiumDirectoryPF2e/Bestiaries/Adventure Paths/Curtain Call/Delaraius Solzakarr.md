    desc: "  Norgorber granted Delaraius an eye to aid him in his quest for vengeance, but this eye also significantly enhances the priest. It grants him darkvision and [[Spells/Truesight|Truesight]] as a constant innate spell, and also increases all of his attribute modifiers by 4. He is immune to bleed damage, magical detection and mental communication (unless he chooses otherwise), and magical alteration of his memories unless he chooses to be affected or the effect comes from a deity or artifact. The _Skinsaw Eye_ serves as a religious symbol for Delaraius. If he ever loses the _Skinsaw Eye_, Delaraius loses all of these benefits and becomes [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 3]]."

He then attempts a `Medicine check` check against the target's Fortitude DC; on a success, that target is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] to Delaraius until the end of his turn.
