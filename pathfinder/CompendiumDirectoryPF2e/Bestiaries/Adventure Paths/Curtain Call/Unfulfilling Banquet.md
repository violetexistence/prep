    desc: "`pf2:r` (curse, divine, mental, misfortune) **Trigger** A creature tastes any of the food or beverages on the banquet table\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The flavor blooming in the triggering creature's mouth simultaneously delights and frustrates the triggering creature, who must attempt a `DC 47 Will check` save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The triggering creature is unsatisfied by the taste, but is otherwise temporarily immune to the Unfulfilling Banquet for 24 hours.\n\n**Success** The triggering creature is momentarily distracted by their unsatisfying taste, and until the start of their next turn takes a –2 status penalty to Perception checks.\n\n**Failure** The triggering creature becomes obsessed with dissatisfaction and becomes [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] (or increases their existing stupefied condition value from this hazard by 1, to a maximum of [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 4]]) for an unlimited duration.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature is compelled to taste something else from the table on their next turn and won't willingly move away from the table until they do so. They take a –2 status penalty on their Will save to resist the hazard's effects on their next taste."
