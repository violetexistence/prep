    desc: "  As brainchild except Father Skinsaw's abilities are determined by the collective memories of his worshippers and Norgorber himself. Instead of using [[Actions/Seek|Seek]] or [[Actions/Sense Motive|Sense Motive]] to disbelieve any of his abilities, a character who's discovered some of Norgorber's secrets can confront Father Skinsaw with these truths by using [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] (DC 41), or they can taunt him with these secrets by Creating a Diversion (DC 43). On a success, in addition to the normal effects, that person can disbelieve one of Father Skinsaw's following abilities: resistance to physical damage, the extra bleed damage caused by his Strikes, his occult innate spells, or his Grievous Cut ability.\n* * *\n\nA brainchild is sustained only by the reputation that precedes them. Mindless creatures are immune to a brainchild and can't perceive them.\n\nThe brainchild's size, features, and items, as well as the appearance of their attacks, match what the foes perceiving them expect. If foes expect to see different things, the brainchild chooses which to manifest. If any creature that can perceive the brainchild believes the brainchild has one of the abilities below, the brainchild has that ability.\n\nA creature can [[Actions/Seek|Seek]] or [[Actions/Sense Motive|Sense Motive]] (against the brainchild's Deception DC) to attempt to disbelieve an individual ability. If at any point no creature perceiving the brainchild believes in the ability, the brainchild loses that ability immediately. If foes expect different particulars, such as one believing the brainchild is immune to fire and another believing they're immune to divinations, the brainchild chooses one to have.\n\n*   **[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Tremorsense|Tremorsense]]** (imprecise) 100 feet\n*   **Immunity** to one damage type, magic school, or condition\n*   **Weakness** 10 to one damage type other than mental\n*   **Resistance** 10 to physical damage, with an exception for either cold iron or silver\n*   **[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Frightful Presence|Frightful Presence]]** (aura, emotion, fear, mental) 100 feet, DC 28\n*   **1d6 Extra Damage** on Strikes, of a type one foe believes in\n*   **Additional Spells** [[Spells/Phantom Pain|Phantom Pain]] and [[Spells/Shadow Blast|Shadow Blast]] at 6th rank"

Male variant brainchild

A rumor can become so vivid and so persistent that it comes to life, creating a brainchild-a living illusion that hatches from an intense belief in a remorseless and implacable killer. Often, these rumors swirl around the victims of a [[Spells/Phantasmal Killer|Phantasmal Killer]] spell. A brainchild's capabilities grow when they pursue a believer but deflate against skeptics, making them only as bad as one thinks they are. A simple drive to stalk, terrify, and kill propels a brainchild, but the creature might also exhibit other behaviors ascribed to them through gossip.
