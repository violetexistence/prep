    desc: "`pf2:r` (divine) **Trigger** A creature enters the cloud of magical sensors\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The rune causes a chain reaction throughout the room, causing all remaining active summoning runes in area **D2** to summon a Mask of Gray Master. The masks roll initiative and remain for 12 rounds, after which the effect ends and any remaining Masks disappear. A Mask also disappears if someone disables its linked trap before the duration expires. The Mask can use 3 actions each round and can use reactions, unlike most summoned creatures."
