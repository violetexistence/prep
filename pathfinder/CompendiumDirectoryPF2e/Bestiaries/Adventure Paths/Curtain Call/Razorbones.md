Variant tanglebones

Sometimes, when murderer buries a large number of victims in a mass grave, the vengeful spirits of the slain can become similarly tangled together. When these spirits can't untangle, they instead return to their physical remains, fusing into one horrific mass of bones and black, tar-like sludge-a tanglebones.

One awful tale speaks of a bitter old dowager who learned that, through a legal loophole, ownership of her estate would revert to her estranged daughter. She murdered her 13 servants, buried their bodies in the house's basement, and then played the gracious mother in handing over the manor keys at the appointed time. One night, the tanglebones that arose from the dowager's atrocity murdered the daughter and her family. By the time the authorities learned of what happened, the dowager had fled the nation, changed her identity, and (the story goes) wasted no time rebuilding her fortunes-this time becoming a queen.
