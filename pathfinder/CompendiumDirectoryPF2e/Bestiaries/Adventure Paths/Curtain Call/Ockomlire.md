With its mottled green-and-tan rubbery flesh, six short legs ending in two-clawed feet, and three circular mouths arrayed equidistantly around a disk-shaped head crowned by multiple bulbous eyes, the bizarre Darklands-dwelling ockomlire's strange appearance blurs the line between aberration and fungus.

Ockomlires eat magic, and their specialized organs process and release that magic in the form of a mist that saps the willpower of those it touches. Originally created by sekmin occultists as a potent weapon against Azlanti wizards, since the serpentfolk empire's collapse thousands of years ago, ockomlires have spread upward through the Darklands. They often lair in sewers or abandoned basements in urban areas, drawn to society's use (and waste) of magical energy.

Ockomlires are quite intelligent but tend to have bland personalities. They're fond of verbalizing their observations and experiences, speaking in unsettling piping voices through three mouths; they have a curious penchant for referring to themselves in the third person. They've little interest in having personal names and tend to refer to those they encounter by ancestry instead of name as well.

## Ockomlire Apathy

Because they exude feelings of hopelessness and despair as "waste" from their magical feeding, the ockomlire has become a creature of apathetic detachment. While this affords the ockomlire protection from emotion-based effects, those that do affect them tend to hit hard and actually cause mental anguish. There are thrilling legends of ockomlires laid low by a single bard whose gripping performance simply stirred up enough emotions within the normally distant creatures to cause them rip themselves apart from the inside.
