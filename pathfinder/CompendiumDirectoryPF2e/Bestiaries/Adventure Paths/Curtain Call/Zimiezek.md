The zimiezeks, also known as those-that-weave-secrets, are one of many creatures native to Duskfathom. They resemble large spiders with humanoid hands instead of spidery feet and possess vaguely humanoid heads with multiple eyes and spider fangs for jaws. Their faces are often shrouded by a veil, mask, or webbing to both hide their identity and as a gesture of peace, for a zimiezek's bite can turn other humanoids into them.

Unlike the karumzeks, Norgorber's more common divine servitors, zimiezeks almost never leave Duskfathom. Most are average citizens who revere Norgorber as both deity and prince. Only a few serve the god of secrets directly as the city's security and elite strike force.

## Uncertain Origins

The zimiezeks believe the first of them arose from souls who were once Norgorber's allies in life who stumbled upon the god's greatest secret and were slain to conceal his identity. Some doubt this claim, given Norgorber's anathema on showing mercy. Nevertheless, a connection exists between Norgorber and both zimiezeks and karumzeks that lets the god automatically know the creatures' names and identities.
