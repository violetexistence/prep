    desc: "`pf2:r` (emotion, fear, mental, occult) **Trigger** A PC approaches within 20 feet of the trap\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The rag-wrapped figure cries out in pain.

    desc: "(1 action; illusion, mental, occult, visual) The cruel welcome's head lifts, and it gazes at the closest PC within 20 feet; if there are no PCs in range, the trap does nothing, its turn ends, and it deactivates until midnight. The target must attempt a `DC 26 Will check` save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The PC is unaffected. For the next 24 hours, the PC gains a +4 circumstance bonus to all saving throws against cruel welcome traps.\n\n**Success** The PC recognizes the face of the tormented figure on the pole as that of a loved one, and the anguish of the sight results in 4d10 mental damage. For the next 24 hours, the PC gains a +4 circumstance bonus to all saving throws against cruel welcome traps.\n\n**Failure** As success, but 4d10+22 mental damage.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but 8d10+44 mental damage, and the PC becomes [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] for 24 hours."
