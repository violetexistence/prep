Masque mannequins are a type of soulbound construct animated by a fragment of a once-living soul infused into an eerie, nearly featureless mask that's then affixed to a mannequin or dressmaker's dummy. Though similar in process to the creation of a soulbound doll or mannequin, creating a masque mannequin requires conducting ritualistic murder and extracting a soul shard during an unwilling victim's death, and only the vilest of crafters would consider attempting such a deed. Masque mannequins are popular among Norgorberites, especially devotees of Father Skinsaw, as well as Kuthites who take pride in drawing out the ritual to gain the largest possible fragment of the soul.

## Malevolent Mindsets

Masque mannequins, even those crafted from virtuous individuals, tend to have a sadistic sense of malice. If left to their own devices, a masque mannequin enjoys playing cat and mouse games with their chosen victims by freezing and unfreezing in areas with mundane mannequins, slowly driving their unfortunate playthings to paranoia before going for the kill.
