  - name: "Change Shape"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (arcane,concentrate,polymorph) Blackfingers can take the shape of a Tiny spider. This doesn't change his Speed or jaws Strike, but prevents him from making dagger Strikes.\n* * *\n\nThe monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

  - name: "Stab! Stab! Stab! Stab!"
    desc: "`pf2:3`  **Requirements** Blackfingers is Consumed by Bloodlust\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Blackfingers lashes out and makes four dagger Strikes against adjacent targets at his current attack modifier but with a â€“2 penalty. Each attack counts toward his multiple attack penalty but the penalties don't apply until the end of this activity. On each successful hit he restores 15 healing Hit Points. Consumed by Bloodlust's effects then end."
