Shanty chanters are known to dwell along the coasts of Garund or the eastern isles of the Shackles, living on small islands or cliffsides but rarely venturing too far inland. These capricious fey have humanoid torsos and seagull heads, wings, and feet, and they stand about 5 feet tall. Consummate performers, shanty chanters adore music, especially the sea shanties sung by ships' crews. The songs from these fey's aeries can be heard from miles away over the open sea. While some sailors claim these songs intentionally lure mortals to drown, most shanty chanters aren't outright malevolent and would be more inclined to investigate a foundering ship than to slaughter those aboard, even if they do relieve such a vessel of its valuables.

Shanty chanters have a particular affinity for pirate ships, and a captain who wins an alliance with an aerie of shanty chanters is considered blessed with good luck. Of course, this attention can be a double-edged sword. If a captain fails to appease the ship's allied shanty chanters (generally by giving them a fair share of the plunder gained while they're on board), the affronted fey afflicts the captain with a [[Spells/Mariner's Curse|Mariner's Curse]] before departing for more prosperous shores.

## Chanter Vanity

Shanty chanters are quite vain, adorning themselves in jewelry obtained in the raids of their allied ships or taken in raids of their own. They appreciate flattery toward both their physical appearances and musical talents, and they view this type of bribe to be as valuable as material goods. Conversely, the surest way to gain a shanty chanter's enmity is to insult their singing, and only the deeply unwise would dare such a thing.
