When a group of diabolists or worshippers of an archdevil come to an ignominious end, their souls can sometimes be caught between life and death, unable or unwilling to pass on to the afterlife due to the humiliation of their untimely deaths. When enough closely-associated worshippers whose souls aren't already claimed in existing contracts meet such a fate, the spiritual "weight" of this shame can cause them to merge into a conglomeration of infernally-infused spirits—a hellshadow.

Hellshadows look like a bank of fire and smoke, yet the flames themselves are made of distorted bodies and faces. Although made of multiple souls, a hellshadow is a singular creature with one mind and typically one goal: to defeat as many enemies of their faith as they can in order to repay the shame of their humiliating deaths.

## Why Only Hell?

The nature of diabolic worship and the strict rules involved are a big part of the psychology of humiliation that causes devil worshippers to become hellshadows. This same mix of conditions is rarer among other fiendish cults, who are more likely to become more common undead after such a death. Non-diabolic– themed hellshadows are all but unknown as a result.
