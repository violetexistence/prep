    desc: "`DC 46 Thievery check` (master) to shut down all eight looms at once by activating either of the bypass locks once either lock is located (this check is automatically successful if Fenton's keys are used), `DC 37 Thievery check` (master) twice to shut down a single loom by deftly removing critical components, or [[Spells/Dispel Magic|Dispel Magic]] (7th rank, counteract DC 33) to counteract a single loom"

    desc: "`pf2:r` **Trigger** A Small or larger creature ends their turn in area **C6**\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The looms suddenly begin to grind and churn, filling the room with the squeal of metal on metal. All eight looms roll initiative."

  - name: "Routine"
    desc: "(1 action) Each loom takes one of two possible actions on its turn, depending on if it's currently restraining a creature or not.\n\n**Not Restraining a Creature:** If a loom isn't restraining a creature, it launches a tangle of yarn at a random creature in the room that isn't currently [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]. That creature must attempt a `DC 37 Reflex check` save. If there are no non-restrained targets for the loom to attempt to grapple, it takes no actions this round.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature is entangled, and becomes [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] until the end of the looms' next turn.\n\n**Failure** The creature is tangled in the yarn and becomes [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 2]] until the end of the loom's next turn—or if it already has the clumsy condition, it becomes restrained (see critical failure).\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature becomes restrained. A restrained creature can [[Actions/Force Open|Force Open]] the tangle of yarn or [[Actions/Escape|Escape]] with a DC 37 check.\n\n**Restraining a Creature:** If a loom has restrained a creature, it instead fires more lines of yarn at the restrained creature and then drags that creature (if the creature is Medium or smaller) 20 feet toward itself. (If it's restraining a Large or larger creature, it can only drag the creature 5 feet toward itself). If this dragging causes a creature to become adjacent to the loom, the loom pulls the creature into its grinding gears and inflicts 5d12 bludgeoning + 5d12 slashing damage to the creature (`DC 37 Reflex check` save). The creature is then placed in an adjacent square and is still restrained by that loom."
  - name: "Reset"
    desc: "A loom deactivates if no Small or larger creatures are in area **C6**, resetting in 1 minute unless disabled or all looms are broken."
