These masks focus on the use of poisons to spread Norgorber's will.

* * *

When a powerful worshipper catches Norgorber's eye, he sometimes transforms that worshipper into one of his masksâ€”supernatural incarnations who become powerful proxies to their god but sacrifice their free will.

## Other Ancestries

Most of the masks of Norgorber are human, but not all. A mask's statistics don't change if it's a Small creature, and they gain increased space and reach if they're Large or larger. Change ancestry traits as needed, but Speed and languages are unchanged. All masks of Norgorber possess darkvision granted them by their deity. Whether or not you grant a mask additional ancestry-based abilities is left to you to decide.

## Masks and the Afterlife

When a worshipper becomes a mask, they technically die and travel to the Boneyard to be judged by Pharasma, but in this case, the process is almost instantaneous. When Norgorber chooses someone to become a mask, a swift and nearly instantaneous blurring of the creature is the only indication of their change. Like most fiends, masks are immortal unless slain through violence or misadventure. Once slain, a mask's body decays as normal, and after a variable amount of time has passed, their soul returns to the Great Beyond to accrete its quintessence into Norgorber's realm of Duskfathom.
