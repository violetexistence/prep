In combat, Skurg typically uses this action either to try to Hide or move to be adjacent to an enemy if it's [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]], [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]], or [[Conditions/Undetected|Undetected]] so that when the Final Herald Casts or Sustains a hex, that adjacent enemy becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]] as a result of her Starless Shadow patronage."
