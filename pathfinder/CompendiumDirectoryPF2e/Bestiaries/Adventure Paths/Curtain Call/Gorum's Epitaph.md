    desc: "A section of ground thrusts up to form what looks like a mountain in which a sword has been impaled, and then the sword lashes out to stab at someone nearby. A successful `DC 15 Religion check` check to Recall Knowledge is enough to note that the hazard looks very similar to Gorum's religious symbol; any character who is at least expert in Religion notes this automatically."

The triggering creature must succeed at a `DC 36 Reflex check` save to avoid becoming [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the start of their next turn (plus being knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] on a critical failure). The trap then rolls initiative."

    desc: "(3 actions) If the Gorum's epitaph is adjacent to a creature, it uses its three actions to make greatsword Strikes on that creature (determining targets randomly if more than one creature is adjacent). Otherwise, it uses actions to Stride toward the closest visible target, then uses any remaining actions to Strike that target. Gray Master can flank with a Gorum's epitaph."
