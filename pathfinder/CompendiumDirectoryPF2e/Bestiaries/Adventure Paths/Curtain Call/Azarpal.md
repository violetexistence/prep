The azarpal can use this activity to reach into its mouth and retrieve a stored item as well. Any item that remains stored in an azarpal's stomach for at least 24 hours becomes laced with azarpal poison."

Azarpals resemble bipedal hogs with wide-tusked mouths, bloated bellies, and long, bristly tails. They can store food in their multiple stomachs for long periods of time, slowly infusing it with a signature poison that causes those afflicted to sweat profusely and succumb to intense nausea.

Azarpals love spreading discontent via poisoned food. They delight in traveling caravan routes, disguised as merchants, constantly sampling regional cuisines, and choosing their favorites for stomach storage and poison infusion. Then, upon reaching a land where the dish is rare or sought after, they find a place to leave the meal out for an unwary traveler. They might also find a way to introduce the poisoned meal to a tavern or restaurant and hang back to watch the resulting fun.

## Removing Azarpal Poison

Once an item of food or drink has been laced with azarpal poison, it can be detoxified through the use of a cleanse cuisine spell or by spending an hour using alchemical supplies to nullify the poison. This latter option requires access to an alchemical lab and a successful Crafting check against the azarpal's poison save DC.
