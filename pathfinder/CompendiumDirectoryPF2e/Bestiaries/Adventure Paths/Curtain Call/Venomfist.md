    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Frequency** once per day\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Venomfist transforms a portion of their watery body into a single dose of any type of common poison of 20th level or lower—tears of death is their favorite. If they're holding a container, they can create the poison within that container, at which point the poison remains viable for 24 hours before it reverts to water. Alternatively, they can apply a contact or injury-created poison to their fist."

  - name: "Surge"
    desc: "`pf2:2`  Venomfist expands their space to fill the area of their vortex. Creatures within the aura take 6d12+6 bludgeoning and 6d12+6 poison damage with a `DC 45 Fortitude check` save. A creature that fails this save is pushed 40 feet. Venomfist then retracts to their former space and cannot use Surge again for 1d4 rounds."

  - name: "Improved Grab"
    desc: "  **Requirements** The monster's last action was a successful Strike that lists Improved Grab in its damage entry, or the monster has a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]\n* * *\n\n**Effect** If used after a Strike, the monster attempts to [[Actions/grapple|grapple]] the creature using the body part it attacked with as a free action. This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead spend an action to use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."
