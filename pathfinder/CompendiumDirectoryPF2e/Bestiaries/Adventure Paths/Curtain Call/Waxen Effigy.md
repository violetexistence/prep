    desc: "  Waxen effigies retain an attachment to objects they had a strong tie to in life. A character who holds such a memento in a hand can use it to alter the effects of [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]]. Doing so adds the manipulate trait to Demoralize. If the attempt to Demoralize the waxen effigy is successful, it becomes [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] ([[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 2]] on a critical success) for 1 round rather than becoming frightened. On a critical failure, the waxen effigy loses Memento Vulnerability for 24 hours."

The undead ooze known as a waxen effigy forms under a specific set of circumstances, making such creatures quite rare. Most waxen effigies arise from botched rituals intended to migrate a powerful sapient creature's soul into a body made of wax, whether in a bid for immortality or a method of imprisonment or sacrifice. The death—especially a traumatic death—of a sapient creature in close proximity to a wax figure or while attempting to craft a construct out of wax might also result in a waxen effigy.

A waxen effigy looks like a partially melted wax version of who it appeared as in life. They retain little of their former personality but recall a jumble of memories from their mortal existence that serves only to anger them. They often cling to objects that were important to them in life, such as a spouse's wedding band or a tool from a favorite hobby. Displaying such an object to a waxen effigy transfixes their attention, though they often lash out if the object is taken away before they can be laid to rest.

## Cruel Creations

Few set out to create a waxen effigy on purpose, as their fragmented memories cause them to behave rather erratically, and as such, they make poor guardians or assassins. Any intentional creation of a waxen effigy is solely an act of spite since it condemns the soul to an undeath steeped in bewilderment and fear.
