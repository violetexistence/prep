With their hulking physiques and the potent connection to the Crown of the World, saumen kar who succumb to blackfrost become especially dangerous blackfrost dead. Those who guarded the Temple of Aqakaru in life continue to do so in undeath, albeit even more vigilantly and much more violently. Blackfrost prophets, as these wardens are sometimes known, maintain their formidable intellect and innate connection to their boreal environment, though the curse of blackfrost has stripped them of their memories and filled their hearts with evil.

These shambling arctic horrors are dead in name alone. Creatures who succumb to the frigid elements while cursed by blackfrost don't become mere corpses entombed in ice but rather vicious undead capable of spreading the curse of blackfrost even further. Cracked, frostbitten flesh that emits a freezing vapor like steam; inexorable, unhindered strides through feet of ash-blackened snow; a vacant, icy-blue gaze devoid of humanityâ€”the descriptions of blackfrost dead vary by the teller, but none can deny the supernatural dread these monsters evoke.

Blackfrost dead take a variety of forms. Most are mindless, lumbering brutes, largely indiscernible from mundane zombies except for the curse they can inflict. Others not only maintain their presence of mind but wield powers of psychic corruption not unlike those of blackfrost's originator, Osoyo, the Blackfrost Whale. What form a blackfrost dead takes depends primarily on the victim's psychic fortitude and its aptitude for occult magic.

### Creating Blackfrost Dead

The simplest way to create a blackfrost dead is to use an existing undead, such as a zombie or a mummy, as your base creature. Replace the creature's abilities with abilities from the list on this page. All blackfrost dead gain the cold trait and have at least one way to inflict blackfrost, often using one of their Strikes.

### Curse of the Crown

Blackfrost dead are found only around the Nameless Spires, under which a massive alien being named Osoyo remains imprisoned. Only recently has this ancient being stirred from its slumber, causing blackfrost to foam out of fissures in the ice and afflict unfortunate explorers. The spread of the blackfrost curse has been mercifully slow thus far, but with each creature afflicted, Osoyo's reach expands ever outward.
