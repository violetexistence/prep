Mindmoppets are the result of laboratory experimentation that sought to harness telepathic energy within a liquid alchemical concoction. Mindmoppets feed on the latent telepathic energy of creatures. Even those with no apparent gift but with an active mind can sustain a mindmoppet for days. Such feeding is not invasive, and mindmoppets continually "graze" even while inactive.

Mindmoppets are willing servants to anyone who concerns themselves with strenuous mental exercise. Their creator is usually an obvious first choice, and they serve them dutifully. However, they have only an academic understanding of good and evil, of ethics, or mortal limitations. They see service to their master's science as the ultimate standard by which they judge their actions or those of others. This can lead to conflict between them and their creator, especially if the master appears lax in their efforts to further their studies. To a mindmoppet, continuous learning is imperative.

Mindmoppets appear to have some ability to see a short distance into the future, though this might only be that their innate interest for thought and cognition gives them a knack for anticipating the actions of others.

### Scavenged Shell

Being amorphous, mindmoppets are resilient, but they still cling to their shells for protection. You can represent a shell of different material by replacing the Hardness, Hit Points, and Broken Threshold of the porcelain shell listed here with those listed in the Materials section of the Pathfinder Core Rulebook.
