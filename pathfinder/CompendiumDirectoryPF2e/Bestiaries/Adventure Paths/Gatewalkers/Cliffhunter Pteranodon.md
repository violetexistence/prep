The pteranodon makes an `Athletics check` check against the target's Fortitude DC.\n\n**Success** The target creature is flung 15 feet in a direction of the pteranodon's choosing and potentially falls or takes damage accordingly. The creature cannot use the [[Actions/Grab an Edge|Grab an Edge]] reaction.\n\n**Failure** The pteranodon fails to move the target creature.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the pteranodon's clumsy movement leaves it open to attack. The pteranodon's turn ends, and it becomes off-guard until the beginning of its next turn."

Variant pteranodon

Pteranodons are quick and agile reptiles with 20-foot wingspans that enable them to hover on wind currents for hours. These creatures have long beaks and equally long crests that protrude from the backs of their heads.

Pterosaurs are primitive flying creatures. While many are smaller than a human, the two presented below are quite a bit larger. Each of these creatures could pose a serious threat to a person. These flying reptiles can be found in a wide selection of regions, but they tend to soar above warm or temperate climates.
