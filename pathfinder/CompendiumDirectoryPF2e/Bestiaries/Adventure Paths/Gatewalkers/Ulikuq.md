    desc: " (concentrate) Ulikuq spends 10 minutes to plot a course and attempts a `DC 20 Sailing Lore check` or `DC 20 Survival check` check. This check is reduced to DC 15 in an arctic environment such as the Crown of the World (`DC 15 Sailing Lore check` or `DC 15 Survival check`). On a success, the severity of environmental conditions during the journey is reduced by one step for 24 hours (two steps on a critical success). This changes moderate damage to minor damage, winds that create greater difficult terrain cause only difficult terrain, and so on."
