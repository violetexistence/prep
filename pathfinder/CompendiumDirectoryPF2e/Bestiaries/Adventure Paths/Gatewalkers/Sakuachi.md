    desc: " (concentrate,manipulate) **Requirements** Sakuachi is holding an astrolabe and can see the stars\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Sakuachi spends 1 hour attempting to gain a vague glimpse of the future written in the stars. She attempts a Fortune-Telling Lore or `DC 24 Occultism check` check.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** Sakuachi receives an accurate vision of an event to come within the next week. While this vision can be vague and confusing, it's typically true.\n\n**Success** As critical success, but the vision is of an event that will occur within the next day. If nothing noteworthy is to happen within the next day, she sees nothing written in the stars.\n\n**Failure** Sakuachi sees nothing written in the stars.\n\n**Critical Failure** Sakuachi misinterprets the writing in the stars and receives an inaccurate vision of an upcoming event. Such a vision looks the same as one achieved with a critical success, but is typically false."
