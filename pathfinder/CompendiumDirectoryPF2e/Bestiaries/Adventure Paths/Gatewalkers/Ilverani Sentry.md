    desc: "  The Ilverani sentry ignores the effects of difficult terrain from snowy environments. When moving through snow, an Ilverani sentry minimizes traces left behind and makes it harder for others to find them. The DC of checks to [[Actions/Track|Track]] an Ilverani sentry through snowy terrain gains a +4 status bonus."

    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate) The Ilverani sentry designates a single creature they can see and hear, or one they're Tracking, as their prey. The sentry gains a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to [[Actions/Seek|Seek]] the prey and to Survival checks to [[Actions/Track|Track]] the prey. The first time the sentry hits the designated prey in a round, they deal an additional 1d8 precision damage. The sentry ignores the penalty for making ranged attacks within their second range increment. These effects last until the sentry uses Hunt Prey again."
