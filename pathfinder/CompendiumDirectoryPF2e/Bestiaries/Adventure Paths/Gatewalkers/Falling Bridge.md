    desc: "`pf2:r` **Trigger** A Medium or larger creature steps onto the middle of the bridge (any of the squares marked \"T\" on the map)\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The ropes on both sides of the bridge snap simultaneously, causing the bridge to collapse. Any creature on the bridge falls to the forest floor 50 feet below and takes 25 bludgeoning. A creature within 10 feet of one end of the bridge can attempt a `DC 18 Reflex check` saving throw to Grab a Ledge along the side of either **A8** or **A13**.\n\nIf one side of the bridge has been disabled by resecuring the ropes, a character on any section of the bridge can attempt a `DC 18 Reflex check` save to hang onto the bridge as one side of it falls. The dangling bridge thereafter functions as a ladder connecting either area **A8** or **A13** (whichever was secured) to the forest floor."
