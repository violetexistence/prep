    desc: "  A capstan swabbie is attached to its anchor by a 100-foot-long rope, most of which it keeps coiled around its body. If the capstan swabbie tries to move more than 100 feet from its attached anchor, its Speed is reduced to 10 feet as it drags the anchor along with it. If this rope is severed (AC 12 when uncoiled, Hardness 4, HP 16), the capstan swabbie can move freely, but its ranged anchor Strike loses the tethered trait."

Capstan swabbies are constructs specially designed for seafaring. Sea captains looking for unwavering loyalty and competence can do far worse than a swabbie.

Built to resemble and assume the place of a ship's capstan—the winch that raises and lowers the anchor—a capstan swabbie is a round, stout cylinder of wood wrapped in heavy-duty rope. Spars spaced evenly around its frame complete the look, while castors on its base give the swabbie mobility. A capstan swabbie also sports a few small pegs around its diameter. It can use these appendages to "grab" other ropes from the rigging to help sail the ship. Some crews decorate their capstan swabbies with paint or rags to give the constructs a personal touch.

A capstan swabbie instinctively protects its captain's ship. Using short ropes attached to its sides, the swabbie can lash and trip foes or make emergency repairs to itself or its vessel. Far more dangerous, of course, is the anchor to which the swabbie's longest rope is attached. A capstan swabbie can swing this anchor in wide arcs and reel it back in at a moment's notice.

## Constructed Crews

Only the wealthiest captains can afford to craft or purchase a capstan swabbie, but there might be another way to obtain one. According to legend, the ancient Jistka Imperium possessed a "mechanical navy"—a fleet of warships crewed by constructs under the command of a powerful mage. Treasure hunters plying the right waters might be lucky enough to find an intact capstan swabbie from this bygone empire.
