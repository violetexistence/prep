    desc: "`pf2:r` (incapacitation, mental, occult, sleep) **Trigger** A creature lies down on the bed, or a living creature spends more than 3 rounds inside this room\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Incense swiftly fills the room (even if the incense burners have been removed or were destroyed). All creatures in area **A12** must attempt a `DC 32 Fortitude check` save. The haunt then rolls initiative.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] by the incense's scent.\n\n**Failure** The creature falls [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]]. If it's still unconscious after 1 minute, it wakes up automatically.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but if it's still unconscious after 1 hour, it wakes up automatically."

  - name: "Routine"
    desc: "(2 actions; cold, mental, occult) The haunt uses its first action to light incense burners again, forcing any creature that isn't already [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]] to save against that effect once more. Its second action is to cause any unconscious creatures in the room to experience horrific, vivid dreams about being lost in the arctic during a blizzard, while enormous furred figures— saumen kar—lunge at them through the snow to attack repeatedly. Each unconscious creature must attempt a `DC 28 Fortitude check` saving throw. If at the end of the round there are no unconscious creatures in the room, Etward's nightmare ends and the trap deactivates.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected and wakes up.\n\n**Success** The creature remains unconscious and takes 1d10 cold + 1d10 mental. This damage does not wake the creature, and those who are awake can see the unconscious creature thrash as if in the throes of a nightmare while their body rimes over with layers of frost. The creature can fight against the bitter cold and monstrous shapes by attempting a `DC 28 Will check` save as a three-action activity on its turn— on a success, the creature wakes up.\n\n**Failure** As success, but 1d10+6 cold + 1d10+6 mental, and with a `DC 32 Will check` save to wake up.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature remains unconscious and takes 2d10+12 cold + 2d10+12 mental."
