The tree fisher can move while it has a creature grabbed with its filament, but automatically releases the Grab if the tree fisher moves beyond the filament's 60-foot length. A creature grabbed by the filament at the beginning of its turn takes 5 bleed.\n\nThe tree fisher can sever the filament and release any creature grabbed by it as a free action. The filament can be severed by a Strike that deals at least 10 slashing to it. This doesn't deal any damage to the tree fisher itself. The filament has AC 17, and its [[Actions/Escape|Escape]] DC is 19.\n\nThe tree fisher has only one harpoon; if the filament is severed, the tree fisher loses this ability and its ranged attack for 1 week as it fashions a new harpoon."

A gokeki looks like a cross between a monkey and a scorpion, with a harpoon of solidified webbing connected to spinnerets at its aft end, held by the coiled, scorpion-like tail that acts like an atlatl. Adding further to the gokeki's bizarre appearance are the creature's extra pair of eyes and the nearly vestigial pincers sprouting from its chest. Gokeki fur is generally light tan in color, darkening noticeably toward the creature's tail, although subspecies with bright green, yellow, or even fluorescent pink or purple fur have also been reported.

Unlike many of Castrovel's native creatures, gokekis aren't generally regarded to be a product of natural evolution, but rather the result of a genetic experiment that broke loose from its creator and escaped into the wild. Gokekis have adapted frighteningly well to the planet's harsh jungle environment, although thankfully they seem to lack both the intelligence and sociability often exhibited by primates. Gokekis hunt alone or, more rarely, in mated pairs. Attempts to domesticate gokekis often result in the death of their would-be owners, although when provided with a proper range in which to hunt, gokekis can serve as guardians for those looking to deter unwanted visitors.

Though dangerous predators, gokekis are highly sought after by Castrovel's hunting cultures, particularly the lizardfolk and tripkees who call the jungle continent of Ukulam their home. The former value gokekis for their webbing harpoons, which function as ready-made javelins. Meanwhile, tripkees harvest the gokeki's filament gland to aid in the construction of the treetop homes. Both peoples also eat gokeki meat, which when properly prepared can be made into a flavorful and hearty jerky.

## Harvested Treasures

While gokekis aren't intelligent enough to gather treasure of their own, many natives of Castrovel consider their bodies a valuable resource. If harvested with a successful `DC 17 Nature check` or `DC 17 Survival check` check, the gokeki's filament gland can be used as 25 gp worth of raw materials for potent glues such as [[Equipment/Everlasting Adhesive|Everlasting Adhesive]]. The filament itself is identical to a 60-foot length of rope. Finally, the creature's harpoon can be used as a javelin.
