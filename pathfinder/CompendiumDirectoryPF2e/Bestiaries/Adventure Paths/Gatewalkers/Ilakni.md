    desc: " (cold,curse,disease,occult) This affliction can't be reduced below stage 1, nor the damage from it healed, until successfully treated with [[Spells/Cleanse Affliction|Cleanse Affliction]] or a similar effect; the affliction can then be removed as a normal disease. A creature that dies from cold damage while cursed with blackfrost rises as a blackfrost dead after 24 hours. Blackfrost has a counteract rank of 10.\n\n**Saving Throw** `DC 27 Fortitude check`\n\n**Stage 1** 4d6 cold (1 minute)\n\n**Stage 2** weakness to cold 5 and [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]] (1 day)\n\n**Stage 3** weakness to cold 10 and [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 2]] (1 day)"

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Constrict|Constrict]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  1d8+12 bludgeoning, `DC 30 Fortitude check`\n* * *\n\nThe monster deals the listed amount of damage to any number of creatures [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]] by it. Each of those creatures can attempt a basic Fortitude save with the listed DC."

  - name: "Siphon Mind"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (mental,occult) **Requirements** The target creature is [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] by Ilakni, is helpless, or is willing, and is adjacent to Ilakni\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Ilakni extrudes a seething forest of tendrils from his mouth to wrap around the target's head. These tendrils begin siphoning away the target's mind to make them an empty vessel, ready to be inhabited by Osoyo in the future. The target must attempt a `DC 30 Will check` save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected and is temporarily immune to Siphon Mind for 24 hours.\n\n**Success** The target takes 3d6 mental.\n\n**Failure** The target takes 6d6 mental and becomes [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]], or increases its stupefied value by 1 to a maximum of [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 4]]. If the creature dies as a result of this mental damage, its body remains alive while its mind and soul move on. The body can remain alive without its soul and mind for many years, as long as it is cared for. If Osoyo escapes from its prison, a body in this state becomes animated by Osoyo's will, transforming into an entity with the same statistics as Ilakni but directly controlled by the Blackfrost Whale. If the body is restored to life before this event, this development can be avoided.\n\n**Critical Failure** As critical failure, but 12d6 mental and [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] (or increases its stupefied value by 2, to a maximum of 4)."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Grab|Grab]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** The monster's last action was a successful Strike that lists Grab in its damage entry, or the monster has a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]\n* * *\n\n**Effect** If used after a Strike, the monster attempts to [[Actions/grapple|grapple]] the creature using the body part it attacked with. This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."
