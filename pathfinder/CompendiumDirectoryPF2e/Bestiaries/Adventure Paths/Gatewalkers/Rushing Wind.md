Each affected creature must attempt a `DC 18 Fortitude check` save.\n\n**Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Failure** The creature is pulled 5 feet toward the _aiudara_ and is [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]]. If the creature is already adjacent to the _aiudara_, it doesn't move but is [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 2]].\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature is pulled 10 feet toward the _aiudara_, falls [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]], and is stunned 1. If the creature is already adjacent to the _aiudara_, it doesn't move but falls prone and is stunned 2."
