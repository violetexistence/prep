Often seen at the sides of spellcasters, scalescribes are tiny, snakelike creatures with numerous hands that usually hold a multitude of fountain pens in various ink colors. The words scrawled across their bodies shift depending on what texts they've encountered recently. Scalescribes have a fondness for language, especially magical language, and make their homes in libraries or other places of learning.
