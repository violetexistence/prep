As long as the queen is healthy, the environment is exceptionally resilient, allowing the nymph queen to automatically attempt to counteract spells and rituals such as [[Spells/Blight|Blight]] that would harm the environment, using her Spell DC with a counteract rank equal to the highest-level druid spell she can cast. When the nymph queen becomes physically or psychologically unhealthy, however, her warded region eventually becomes twisted or unhealthy as well. In that case, restoring the nymph queen swiftly heals the entire region."

It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

The creature must attempt a `DC 23 Will check` save.

female naiad queen

Naiad queens rule over pristine wildernesses centered on untouched lakes or other bodies of fresh water. Bards' songs and artists' paintings of nymphs tend to depict naiad queens in their slightly more humanoid forms, which they don when they make the rare journey into civilized lands to garner allies or gauge threats.

Most naiad queens treat those who respect their domains with kindness, but they are fierce and quick in eliminating foes. Their blinding beauty and breadth of offensive spells make naiad queens fierce opponents if forced into a fight.

* * *

Nymphs are a family of fey that take the form of beautiful humanoids with elven features and have a deep association with the natural world. The most common of their kind are the dryads, which are spirits that embody great trees, but many other kinds of nymphs exist, including naiads, who watch over bodies of water. All nymphs are guardians of some element of nature, typically a specific tree or pond, or even-in the case of nymph queens-whole forests or massive bodies of water
