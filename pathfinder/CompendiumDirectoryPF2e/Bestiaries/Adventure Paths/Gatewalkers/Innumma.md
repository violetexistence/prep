    desc: " (concentrate) **Requirements** Innumma is outdoors\n\n**Frequency** once per day\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Innumma spends 10 minutes observing the environment, trying to predict the day's weather. He attempts a `DC 20 Survival check` or `DC 20 Weather Lore check` check. This check is reduced to DC 15 in an arctic environment such as the Crown of the World (`DC 15 Survival check` or `DC 15 Weather Lore check`).\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** Innumma accurately predicts the day's weather. He learns if a weather event will occur in the region within the next 24 hours, and if so, what the event is and approximately when it will occur. He gains a +2 circumstance bonus to Survival checks made to prepare for this weather event.\n\n**Success** As critical success, but Innumma gains only a +1 circumstance bonus to Survival checks made to prepare for any weather event that might occur.\n\n**Failure** Innumma can't determine anything about the day's weather.\n\n**Critical Failure** Innumma misinterprets the environment's indicators, predicting a weather event as if he had earned a critical success but which will not occur that day."
