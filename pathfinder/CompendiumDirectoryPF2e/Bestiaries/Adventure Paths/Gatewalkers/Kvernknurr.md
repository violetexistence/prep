  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Swallow Whole|Swallow Whole]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (attack) Medium, 1d6+5 bludgeoning, Rupture 15\n* * *\n\nThe monster attempts to swallow a creature of the listed size or smaller that it has grabbed or restrained in its jaws or mouth. If a swallowed creature is of the maximum size listed, the monster can't use Swallow Whole again. If the creature is smaller than the maximum, the monster can usually swallow more creatures; the GM determines the maximum. The monster attempts an `Athletics check` check opposed by the grabbed creature's Reflex DC. If it succeeds, it swallows the creature. The monster's mouth or jaws no longer grab a creature it has swallowed, so the monster is free to use them to Strike or Grab once again. The monster can't attack creatures it has swallowed.\n\nA swallowed creature is [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]], is [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]], and has to hold its breath or start suffocating. The swallowed creature takes the listed amount of damage when first swallowed and at the end of each of its turns while it's swallowed. If the victim [[Actions/Escape|Escapes]] this ability's grabbed condition, it exits through the monster's mouth. This frees any other creature grabbed in the monster's mouth or jaws. A swallowed creature can attack the monster that has swallowed it, but only with unarmed attacks or with weapons of light Bulk or less. The swallowing creature is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] against the attack. If the monster takes piercing or slashing damage equaling or exceeding the listed Rupture value from a single attack or spell, the swallowed creature cuts itself free. A creature that gets free by either Escaping or cutting itself free can immediately breathe and exits the swallowing monster's space.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Engulf and Swallow Whole|Effect: Engulf and Swallow Whole]]\n\nIf the monster dies, a swallowed creature can be freed by creatures adjacent to the corpse if they spend a combined total of 3 actions cutting the monster open with a weapon or unarmed attack that deals piercing or slashing damage."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Grab|Grab]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** The monster's last action was a successful Strike that lists Grab in its damage entry, or the monster has a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]\n* * *\n\n**Effect** If used after a Strike, the monster attempts to [[Actions/grapple|grapple]] the creature using the body part it attacked with. This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

Kvernknurrs are lanky fey giants that dwell in cold-water rivers and lakes. A kvernknurr's blue flesh allows it to camoufage itself in its preferred environ, where it haunts local millers and farmers by sabotaging water wheels and farm equipment.

A kvernknurr's most distinguishing feature is its oversized mouth and the two rows of axe-like teeth therein. To eat, a kvernknurr need only unhinge its lower jaw, revealing in the process a yawning portal nearly the size of a human doorwayâ€”convenient, considering its favorite food is humans and their ilk.

A lake- or riverbed is the perfect place for a kvernknurr to sleep off a big meal. It's also a perilous circumstance for swallowed prey lucky enough to escape the kvernknurr's belly. "Out of the belly, into the water," goes one lakeside village saying.

Kverknurrs despise humanoid-made disturbances to the waters in which they live, even seemingly harmless ones like waterwheels. In their anger, kvernknurrs use their oversized jaws to clamp down on such machinery. When townsfolk come to investigate their jammed mill, the kvernknurr then springs out from hiding to attack, roaring terribly before snatching a victim to eat whole. Folks brave enough to attack a kvernknurr soon learn to fight up close; the wily monster is quick enough to snatch arrows and spears in its jaws midair before swallowing the weapons down.
