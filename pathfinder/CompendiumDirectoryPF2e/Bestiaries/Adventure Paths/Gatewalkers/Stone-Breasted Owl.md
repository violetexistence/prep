The bond ends if the spirit guide or the mortal dies.\n\nThis bond strengthens the spirit guide's connection to the Material Plane. While bonded, the spirit guide loses the incorporeal and spirit traits, loses their immunities and resistances, and changes their Strikes to deal the appropriate physical damage (typically piercing or slashing) instead of force damage."

Sage spirit guides are among the wisest spirits. They often take the forms of raptors such as owls, using their keen senses to evaluate situations from high above before swooping in to aid imperiled mortals.

Adventurers who befriend a sage guide are fortunate indeed; in addition to providing sage counsel before conflict begins, sage guides can restore and tend to their allies in the aftermath of a violent dispute.

In many stories, the sage guide assumes the form of a large owl whose proud breast is composed of hard stone. This depiction combines the wisdom commonly attributed to the owl with the strength and fortitude of the earth.

Spirit guides are ghostly creatures that manifest as primordial animals in the Universe. Many Sarkorian cultures believe that spirit guides came into being as the first mortal hunting bands began to form. In this time before time, spirit guides adopted the most elemental shapes of animals, and they taught humanoid communities about important aspects of nature, such as where to find fresh water, which plants were safe to eat, and how to live in harmony with their environment. As they imparted their wisdom, spirit guides took more physical forms, eventually becoming the wild animals that exist today. Though spirit guides bestowed most of their gifts unto mortals in ancient times, a rare few continue to lurk in forgotten or as-of-yet-undiscovered corners of the physical world.

## Spirit Guide Companions

One way to gain the aid of a spirit guide is to take the [[PF2e Journals/Archetypes/scion of Domora|scion of Domora]] archetype. This archetype allows character to choose a spirit guide to accompany them on their adventuresâ€”provided they first prove themselves worthy of the honor.

## The Sarkoris Scar

Some spirit guides encountered in the haunted badlands now known as the Sarkoris Scar are remnants of god calling, an ancient tradition practiced by many Sarkorian cultures. Severed from their callers by the demonic war that devastated the land for over a century, such gods now roam the blasted landscape, occasionally helping those they find worthy.
