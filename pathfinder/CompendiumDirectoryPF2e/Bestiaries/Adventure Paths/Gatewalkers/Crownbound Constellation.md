Crownbound constellations are the essence of stars granted sentience by the goddess Desna, who created them to survey the vastness of space and help her craft the galaxy. Their intergalactic travels once took them far, but Lamashtu sought to ensnare Desna's creation. The Mother of Beasts lured them to Golarion and then, exploiting the power of Golarion's sun, corrupted their ability to star travel. Stranded on the planet and unable to bear sunlight, these creatures traveled to the Crown of the World, where they have settled ever since.

### An Eon's Long Memory

Crownbound constellations have not forgotten Lamashtu's deception, or the commission set for them by Desna. Crownbound constellations frequently attack those they assume to be in league with the Mother of Monsters, and their hatred for her has severed their connection to Desna, just as Lamashtu planned.
