For a brief instant, the character recalls facing down a much larger and fully formed saumen kar, one with four horns and glowing runes on its fur. This memory of the character's first encounter with Ainamuuren evokes waves of fear and shame. The character must make a successful `DC 25 Will check` save or become [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]] ([[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] on a critical failure), after which the character is immune to Trigger Memory."
