    desc: "`pf2:r` **Trigger** The shelf is attacked or touched forcefully (such as by a creature Shoved into it)\n\nAny attack that fails to destroy the shelf triggers its Topple reaction\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The shelf tumbles over in the direction opposite its triggering creature, crashing onto the ground in a 10-foot-by-10-foot area. Creatures in the area take 4d8+10 bludgeoning (`DC 25 Reflex check`). A creature that critically fails its save falls [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]. The affected area becomes difficult terrain.\n\nIf the toppling shelf crashes into a space occupied by another toppling shelf, it triggers that shelf's Topple reaction. This can result in a chain reaction that causes multiple shelves to Topple, one after the other."
