    desc: "`pf2:2` (primal) Bolan compels plant-based materials within 10 feet of him to grow sharp thorns and spiky branches. This ability affects all walls, floors, and large objects made from dead organic material, such as wood. Affected areas become difficult terrain. Non-fey and non-plant creatures in the affected area or those who move through an affected square take 2d10 piercing (`DC 18 Reflex check`). This ability does not affect stone, dirt, living plants, or other materials. The effect ends when Bolan moves out of his square."

  - name: "Item Treachery"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (primal) Bolan targets a held item (such as a bow stave, wooden shield, or scroll) within 60 feet composed, at least partially, of wood, cotton, or other dead plant matter. The plant-based part of this item animates and attempts to wriggle free of its holder's grasp. The holder must attempt a `DC 18 Reflex check` save.\n* * *\n\n**Success** The creature holds onto the item with no ill effect.\n\n**Failure** The creature struggles to hold onto the item. Until the start of the creature's next turn, attempts to [[Actions/Disarm|Disarm]] the creature of that item gain a +2 circumstance bonus, and the creature takes a –2 circumstance penalty to attacks with the item or other checks requiring a firm grasp on the item.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature drops the item into the creature's space or drops the object in an adjacent square of Bolan's choice, at which point the item returns to normal."

  - name: "Vengeful Fibers"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (primal) A piece of clothing animates and attacks its wearer at Bolan's command. Bolan targets a creature within 60 feet wearing clothing made from plants, such as cotton, hemp, or grass. The clothing chokes its wearer, restricts their movement, and abrades their skin. The target takes 2d10 bludgeoning (`DC 18 Fortitude check`). A creature that takes damage in this way is also [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] and takes a –10-foot circumstance penalty to Speed until the beginning of Bolan's next turn.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Vengeful Fibers|Effect: Vengeful Fibers]]"
