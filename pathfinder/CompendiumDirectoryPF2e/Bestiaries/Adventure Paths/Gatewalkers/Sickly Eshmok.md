    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,divine,polymorph) The eshmok turns into their fungus form or back into their normal humanoid wasp form. In fungus form, they lose their fly Speed and can't make stinger Strikes. In fungus form, they gain a tendril melee Strike (+21 for 2d8+9 slashing plus eshmok infection); the tendril strike has the agile, magical, reach 10 feet, and unholy traits.\n* * *\n\nThe monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

The swarming fiend wasps linger in the area for 6 rounds or until the eshmok is able to use Infesting Exhalation again, whichever comes first. Each creature damaged by Infesting Exhalation or that enters the area must succeed at a `DC 28 Fortitude check` save or take 2d8 persistent poison damage and become [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] as the poison renders them dizzy and nauseous. At the end of each of their turns, they can attempt a new Fortitude save to end the effects. The eshmok can't use Infesting Exhalation again for 1d6 rounds."

Variant eshmok

Eshmoks are proof that anger consumes a creature. Formed from wrathful souls, these demons resemble giant humanoid wasps who have fallen victim to parasitic fungi. The fungi's foul-looking fibrous material is a physical manifestation of wrath. Tendrils of it burst from eshmok bodies, emitting rage-inducing spores, while lattices of nest-like growths from their torsos shelter wasplike infestations.

## Wrathful Parasites

The swarms that infest an eshmok aren't its allies, but incarnations of anger that serve to constantly harry and agonize the creature. Some maintain that these wasps are manifestations of Calistria's vengeance, but her faithful believe something closer to the truthâ€”that these wasps represent a mockery of vengeance and a corruption of the directed rage their goddess teaches and epitomizes. Eshmoks are particularly reviled by worshipers of Calistria as a result.
