    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,divine,polymorph) The kithangian can take on the appearance of any Medium or Large animal. This doesn't change its Speed or their attack and damage modif ers with its Strikes, but it might change the damage type its Strikes deal.\n\nThe monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

The kithangian—a horrifying amalgam of horse and scorpion also known as a "beast demon"—is a foul fend born of the souls of mortals who abused and tormented animals in life. Kithangians tend to roam wild areas rife with animals to torture, though humanoid settlements with plenty of pets or livestock also make for tantalizing hunting grounds. Uncontested for too long, a kithangian's presence has a corrupting influence on the local fauna, which birth fiendish monstrosities until the demon is vanquished. If it realizes it's being tracked by vengeful druids or demon slayers, a kithangian assumes the shape of an unassuming animal so it can get the jump on its pursuers.
