    desc: "  Tremorsense allows a monster to feel the vibrations through a solid surface caused by movement. It is an imprecise sense with a limited range (listed in the ability). Tremorsense functions only if the monster is on the same surface as the subject, and only if the subject is moving along (or burrowing through) the surface."

Caustic fluid seeps out from the scales of these sluglike cones, which spawn in unsuspecting hosts until they're mature enough to seek a place to root. Moving in writhing swarms that seek a habitat flush with prey, creeping cones spread Ayrzul's Blight when destroyed, but leaving them to grow unchecked poses a great risk to other creatures.

* * *

The Plane of Wood contains many unique ecosystems formed around species of wondrous trees; when Ayrzul's Blight mutates one of these trees rather than killing it, it can have a cascading effect on the tree's biome. Multiple species often mutate in tandem, becoming warped mockeries and a vector for Ayrzul's Blight. These "blight bonded" creature families are parasites and predators and typically form twisted symbiotic relationships.
