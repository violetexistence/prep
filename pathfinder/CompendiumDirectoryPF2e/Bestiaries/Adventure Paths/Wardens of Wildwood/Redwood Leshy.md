    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,polymorph) The redwood leshy can take the form of a Large tree, using the effects of [[Spells/One with Plants|One with Plants]].\n* * *\n\nThe monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

Guardians of old growth forests and the mightiest trees, redwood leshies behave with the courage and self-assurance that they believe befits their legacy. They rarely lord their duties over other leshies, instead believing it's their responsibility to shield, guide, and provide for others.

* * *

For all their cute appearances and harmless pretenses, leshies can become a formidable force when riled. What's more, leshies can grow larger, stronger, and more aggressive in regions rich in primal energy. The following presents several higher-level leshy threats that grow in primordial forests.
