In the pockets of old growth that form the most primeval and untamed regions of the Verduran Forest, there are trees of truly staggering size. The upper reaches of these gargantuan trees are the natural domain of the chetamog: a horse-sized arboreal rodent with a bulk belied by the preternatural grace with which it leaps through the canopy. Their speed and agility, as well as a natural intelligence and aptitude for training, have made chetamogs highly sought-after animal companions for those whose travels take them into the depths of the forest, a demand that has been recognized by enterprising ranchers who breed and raise the creatures for precisely this purpose.

A fully grown chetamog resembles an enormous squirrel, roughly 9 feet long and 5 feet high at the shoulder. Properly trained chetamogs are capable of serving as combat mounts. Few sights can match the glory of chetamog cavalry gliding effortlessly through thick ground cover and striking down a legion of earthbound foes before vanishing back into the treetops with ease.

## Natural Hoarders

Chetamogs have a well-documented proclivity for stealing items and burying them in hidden caches throughout the forest, a majority of which are promptly forgotten and never recovered by the chetamog responsible. Although food items are generally preferred, chetamogs are also fascinated by brightly colored, shiny, and particularly fragrant items of any kind, and numerous tales persist of all manner of strange and valuable treasures being discovered in unexpected locations by fortunate explorers while traveling through chetamog territory.
