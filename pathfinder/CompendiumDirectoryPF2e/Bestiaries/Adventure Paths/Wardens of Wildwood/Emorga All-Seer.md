    desc: " (concentrate,primal) **Frequency** once per day\n\n**Requirements** Emorga can see a naturally occurring pattern such as ripples in a pond, a murmuration of birds wheeling across the sky, or a tangle of interwoven vines and flowers\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Emorga spends 1 hour contemplating the pattern to receive a brief glimpse of possible futures, optionally posing a question about a specific person, place, or event. She attempts a `DC 30 Nature check` or `DC 30 Soothsaying Lore check` check.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** Emorga receives a helpful premonition of one significant event that is to occur within one week. If she specified a specific subject, the premonition relates specifically to events affecting or involving that subject. These visions might be partial or unclear, but they are never purposely misleading.\n\n**Success** As critical success, but Emorga can only receive visions of events that will occur within the next 1d4 days.\n\n**Failure** Emorga receives no vision, or receives a vision of something insignificant or unrelated to her subject.\n\n**Critical Failure** Emorga incorrectly interprets the omens and receives a false vision. Treat as a critical success, but the vision is either wholly inaccurate or presented in a way that actively distorts its meaning."
