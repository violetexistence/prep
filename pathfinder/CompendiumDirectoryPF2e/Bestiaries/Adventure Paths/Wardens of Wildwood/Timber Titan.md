Giant animated statues' increased size and power make them most useful in large vaults, spacious chambers, or outdoor locations. Tasks beyond their capabilities typically require a more advanced construct, not an animated object.

Granted a semblance of life through the use of rituals or other strange magic, animated objects take many forms and serve a variety of uses. A few examples of typical animated objects are listed below. Many of these creatures serve as guardians, surprising unsuspecting adventurers when they suddenly attack. Others serve as idle distractions for the exceptionally rich, simple servants created to handle odd jobs, and the like.
