As Zibik wanders the blighted wilderness and takes on the toxins of others, his body is overburdened by fungal growths. Zibik sheds these growths during his cycle of death and rebirth, and they sometimes emerge as a fungal creature that's independent of but innately connected to the green man. Zibik often shapes a speaker in spores to resemble an animal he encountered recently; speakers very rarely share the same form, but they all appear like fungal growths surrounded by glowing spores.
