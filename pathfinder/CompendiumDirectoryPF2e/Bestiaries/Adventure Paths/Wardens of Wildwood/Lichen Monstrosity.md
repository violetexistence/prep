    desc: "(3 actions) The lichen monstrosity uses 3 actions to move, traveling up to 30 feet with each action and dealing 2d10+10 bludgeoning damage. Each creature in its path must attempt a `DC 31 Reflex check` save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature takes half damage.\n\n**Failure** The creature takes full damage and is exposed to leechlichen.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and is exposed to leechlichen. The results of its saving throw against the leechlichen are treated as one step worse. Each successful check to disable this hazard reduces its movement by 30 feet, and the fourth success disables it completely."
