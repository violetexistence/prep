    desc: "  Tremorsense allows a monster to feel the vibrations through a solid surface caused by movement. It is an imprecise sense with a limited range (listed in the ability). Tremorsense functions only if the monster is on the same surface as the subject, and only if the subject is moving along (or burrowing through) the surface."

    desc: "  If Old Thornbarker dies unexpectedly before passing on their knowledge in a succession ritual, the amassed lore within their roots and boughs explodes out in a shock wave that deals 8d10 mental damage to creatures within 30 feet (`DC 32 Will check` save) before dissipating; those who fail also fall [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]."

    desc: "  Dozens of [[Rage of Elements/Wood Scamp|Wood Scamps]] clamber on, nest in, and flit around Old Thornbarker, feeding him their observations and gossip. The arboreal can grab a nearby scamp as if drawing a weapon, using it as a thrown weapon. The unlucky scamp impacts with a clatter of spines and toxic pollen, after which the dazed elemental scampers away to regain its senses.\n\nIf Old Thornbarker takes 40 or more damage from an area effect, the scamps scatter and seek cover for 1d6 rounds, during which time Old Thornbarker can't make scamp Strikes and loses all-around vision."

Male variant arboreal archive

Arboreal archives are solitary beings typically found in the remote wilderness. These ancient monoliths hold the memories of their vast territories, keeping mental records of the passing seasons of the world around them. Their knowledge of humanoid affairs varies, as they find quickly shifting political situations difficult to comprehend, but through fungal networks, reports from arboreal wardens, and other woodland chatter, arboreal archives learn of each storm, drought, or logging threat encountered throughout their long years. They primarily observe and record rather than interfere, but they willingly offer wisdom to those who respectfully seek them out. Arboreal regents call upon archives for advice in times of strife, conferring on the best course of action to protect their realms.

It is rare for there to be more than one arboreal archive in a given region. When an archive senses they're nearing the end of their lengthy lifespan, a grove of regents gathers to nominate the wisest among them to become the next archive. After four seasons' deliberation, all arboreals in the area congregate to witness the succession ritual, during which the elder arboreal archive transfers their collected wisdom to the elected replacement before retiring.

* * *

Arboreals are tree-like ancient guardians of forests, nurturing new growth and maintaining a balanced ecosystem as if the vast wilderness were their garden. Arboreals are thoughtful and deliberate - until something threatens their realms and invites their wrath.
