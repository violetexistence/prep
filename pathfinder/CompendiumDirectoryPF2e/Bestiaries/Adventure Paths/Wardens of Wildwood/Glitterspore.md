A creature that starts its turn in the aura must succeed at a `DC 23 Will check` save or become [[Conditions/Fascinated|Fascinated]] by the glitterspore for 1 round. This aura activates automatically when a glitterspore uses Plant Mimicry, and it deactivates when the glitterspore reverts to its natural form."

The glitterspore has an automatic result of 29 (33 in gardens, forests, or swamps) on Deception checks and DCs to pass as a non-creature plant. The glitterspore stays in this shape until it takes an action."

A glitterspore is a colony of mold spores that function as a mindless yet cunning conglomerate. Composed of razor-sharp spores that glitter hypnotically, this insidious fungus adopts the appearance of plants to lure in prey, altering its form and coloration to perfectly impersonate a variety of flora.

Ghorus designed glitterspores to be pernicious and deadly. They can gain sustenance from a variety of sources, including sunlight and soil, but their preferred food source is blood. When possible, glitterspores enter their prey through open orifices or by burrowing directly into their flesh. They then consume their prey from within, cutting through muscle and bone to bathe in blood.

## Living Legacy

While Ghorus and his followers are long dead, many of Ghorus's creations live on, including deadly plant creatures like the glitterspore, dangerous weapons, and—of course—ghorans. From the heart of the Verduran Forest, these successful creations and half-finished experiments have spread across Golarion.
