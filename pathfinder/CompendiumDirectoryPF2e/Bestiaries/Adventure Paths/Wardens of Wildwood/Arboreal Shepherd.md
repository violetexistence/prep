Shepherds develop an eccentric fascination with local fauna. These shepherds eagerly bear fruit to feed their friends, provide roosts for bats, and invite beasts to gnaw nesting niches directly into their trunks.

* * *

An arboreal's abilities gradually change as it grows, explores, and fulfills its forest's needs. After decades of life as an unremarkable tree, an arboreal sapling uproots itself to discover its greater purpose, often guided by elders.

## Occult Nutrients

While drawing water, nutrients, and trace primal energy from the soil, an arboreal sometimes absorbs psychic impressions that shape its growth. Taking root in haunted landscapes or abandoned fairgrounds can result in truly sinister or frolicsome arboreals.
