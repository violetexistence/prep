    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate) Alyce designates a single creature as her prey and focuses her attacks against that creature. She must be able to see, hear, or otherwise detect the prey, or she must be tracking the prey during exploration. She gains a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks when she Seeks her prey and a +2 circumstance bonus to Survival checks when she [[Actions/Track|Tracks]] her prey. Alyce also ignores the penalty for making ranged attacks within her second range increment against the prey she's hunting. Alyce can only have one creature designated as her prey at a time. If she uses Hunt Prey against a creature when she already has a creature designated, the prior creature loses the designation and the new prey gains the designation. Her designation lasts until her next daily preparations."

    desc: "`pf2:r`  **Requirements** Alyce is wielding a melee weapon\n\n**Trigger** A creature within Alyce's reach attempts to apply the [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]], [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]], or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]] condition to an ally\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Alyce makes a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If the attack is a hit, the triggering ally can immediately use a reaction to [[Actions/Escape|Escape]]. If the attack is a critical hit, any grabbed, immobilized, or restrained conditions imposed by the triggering action are negated."
