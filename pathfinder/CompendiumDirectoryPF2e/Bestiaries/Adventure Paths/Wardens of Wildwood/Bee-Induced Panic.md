    desc: "`DC 22 Diplomacy check` (expert) to calm the panicked crowd and guide them to safety, `DC 20 Medicine check` (trained) to attend to victims' injuries, or `DC 21 Nature check` (expert) to instruct the crowd on how best to protect themselves from bees. Alternatively, a PC able to communicate with insects can instead attempt a `DC 18 Diplomacy check` (trained) check to calm and redirect the bees. Three successful checks are required to completely disable the hazard. The hazard is automatically disabled after 5 rounds or once both swarms are defeated."
