    desc: "`pf2:r` **Trigger** Two or more living creatures enter the area\n* * *\n\n**Effect** A spiraling column of shadows and crackling planar magic gathers 20 feet away, becoming a whirling cyclone of darkness 15 feet wide and 100 feet tall. The trap then rolls initiative."

  - name: "Routine"
    desc: "(3 actions) The cyclone uses 3 actions to move, traveling up to 30 feet with each action and dealing 2d12+13 slashing damage to each creature in its path (`DC 33 Reflex check` save). A creature needs to attempt only one save during the cyclone's movement, even if the cyclone moves over its space more than once. On a critical failure, a creature is swept up into the cyclone, becoming [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] ([[Actions/Escape|Escape]] DC 33). A creature grabbed by the cyclone moves along with the cyclone and takes 1d12+7 additional slashing damage at the beginning of its turn, and it must attempt the basic Reflex save against the cyclone on the cyclone's turn, no matter where the cyclone moves. A creature that successfully Escapes from the cyclone falls from a height of 1d20 Ã— 5 feet."
