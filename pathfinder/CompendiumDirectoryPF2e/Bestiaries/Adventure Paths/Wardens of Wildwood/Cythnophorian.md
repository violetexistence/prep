In its natural state, a fully grown cythnophorian resembles a wriggling mass of tendrils and fibrous growths approximately the size of a house cat. Although fully capable of locomotion in this form, a cythnophorian is rarely encountered outside a host, typically a humanoid or animal corpse, which the creature burrows into and animates from within like a grisly flesh puppet. Once so ensconced, the cythnophorian seeks out new victims to infect with its noxious spores, seizing control of their bodies for its own ends until they succumb to the deadly toxin and become incubators for new cythnophorians.

A Medium-sized corpse is typically sufficient to sustain a cythnophorian for two weeks before it must seek out a fresh one. If unable to locate a new host in that time, the creature enters a dormant state, withdrawing into an unremarkable seed pod roughly the size of a child's fist, where it can lie in wait for years until a suitable victim presents itself.

## Unknown Origins

Opinions vary as to the exact nature of these creatures, with many scholars citing their similarities to the fungal parasites known as cythnigots as evidence of some qlippoth connection. Still others theorize that they began as a natural form of plant life that gradually became twisted and corrupted, deliberately or otherwise, by prolonged exposure to the foul energies of Cyth-V'sug, demon lord of fungus and rot.
