Some coniferous arboreals develop viscous sap that they use to trap trespassers. Dozens of half-hardened rivulets drip from their bark, ready to ensnare weapons or even capture airborne particles. Sapstrikers act as bounty hunters who delight in tracking down and punishing loggers.

* * *

An arboreal's abilities gradually change as it grows, explores, and fulfills its forest's needs. After decades of life as an unremarkable tree, an arboreal sapling uproots itself to discover its greater purpose, often guided by elders.

## Occult Nutrients

While drawing water, nutrients, and trace primal energy from the soil, an arboreal sometimes absorbs psychic impressions that shape its growth. Taking root in haunted landscapes or abandoned fairgrounds can result in truly sinister or frolicsome arboreals.
