    desc: "`pf2:1` (curse,emotion,mental,occult) The hateful logger vomits a stream of caustic black sludge at a single foe it can detect within 15 feet. The logger and the target each gain a +1 circumstance bonus on all attack rolls made against each other until the logger chooses a different target for its Vitriol. The target must attempt a `DC 19 Will check` save, with the following effects. The logger cannot use Vitriol again for 1d4 rounds.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** No effect.\n\n**Success** The target's mind is clouded by feelings of rage and hate, causing it to be [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] against the logger's next attack. It can't use actions with the concentrate trait unless they also have the rage trait.\n\n**Failure** As success, but the target is off-guard until the end of the logger's next turn. While off-guard, it is unable to use actions with the concentrate trait unless they also have the rage trait.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target is off-guard until the logger chooses a different target for its Vitriol."
