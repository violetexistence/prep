    desc: "`pf2:1`  The green man's vines leach away magic and transform it into life essence for the green man. On a successful vine Strike, the green man attempts to counteract one spell active on the target (typically one vexing the green man, or determined randomly if they aren't aware of specific effects), with a counteract rank of 10 and a modifier of +38.\n\nIf the effect is counteracted, the green man gains 30 temporary Hit Points that last for 10 minutes."

    desc: " (aura,fungus,primal) 120 feet.\n\nZibik constantly absorbs toxins and pathogens from his surroundings. Zibik automatically absorbs afflictions from non-creature plants, increasing his drained value by 1 each round he absorbs any afflictions from such plants (with no maximum). Living creatures in the area can attempt a saving throw against any disease or poison afflicting them each round, increasing their degree of success for the save by one step. If a creature succeeds, Zibik automatically counteracts the affliction and increases his current drained value by 1 (with no maximum).\n\nWhen Zibik removes an affliction with this ability, he automatically advances to Stage 1 of the affliction and must continue to attempt saving throws as normal. Zibik can choose to exclude any number of creatures in the area from this effect, and generally does so to absorb Ayrzul's Blight while allowing natural afflictions to run their course."

  - name: "Embed"
    desc: "  The green man's thorns embed themselves into any creature they damage, taking root into the ground. A target damaged by a thorn has its Speeds halved, and it can't Step, [[Actions/Fly|Fly]], [[Spells/Air Walk|Air Walk]], or otherwise leave the ground until the thorn is removed.\n\nRemoving a thorn requires 3 Interact actions, which don't have to be consecutive. If the creature performing the final action doesn't succeed at a `DC 45 Medicine check` check as part of that action, the target takes 10d6 untyped damage upon the thorn's removal."

  - name: "Focus Vines"
    desc: "`pf2:2`  The green man focuses all their vines against a single vexing foe, making a single vine Strike.\n\nOn a success, the target takes 5d10 additional damage and is affected by Absorb Magic three times. Even on a failure, the target takes the normal effects of a hit with a vine Strike, but on a critical failure, the vines miss completely."

  - name: "Fungal Rebirth"
    desc: " (fungus,primal) When Zibik dies as the result of a disease or his Aura of Absorption, fungus rebuilds his body over the course of 3d6 days. If his body is destroyed before then, the process restarts.\n\nWhen restored to life, he's bolstered by primal might; he gains a +3 circumstance bonus to saving throws against diseases for a number of weeks equal to the number of days it took his body to regrow, and he's unaffected by the drained condition for the same duration (though he can still gain the condition)."

  - name: "Purge Plaguebearers"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (fungus,primal) Zibik exudes a cloud of spores in a 30-foot-radius emanation. They cling to all creatures currently afflicted with any disease in the area. Afflicted creatures take 25d6 void damage with a `DC 48 Fortitude check` save.\n\nA creature that fails its save becomes [[Conditions/Doomed|Doomed 1]] for 1 minute and [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 3]]. Zibik can choose to exclude any number of creatures in the area from this effect.\n\nZibik can't use Purge Plaguebearers again for 1d4 rounds."

  - name: "Vine Forest"
    desc: "`pf2:2`  The green man lashes out with all six vines to attack many opponents. They make up to six vine Strikes, each against a different target; this counts as one attack for their multiple attack penalty, increasing only after all the attacks are made."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Improved Grab|Improved Grab]]"
    desc: "  **Requirements** The monster's last action was a successful Strike that lists Improved Grab in its damage entry, or the monster has a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]\n* * *\n\n**Effect** If used after a Strike, the monster attempts to [[Actions/grapple|grapple]] the creature using the body part it attacked with as a free action. This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead spend an action to use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

Male variant green man

Green men are ancient, enigmatic lesser deities of the primeval forests, living embodiments of nature and plantkind. When a forest or other woodland terrain generates enough nature spirits, beings of the same sort of vital essence that embodies leshys or answers the call of a commune with nature, they naturally coalesce together and apotheosize into a green man. Green men aren't concerned with all the multifarious processes of nature like Gozreh or many other nature deities. Instead, they focus nearly all their attention on the plants of their home, only concerning themselves with animals, minerals, and the like insomuch as they affect the plants. Despite their name, green men aren't necessarily male; as creatures of pure natural power, to many of them, the concept of gender holds no meaning, and to those that do, they can be of any gender.

Most green men are neutral and tend to ignore "animals," which to them include sapient creatures such as humans. However, good and evil green men do exist. These individuals are far more likely to attempt to spread their influence far and wide, either for good or ill. Good green men provide succor to all that come within their home, not only to plants, providing wisdom like a nurturing parent. Evil green men, however, allow rare and dangerous plants to thrive in their domains by spreading fear and devastation to all those who might threaten plant life, though they might keep a few animals around to hunt for sport.
