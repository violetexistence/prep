  - name: "Witness"
    desc: "  The eyelet records whatever it perceives, storing it in an embedded, marble-sized sensor. The eyelet can record up to 1 hour of events, starting and stopping across a longer period. Removing the sensor erases its records. An eyelet can transfer everything it has recorded up to 10 miles to its linked scrying station, where the recordings are collected and can be viewed. Doing so empties the sensor so it can be used again. An eyelet can link, or sever its link, to a scrying station as a 10-minute activity with the concentrate trait."

A solitary eyelet is of little threat and strives to operate in secret.

Eyelets are tiny, bat-like creatures with wings of shadow and magical scrying sensors embedded in their torsos. They use these eye-like sensors to record nearby events, gaining sustenance in the process.

## Scrying Station

Eyelets live in flocks, nesting at a central scrying station for safety and camaraderie. At these stations, the events the eyelets witness are stored and viewed, and the eyelets' scrying sensors are erased. Wild eyelets typically use abandoned buildings or sheltered cave systems as scrying stations. The eyelets in Gloaming Arbor work for Avathrael and are linked with the eyelet spire (area **T**).
