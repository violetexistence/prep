Spitting sawflies are enormous, bloated insects covered in tumor-like knots of spores. These ravenous pests sow disease and spores wherever they go, heralding the infestation of creeping cones.

The Plane of Wood contains many unique ecosystems formed around species of wondrous trees; when Ayrzul's Blight mutates one of these trees rather than killing it, it can have a cascading effect on the tree's biome. Multiple species often mutate in tandem, becoming warped mockeries and a vector for Ayrzul's Blight. These "blight bonded" creature families are parasites and predators and typically form twisted symbiotic relationships.
