Ohancanus are gigantic fey who delight in destruction. It's not necessarily the sadistic torment of others they enjoy, but living in a devastated landscape seems to bring them peace. Despite their destructive drive, ohancanus are like wildfires: their damage often clears the way for new growth.

Ohancanus resemble cyclopes, and they're covered in untamed hair. Scattered across their hirsute forms, each ohancanu has a few conspicuously white hairs. These are extremely sensitive and seem to anchor some part of an ohancanu's essence, wracking them with nausea and weakness if ever plucked.

Though they habitually raze wildernesses, ohancanus rely on old growth forests for reproduction. When an ohancanu grows old, their companions murder and dissect them, planting their organs among the roots of the oldest trees around. About a year later, some of these organs sprout into young ohancanus who tear themselves free and seek out companions. From their first moments they understand language and basic survival skills, suggesting each generation retains some portion of their butchered progenitors' memories.

## Riddles And Rage

Ohancanus delight in destroying wordplay almost as much as they love demolishing architecture. A clever riddle can captivate an ohancanu and even halt their rampage. However, such a tactic rarely provide more than a brief opportunity for escape; once an ohancanu solves the puzzle or grows frustrated, their destruction resumes.
