    desc: "`pf2:r` **Trigger** 1 round passes since both isqulugs in area **B6** are slain, or 10 rounds pass since they rolled initiative\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The isqulugs die horribly (if they're still alive), rent by clawed fey hands. Spectral fey pull at the other creatures in the caves, all of which must attempt a `DC 36 Fortitude check` save. The haunt then rolls initiative.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature is pulled 10 feet toward the standing stones.\n\n**Failure** The creature is pulled 15 feet toward the standing stones.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature is pulled 15 feet toward the standing stones, knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]], and takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage (in addition to any damage from the toxic water)."

    desc: "(1 action) Spectral fey cavort about the room. All creatures in the room are raked by ghostly claws and splashed with toxic water, taking 1d10+14 force + 2d10 acid damage (`DC 32 Reflex check` save). Creatures that critically fail their Reflex saves are pulled 10 feet toward the standing stones."
  - name: "Reset"
    desc: "The haunt deactivates after 1 minute. It re-forms every new moon. If all of the glyphs in area **B6** are restored—a process requiring 10 days of downtime and 10 successful `DC 36 Nature check` or `DC 36 Occultism check` checks—the haunt becomes permanently disabled and doesn't re-form."
