Variant cave bear

Larger, stronger, and far more aggressive than its smaller cousins, the cave bear is a behemoth that avoids civilized lands, preferring to dwell in remote places. As its name might suggest, the cave bear makes its den in natural caves, and like the grizzly bear, it is fiercely territorial. Unlike a grizzly bear, however, a cave bear is short tempered and will make sure its foe is dead before moving on, usually feasting on its prey's soft flesh once it has been incapacitated. Cave bears are often regarded as powerful guardian spirits by remotedwelling people, though they are also utilized as beasts of war by orcs or even giants. Stone giants in particular have an affinity for keeping trained cave bears as pets or guardians for their homes.

Bears are ferocious predators typically found in cold or temperate woodlands and hills. Many species of bear exist in addition to the two presented below, such as the smaller black bear or the arctic-dwelling polar bear.
