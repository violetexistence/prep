Young arboreals often appear lanky and uncoordinated. Their awkwardness belies their burgeoning strength and decades of natural studies.

* * *

An arboreal's abilities gradually change as it grows, explores, and fulfills its forest's needs. After decades of life as an unremarkable tree, an arboreal sapling uproots itself to discover its greater purpose, often guided by elders.

## Always Growing

An arboreal sapling gradually grows into a more powerful form, such as an arboreal warden, filling whatever niche suits its interests and environment. However, even centuries later, an arboreal can slowly reshape itself to fill a new role, such as a warden transforming into an arboreal regent after their predecessor's retirement.

## Occult Nutrients

While drawing water, nutrients, and trace primal energy from the soil, an arboreal sometimes absorbs psychic impressions that shape its growth. Taking root in haunted landscapes or abandoned fairgrounds can result in truly sinister or frolicsome arboreals.
