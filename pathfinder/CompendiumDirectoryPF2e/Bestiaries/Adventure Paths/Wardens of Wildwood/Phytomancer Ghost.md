On a failure, a creature becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] (or [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 3]] on a critical failure).

  - name: "Memory of Leaves"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (plant,primal,wood) The ghost mourns its verdant birthplace, creating a swirling cloud of phantom leaves as a 20-foot emanation until the end of its next turn. All creatures within the emanation become [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]], and all creatures outside the emanation become concealed to creatures within it. Creatures with the plant or wood traits ignore this concealment.\n\nThe ghost can't use Memory of Leaves again for 1d4 rounds."
