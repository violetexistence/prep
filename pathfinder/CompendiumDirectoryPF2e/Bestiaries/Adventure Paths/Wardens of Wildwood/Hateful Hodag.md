If the creature is knocked into a solid object, it takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage as well before landing prone. The hodag can instead toss a creature straight up in the air.

The target must attempt a `DC 22 Will check` save, with the following effects. The hodag cannot use Vitriol again for 1d4 rounds.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** No effect.\n\n**Success** The target's mind is clouded by feelings of rage and hate, causing it to be [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] against the hodag's next attack. It can't use actions with the concentrate trait unless they also have the rage trait.\n\n**Failure** As success, but the target is off-guard until the end of the hodag's next turn. While off-guard, it is unable to use actions with the concentrate trait unless they also have the rage trait.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target is off-guard until the hodag chooses a different target for its Vitriol."

Elite variant hodag

Because they are often described only in drunken retellings of loggers' or miners' tales, hodags are considered by many to exist only in the local folklore of remote areas. However, some individuals have actually encountered these dangerous beasts firsthand, and even fewer have lived to tell their tales.

Hodags are reptilian creatures the size of bulls. These vicious predators' long claws can tear creatures apart in seconds. Their backs sport dozens of long spines that run from their snouts all the way down the length of their powerful tails. Their wide mouths are full of sharp and twisted rows of teeth not unlike those of a shark. The hodags' rough, scaly hides carry hues of green and brown, allowing them to blend into their forest surroundings where they ambush prey. Only their glowing red eyes reveal their presence, though hodags have learned to use this to their advantage by drawing attention to their eyes in one area, then closing their eyes and stealthily moving to another area to cause their prey to misconstrue their location.

In the wintertime, when snow and ice blankets a region, hodags grow a foul-smelling coat of greasy, dark-brown fur that sprouts in tufts from between their scales. A typical hodag measures over 10 feet long from snout to tail and weighs upward of 700 pounds.
