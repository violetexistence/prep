Resembling twisted lumps of fused gravel with oddly angled crystal limbs, gritblights are shock troops commonly used by Ayrzul to spread terror and disease to his enemies. These creatures are the gruesome result of experiments on crystalline elementals who were once the allies or servants of Ayrzul's rival lord of elemental earth, Sairazul. Their crystalline body parts appear cracked and deformed, only their single "eye" left intact.
