If the pixie hits a creature with that arrow before the pixie's next turn, the arrow inflicts one of the following special effects instead of dealing damage. Each effect depends on the target's DC 24 Will save. On a critical hit, the target gets a result one degree worse than it rolled.\n\n*   Confusion (emotion, mental) (`DC 24 Will check`) The target suffers the effects of a 4th-rank confusion spell.\n*   Shadow Shroud (darkness, incapacitation) (`DC 24 Will check`) On a failed Will save, the target is enveloped in shadows. It perceives its surroundings as though bright light conditions were only dim light and dim light as though it was darkness.\n*   Supernatural Chill (cold, shadow) (`DC 24 Will check`) The target takes 5d6 cold damage (basic Fortitude save)."

Pixie

Insatiably curious, overly excitable, and just a bit puckish, pixies are wanderers and tricksters who use their pixie dust to create all sorts of whimsical situations, as well as to defend themselves. They take great pride in their skill at archery, even when not using their arrows to deliver magical ailments. They often practice by shooting drops of dew or severing vines and hairs. Other creatures often have trouble understanding a pixie's rapid, rambling way of speaking.

Elusive, flighty, and ebullient, sprites are what many villagers first imagine when they hear the terms "fey" or "fairy." While their dispositions vary, all sprites share a connection to magic and a diminutive size. This family of fey shares its name with its slightest and most populous member, the common sprite.
