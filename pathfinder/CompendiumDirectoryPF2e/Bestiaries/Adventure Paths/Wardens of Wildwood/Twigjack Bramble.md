    desc: "  **Thresholds** 68 (3 segments), 34 (2 segments)\n* * *\n\nTroops are composed of many individuals, represented by four \"segments\" on a battle grid. Each segment is 10 feet on each side and as tall as the individual members of the troop. Segments must remain contiguous. Each one has to share at least 5 feet of one of its edges with another segmentâ€”being adjacent on a diagonal isn't sufficient! You can measure flanking, cover, and the like using the center of any segment.\n\nA troop has two Hit Point thresholds in its HP entry and loses segments as it crosses thresholds. Typically, the higher threshold is at 2/3 of the troop's maximum Hit Points and the lower is at 1/3 of its maximum. Once the troop drops below the higher threshold, it loses one segment, leaving three segments (12 squares) remaining and setting the first threshold as the troop's new maximum Hit Points. This repeats when the troop drops below the lower threshold, leaving two segments (8 squares). At 0 Hit Points, the troop disperses entirely, with the few remaining members surrendering, [[Conditions/Fleeing|Fleeing]], or easily dispatched, as determined by the GM. Typically the creature who caused the troop to lose a segment decides which to remove, or the GM decides when a specific creature wasn't responsible. To restore lost segments and maximum Hit Points, a troop needs to spend downtime to use long-term treatment on casualties or recruit new members to replace the fallen.\n\nTroops are typically immune to non-damaging effects that target a single creature, such as a [[Spells/Charm|Charm]] spell or the [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] action. An ability that can target 5 or more creatures can target an entire segment, increasing to two segments if it can target 10 or more creatures and to the entire troop if it can target 20 or more creatures. An ability that affects all creatures in a certain range affects all segments in range (make any checks or saves separately for each segment). As examples, an 8th rank _charm_ spell (with 10 targets) can affect two segments, and an ability that Demoralizes all creatures within 30 feet of you would affect all segments that are fully within that range. A non-damaging ability that would prevent a segment from acting, cause them to flee, or otherwise make them unable to function as part of the troop for a round or more removes the segment entirely. The troop loses a number of HP required to bring it to the next threshold. If an ability both deals damage and has a non-damaging effect, apply the damage then the rest of the effect."

    desc: "`pf2:3`  The twigjack bramble swarms over any creatures in their path, shredding their foes with razor-sharp thorns. The bramble Forms Up and Strides twice, moving through the space of any Medium or smaller creatures. Each creature whose space the bramble moves through takes 4d6 slashing damage (`DC 21 Reflex check` save). On a critical failure, the creature is also knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]."

  - name: "Mass Bramble Jump"
    desc: "`pf2:3` (plant,primal,teleportation) The twigjack bramble uses Form Up to redistribute its squares into any configuration wherein all squares are in undergrowth, then instantly teleports to another square within 60 feet, using Form Up again on the target square. The configuration of the second Form Up must also place all of the bramble's squares in undergrowth. This movement doesn't trigger reactions."

  - name: "Rain of Splinters"
    desc: "`pf2:2`  The twigjack bramble launches a volley of splinters and brambles in a 10-foot burst within 30 feet that deals 4d6 piercing damage (`DC 21 Reflex check` save). When the bramble is reduced to 8 or fewer squares, this area decreases to a 5-foot burst."

  - name: "Troop Movement"
    desc: "  Whenever the twigjack bramble Strides, it first Forms Up as a free action to condense into a 20-foot-by-20-foot area (minus any missing squares), then moves up to its Speed. This works just like a Gargantuan creature moving; for instance, if any square of the bramble enters difficult terrain, the extra movement cost applies to the whole group."

A single twigjack is a dangerous and unpredictable creature with a capacity for sudden violence. A group of twigjacks united by shared purpose is a substantive force for destruction. The impetus behind the formation of a twigjack group, colloquially known as a "bramble," can be almost anything, although they nearly always form around a particularly charismatic or demagogic individual. Religious fanaticism is another common factor; notably, however, twigjacks rarely worship established deities and instead devote themselves to strange new gods of their own imagining who, inevitably, demand that their worshippers purge the twigjacks' territory of those whose presence displeases them.

## Proactive Vigilantes

Twigjacks frequently justify their violent and antisocial tendencies by declaring themselves the guardians of the forests in which they dwell, and that their duty is to keep those protected lands free of non-fey intruders by any means necessary. Rarely patient enough to wait for opportunities to come to them, roving brambles of twigjacks often seek out what they consider to be impending conflicts between forest-folk and outside threats in order to impose their "assistance," nearly always resulting in brutality and bloodshed that benefits neither side and only serves to escalate the situation.
