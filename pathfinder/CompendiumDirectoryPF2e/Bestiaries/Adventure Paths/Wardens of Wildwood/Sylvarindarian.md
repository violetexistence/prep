If he hits a creature with that arrow before his next turn, the arrow inflicts one of the following special effects of his choice instead of dealing damage. Each effect depends on the result of the target's attempt at a DC 25 Will save. On a critical hit, the target gets a result one degree worse than it rolled.\n\n*   **Charm** (emotion, incapacitation, mental) (`DC 25 Will check`)The arrow has the effect of a [[Spells/Charm|Charm]] spell, except the target doesn't gain a bonus to its save if the only hostile act was Sylvarindarian firing his bow, and he can choose to direct the target's adoration toward another creature rather than himself.\n*   **Memory Loss** (mental) (`DC 25 Will check`) On a failed Will save, the target loses the last 5 minutes of its memory.\n*   **Subdual** (mental, nonlethal) The target takes 6d6 mental damage, depending on the result of its `DC 25 Will check` save."

Male pixie

Insatiably curious, overly excitable, and just a bit puckish, pixies are wanderers and tricksters who use their pixie dust to create all sorts of whimsical situations, as well as to defend themselves. They take great pride in their skill at archery, even when not using their arrows to deliver magical ailments. They often practice by shooting drops of dew or severing vines and hairs. Other creatures often have trouble understanding a pixie's rapid, rambling way of speaking.

Elusive, flighty, and ebullient, sprites are what many villagers first imagine when they hear the terms "fey" or "fairy." While their dispositions vary, all sprites share a connection to magic and a diminutive size. This family of fey shares its name with its slightest and most populous member, the common sprite.
