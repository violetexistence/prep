Lagofirs are semiaquatic omnivores that resemble a rabbit the size of a large dog. They're social creatures, playful but territorial and protective of their kin. Lagofirs live in family units and gather in larger groups as often as their environment allows. They're commonly found in northern Avistan, congregating along rivers, lakes, and coasts, where they subsist on fish, crustaceans, marine plants, and small mammals.

Lagofirs have a stout body, rounded back, large hind legs, long ears, and a short, fluffy tail. Their powerful incisors are capable of cracking through clam shells, chitin, and bone. Both their front and back paws are webbed, and their front paws are highly dexterous, enabling them to grasp objects and perform simple manual tasks.

Lagofirs secrete a thick, sweet-smelling, flammable oil that coats their fur. Warm to the touch, this oil keeps them insulated and comfortable in frigid water and cold climates. Lagofirs mark their territory by brushing against solid surfaces, coating them in oil that, to other lagofirs, identifies an individual. This makes their lairs, known as burrows or forms, incredibly hazardous. A single spark in a lagofir form can cause an explosion.
