    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate) The commando designates a single creature they can see and hear, or one they're Tracking, as their prey. The commando gains a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to [[Actions/Seek|Seek]] their prey and to Survival checks to [[Actions/Track|Track]] their prey. The first time the commando hits their designated prey in a round, they deal an additional 1d8 precision damage. The commando also ignores the penalty for making ranged attacks within the second range increment when attacking their prey. These effects last until the commando uses Hunt Prey again."
