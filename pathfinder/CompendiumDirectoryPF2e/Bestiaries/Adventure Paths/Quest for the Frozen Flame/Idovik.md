Idovik teleports to a space adjacent to Ashen Swale, then shields Ashen Swale with his body. Idovik becomes the target of the triggering Strike."

    desc: "  Idovik is even older and more powerful than most Sarkorian gods, and he knows how to manifest in some forms without a god caller at all. Idovik does not share an initiative, actions, Hit Points, or a multiple attack penalty with Ashen Swale."

  - name: "Indomitable Step"
    desc: "  Idovik ignores difficult terrain and uneven ground, and he treats greater difficult terrain as normal difficult terrain."

  - name: "Otherworldly Roar"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (auditory) Idovik unleashes a powerful squeal while stomping his hooves and displaying his tusks. Idovik attempts Intimidate checks to [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] each foe within 30 feet. These checks take no penalty for not sharing a language."

  - name: "Rampaging Charge"
    desc: "`pf2:2`  Idovik rushes forward, using his momentum to power his attack. Idovik Strides twice and then makes a tusk Strike. As long as he moved at least 20 feet, he gains a +2 circumstance bonus to his attack roll. A Medium or smaller creature struck by this attack must succeed at a `DC 25 Reflex check` save or be knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] by the force of the blow."

  - name: "Spirit Link"
    desc: "  Even if his link is unusual, Idovik is bound to his summoner; he must remain within 100 feet of Ashen Swale at all times. If he ever moves outside this range or is reduced to 0 Hit Points, Idovik's physical form dissolves. Because his link functions unusually and he does not share Hit Points with Ashen Swale, Idovik remains manifested when Ashen Swale is [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]] or dead, as long as he stays near Ashen Swale's body. If Ashen Swale dies, Idovik's form fades away over the next minute. When unmanifested, Idovik must be manifested before he can reappear."
