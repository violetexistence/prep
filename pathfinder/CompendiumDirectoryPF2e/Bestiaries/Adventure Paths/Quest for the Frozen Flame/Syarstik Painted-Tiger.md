    desc: "  Syarstik can't leave Red Cat Cave, and he rarely ever leaves area **E9**\n* * *\n\nA typical ghost can stray only a short distance from where it was killed or the place it haunts. A typical limit is 120 feet. Some ghosts are instead bound to a room, building, item, or creature that was special to it rather than a location."

  - name: "Awaken Painting"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (divine) Syarstik animates a cave painting within 60 feet for 10 minutes. The painting's movement mimics Syarstik's, so the connection between the ghost and the awakened painting is obvious. Creatures other than Syarstik within 10 feet of the awakened painting are [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] because of these eerie movements. Syarstik can make ghostly fangs Strikes at any creature within 10 feet of a cave painting; the target's cover or concealment from the cave painting, rather than from Syarstik, applies to this Strike.\n\nA creature adjacent to an awakened painting can spend 2 actions to attempt a `DC 18 Occultism check` or `DC 18 Religion check` check (to compel the awakened painting to abate) or a `DC 20 Crafting check` or `DC 20 Thievery check` check (to thoroughly smear the cave painting). On a success, the painting is destroyed, and the animation ceases. Either way, this activity has the concentrate trait.\n\nDestroying three awakened paintings quells Syarstik's anger, causing the great cat to cease his attacks."

    desc: "`pf2:1`  Syarstik Strides and makes a Strike at the end of that movement. If he began this action [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]], he remains hidden until after this ability's Strike."
