    desc: "`pf2:1`  The frost giant gatebreaker breathes on the blade of their battleaxe, coating it in a layer of magical ice. For 1 minute, the frost giant's battleaxe Strikes gain the cold trait, and creatures struck by the battleaxe are [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]]; at the end of each of their turns, the slowed creature can attempt a `DC 23 Fortitude check` save to end the condition."

    desc: "`pf2:3`  **Requirements** Another frost giant gatebreaker has Readied to Stride on the frost giant gatebreaker's order\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The two frost giants Stride, with a maximum distance equal to the slowest giant's Speed. Every creature whose space they move through takes 2d8+9 bludgeoning damage (`DC 23 Reflex check`); creatures who fail their save fall [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]. At the end of their movement, the giants make a single Strike with a +20 modifier (reach 15 feet), inflicting 4d6+16 bludgeoning damage on a hit and knocking the target prone. If the giants hit, they can immediately attempt to Shove the creature as a free action."
