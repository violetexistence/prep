Powerful and swift land mammals, elk range through the plains, hills, and forests of the wilderness.

Their size, strength, and antlers (for the males) enable common elk to contend with most of their environment's dangers, though herds generally favor flight over combat. Most elk stand between 3 and 5 feet tall and weigh between 350 and 550 pounds, with females slighter than the males.
