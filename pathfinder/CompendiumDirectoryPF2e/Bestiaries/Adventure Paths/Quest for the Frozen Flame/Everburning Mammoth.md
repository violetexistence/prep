This requires an `Athletics check` check against the victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The victim is [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]], and the everburning mammoth regains 15 healing HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the everburning mammoth but increases the victim's drain value by 1."

It can attempt a new save at the end of each of its turns, and the DC cumulatively decreases by 1 on each such save."
