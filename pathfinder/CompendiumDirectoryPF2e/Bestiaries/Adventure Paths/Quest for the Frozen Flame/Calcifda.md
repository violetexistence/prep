  - name: "Coal Curse"
    desc: " (curse,primal) Wounds dealt by Calcifda's claws stiffen flesh and turn the blood that runs from them into tar. Each time a creature is damaged by Calcifda's claw Strike, it must succeed at a `DC 29 Fortitude check` save or become permanently [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] (slowed 2 on a critical failure) as its flesh stiffens like stone. If a creature is reduced to 0 Hit Points from Calcifda's claw Strike and fails the saving throw against coal curse, it's petrified and turned to coal. A creature that spends 8 hours in direct sunlight can attempt a new saving throw to remove the effects of coal curse, even if it has been petrified."
