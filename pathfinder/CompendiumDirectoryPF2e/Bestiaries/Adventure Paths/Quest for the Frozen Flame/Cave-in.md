    desc: "`pf2:r` **Trigger** A creature moves into the unstable tunnel\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The tunnel collapses in a cave-in that deals 4d8+10 bludgeoning damage to the triggering creature and all creatures in area **A2** (`DC 21 Reflex check`). On a failed save, the triggering creature is [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] ([[Actions/escape dc=21|escape dc=21]]). This collapse fully blocks the tunnel (area **A2**), making it impassable."
