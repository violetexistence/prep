  - name: "Tied to the Land"
    desc: "  A summer hora queen is intrinsically tied to a specific region, such as a forest or hilly plain. For 3 months around the summer solstice, the environment is supernaturally resilient, allowing the queen to automatically attempt to counteract spells and rituals that would harm the environment, such as [[Spells/Blight|Blight]], with a +27 counteract modifier and a counteract rank of 7. For the 3 months around the winter solstice, however, her warded region becomes twisted or unhealthy unless a winter hora queen is present."

  - name: "[[Creature Family Ability Glossary/(Nymph Queen) Change Shape|Change Shape]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (polymorph,primal) Nymph queens can transform between their original form, which looks much like a typical nymph of their kind, and any Small or Medium humanoid form, typically choosing a more humanoid-looking version of their natural form.\n* * *\n\nThe monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

  - name: "Focus Beauty"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (emotion,incapacitation,mental,primal,visual) The hora queen focuses her beauty upon a target within her aura. The creature must attempt a Will save. On a failure, it is affected as if by the hora queen's nymph's beauty aura; if it was already affected by the aura, it's [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] until its sight is restored via restore senses or similar effect, or until the hora queen chooses to remove the effect using a single action, which has the concentrate trait. A hora queen can Focus Beauty on a given creature only once per turn."

  - name: "[[Creature Family Ability Glossary/(Nymph Queen) Inspiration|Inspiration]]"
    desc: "`pf2:3` (emotion,mental,primal) A nymph queen can inspire a single intelligent creature by giving that creature a token of her favor, typically a lock of her hair. As long as the creature carries her token and remains in good standing with the nymph queen, the creature gains a +1 status bonus to all Crafting checks, Performance checks, and Will saves.\n\nIf a nymph queen grants her Inspiration to a bard and the nymph queen is that bard's muse, the bard gains an additional benefit depending on their muse theme: for lore muse, the bard also gains a +1 status bonus to all Lore checks; for maestro muse, the status bonus to Performance checks increases to +2 for the purpose of determining the effects of compositions; for polymath muse, the bard gains a +4 status bonus to untrained skill checks; and for all other muses, the Will save bonus increases to +2 against fey.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Nymph Queen's Inspiration|Effect: Nymph Queen's Inspiration]]"

  - name: "Summer's Salvation"
    desc: "`pf2:r`  **Trigger** The summer hora or an ally within 30 feet that the summer hora can see fails a Perception check, saving throw, attack roll, or skill check.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** If it's the month of the summer solstice, the hora's or ally's check retroactively gains a +4 status bonus, which can change the outcome from a critical failure to a failure or a failure to a success. If it's the month before or after the summer solstice, the check gains a retroactive +2 status bonus instead. In the other months except during the three winter solstice months, the check gains a retroactive +1 status bonus instead. During the winter solstice months, this ability has no effect. The summer hora can't use Summer's Fortune again for 1d4 rounds."
