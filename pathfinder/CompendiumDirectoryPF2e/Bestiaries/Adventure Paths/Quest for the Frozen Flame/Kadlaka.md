    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,polymorph,primal) The kadlaka can change their appearance to that of a Medium humanoid. This doesn't change their Speed or their attack and damage modifiers with their Strikes but might change the type of damage their melee Strikes deal (typically to bludgeoning). While in their humanoid shape, the kadlaka can't use Wingbeat. Each kadlaka has a fixed humanoid form-they can't adopt a different appearance each time they use this ability.\n* * *\n\nThe monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

  - name: "Silent Lightning"
    desc: " (illusion,primal) A kadlaka's movements are practically silent. Against a creature using only hearing to perceive them, they gain a +4 circumstance bonus to their Stealth check. As normal, this benefit also improves the kadlaka's Stealth DC."

  - name: "Wingbeat"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (primal,sonic) The kadlaka beats their wings with a mighty peal of thunder. Creatures in a 15-foot emanation take 5d6 sonic damage (`DC 21 Fortitude check`). On a failed save, the creature is also pushed 5 feet away from the kadlaka.\n\nThe kadlaka can't use Wingbeat again for 1d4 rounds."

Kadlakas-strong, lanky humanoids with raven-like features-combine the most formidable aspects of talented hunters and airborne scouts, to say nothing of their potent magical powers over thunder and lightning. Though they shy from most humanoids, kadlakas readily form friendships with ravens and other birds, and they sometimes make temporary alliances with people who prove themselves capable stewards of wild animals and the natural order of things. When they do settle on a roost-whether for a single season or a lifetime-kadlakas often position themselves as guardians of a natural feature or local flock. Because a kadlaka's natural form might frighten humanoid travelers, they often take on the guise of a human or other common bipedal ancestry to gain information and pass on warnings.
