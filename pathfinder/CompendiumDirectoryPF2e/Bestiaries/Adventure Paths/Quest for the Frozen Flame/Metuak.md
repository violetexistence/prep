    desc: "  A demon named Xeleria is bound to Metuak's soul. Though the two entities share one body and are a single creature for the purpose of both targeted and area effects, Metuak and Xeleria each have 120 Hit Points. Damage to each is tracked separately. Xeleria's HP is reduced by force, good, and vitality damage, and any damage from a cold iron weapon, a weapon with a _ghost touch_ rune, and any damage originating from the _Primordial Flame_. All other damage reduces Metuak's HP.Metuak and Xeleria must both be reduced to 0 HP for Metuak to die and Xeleria to be destroyed. If, at the beginning of Metuak's turn, either Metuak or Xeleria has been reduced to 0 HP but the other hasn't, Metuak and Xeleria each regain 15 HP."
