    desc: "A successful `DC 22 Athletics check`, `DC 22 Nature check`, or `DC 22 Survival check` check from an adjacent square is sufficient to smother one 5‑foot‑square of fire; each attempt is an Interact action. Dousing the flames automatically extinguishes one or more sections of fire, with no check. Water typically clears a 5‑foot square if the amount is small (such as from a spell like create water or hydraulic push). Larger amounts of water, such as a full bucket, typically douse a 10‑foot‑by‑10‑foot area (or 4 squares in some other shape). Throwing a bucket of water on flames requires an Interact action. A waterskin doesn't contain enough water to put out even 1 square of fire. Cold can also put out fire, but only if the cold can affect an area; cold is less effective than water, so a frost vial puts out only 1 square of fire, and a ray of frost is ineffective."

    desc: "On its turn, the fire spreads into a number of additional squares equal to half the number of squares the fire currently occupies (minimum 1 square). You determine the squares the fire spreads into. Any creature that ends its turn next to the flames takes 2d8+5 fire damage, or 4d8+10 fire damage if it ended its turn within the flames (`DC 25 Reflex check` in either case). A creature can take damage from the forest fire only once per round."
