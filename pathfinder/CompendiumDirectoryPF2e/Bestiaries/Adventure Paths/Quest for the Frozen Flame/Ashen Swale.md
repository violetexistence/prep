    desc: "`pf2:2` (concentrate,incapacitation,manipulate,primal) Ashen Swale seizes control of the body of a creature within 30 feet that is dead or [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]]. The target must attempt a Will save. Dead creatures automatically fail this save. On a success, the target is permanently immune to Corpse Puppet. On a failure, the target is controlled by Ashen Swale. It gains the minion trait and can act as though it were alive and conscious as long as it's controlled by Ashen Swale. Controlling each target requires Ashen Swale to take an action to Command a Minion. The only actions the target can take during this time are Interact, Stride, and Strike.\n\nAshen Swale retains control of the target for 10 minutes. This control ends immediately if the target loses the unconscious condition or the target is dealt an additional 50 damage since Ashen Swale took control (which destroys the body completely). After he has lost control of a target, that target is permanently immune to Corpse Puppet.\n\nAshen Swale can control up to two targets with Corpse Puppet at a time."

    desc: "`pf2:3` (concentrate,magical,manipulate,teleportation) Ashen Swale summons Idovik in an adjacent open space. If Idovik was already manifested, Ashen Swale chooses whether to unmanifest Idovik or to teleport Idovik to an adjacent open space. If Idovik unmanifested at 0 Hit Points, this process takes 1 minute instead of 3 actions, but Idovik regains 1 Hit Point when he remanifests."
