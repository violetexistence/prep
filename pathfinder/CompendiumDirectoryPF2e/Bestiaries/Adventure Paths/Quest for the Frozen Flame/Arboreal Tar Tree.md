    desc: " (primal) A living arboreal or animated tree slain by a tar tree's thorny branch Strike rises as a tar tree spawn after 1d4 rounds. This tar tree spawn is under the command of the tar tree that killed it. It doesn't have primal innate spells or the spawn tar tree ability and becomes [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 2]] for as long as it's a tar tree spawn. If the creator of the tar tree spawn dies, the tar tree spawn becomes a full-fledged, autonomous tar tree; it regains its free will, gains primal innate spells and the spawn tar tree ability, and is no longer clumsy."
