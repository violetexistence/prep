    desc: "  An hora is mystically bonded to a natural location with a simple astronomical calendar that marks the summer and winter solstice. If they aren't at that location at dawn when the sunlight touches the calendar, they become [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]], increasing the value by 1 for each missed day and reducing by 1 only when they witness dawn's light touch the calendar. Even on a cloudy day, there's enough sunlight to satisfy the hora's need. An hora can perform a 24-hour ritual to bond to a new location."

    desc: "`pf2:r`  **Trigger** The summer hora or an ally within 30 feet that the summer hora can see fails a Perception check or saving throw\n* * *\n\n**Effect** If it's the month of the summer solstice, the hora's or ally's check retroactively gains a +4 status bonus, which can change the outcome from a critical failure to a failure or a failure to a success. If it's the month before or after the summer solstice, the check gains a retroactive +2 status bonus instead. In the other months except during the three winter solstice months, the check gains a retroactive +1 status bonus instead. During the winter solstice months, this ability has no effect. The summer hora can't use Summer's Fortune again for 1d4 rounds."
