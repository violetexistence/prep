On a critical success, it also pulls out one of the target's teeth.\n\nIf the creature loses a tooth, it takes a –1 status penalty to Charisma-based skill checks and must succeed at a `DC 5 Flat check` to Cast a Spell unless that spell has the subtle trait. These effects last for 1 day, or until the stolen tooth is returned and the target regains at least 1 Hit Point.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Tooth Tug|Effect: Tooth Tug]]"

Variant tooth fairy

Lone fairies usually need several minutes of elbow grease and a sleeping or restrained subject to extract a tooth.

* * *

Tooth fairies spawn when a child's tooth (or, less commonly, an entire child) is buried in terrain rife with fey energies. Hatching from the buried teeth like larvae from an egg, tooth fairies build crude pliers from whatever they can find, then go hunting for more teeth—regardless of the owners' willingness.
