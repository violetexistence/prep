If the Strike hits and deals damage, he can attempt two additional melee Strikes with his other arms against two other creatures within his reach; each of the three Strikes must target a different creature.

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."
