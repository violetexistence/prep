Variant floodslain

The sudden, crashing waters of the Deluge kill many creatures in Belkzen each year. The surprise and terror these victims of the Deluge feel during their last moments is sometimes enough to raise them from the dead as floodslain. As the waters that killed them recede, the undead seek others to join them. Despite their broken, shattered bodies, floodslain are often recognizable to those who knew them in life.

Floodslain creatures are rare outside Belkzen, leading some scholars to speculate that the waters of the Deluge are somehow cursed. Others believe the proximity of Gallowspire could be the cause. If so, this means the Gravelands could soon see floodslain arise there too, as the Whispering Tyrant furthers his plots after escaping that prison.

## Panicked Eyes

One distinctive feature all floodslain share are their wide, panic-stricken eyes. A floodslain's gaze is permanently frozen in the expression of terror the creature felt moments before its death. Some floodslain are rumored to have the ability to spread this fear to others with a mere glance.

## In Search of Water

Floodslain tend to move toward lower ground, instinctively seeking water. Belkzen's flat floodplains, however, mean that the creatures wander in unpredictable ways. A common saying among old orc crafters is "build on high, keep dry," but many add "build low, the dead flow."
