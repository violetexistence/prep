## Orc Duels

Dueling is a frequent practice among many cultures of Golarion, and orcs are no exception. The lethality of these duels varies based on the duel's impetus—a friendly bout goes to first blood or until a combatant is knocked out, while a fight in response to a vendetta or insult is more likely to the death. Unlike in many dueling traditions, spectators are encouraged to verbally aid combatants, shouting out encouragement to one's preferred fighter and invectives to their opponent.
