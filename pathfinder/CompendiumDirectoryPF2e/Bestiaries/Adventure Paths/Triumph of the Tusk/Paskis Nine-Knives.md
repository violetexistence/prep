    desc: "`pf2:r`  **Trigger** A foe within Paskis's reach critically fails a Strike against her\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Paskis can Step; she must end her movement within reach of the triggering foe. Paskis then makes a melee Strike against the triggering creature, treating them as [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] for the attack. This Strike uses the triggering Strike's damage rather than that of Paskis's weapon. If the weapon has the agile or finesse train, Paskis also applies her [[Actions/Sneak|Sneak]] Attack to this damage."

This counts as a single melee attack for the purposes of Feinting."

In addition, her sneak attacks against her mark deal an additional 2 precision damage."
