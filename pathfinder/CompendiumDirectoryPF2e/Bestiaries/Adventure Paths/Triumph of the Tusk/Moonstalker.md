The most tenacious hunters of the Lyrune-Quah track and kill nocturnal beasts under the light of the moon. When such a warrior perishes during the hunt, sometimes their spirit lingers and transforms into a specter of the night, refusing to move on until their prey is slain.

## Loyal in Death

Though moonstalkers retain few memories of life, their connections to their quah resonate with them even after their demise. Moonstalkers have been seen protecting living Shoanti warriors who make camp within their hunting grounds, especially warbands that show reverence for the hunt. Outsiders are rarely, if ever, extended the same courtesy.
