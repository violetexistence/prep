The creature attempts a `DC 25 Fortitude check` save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target shakes the mold off and is unaffected.\n\n**Success** A small patch of mold clings to the target and deals 2d10+9 piercing damage.\n\n**Failure** The mold clings to the target. The target takes 4d10+18 piercing damage and is [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]].\n\n**Critical Failure** The mold envelops the target. As failure, except the target is also [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] until it's healed to its Hit Point maximum.\n\n_Note: A DC was not provided for this ability by Paizo. The DC present here is a hard DC for the hazard level according to the GM Core hazard building Tables._"
