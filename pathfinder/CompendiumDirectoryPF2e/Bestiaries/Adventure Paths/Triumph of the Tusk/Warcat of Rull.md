Belkzen's megafauna husbandry is a source of orc pride, with many species bred for everyday life. In battle, they provide an edge against foes.

## Apex Predator

The warcat of Rull is a stealthy predator that roams a large territory, hunting alone or with a mate. Even when nursing cubs, warcats hunt for themselves and teach their cubs to be self-sufficient. Warcats fear no challenge, preying on megafauna, giants, and even young dragons.
