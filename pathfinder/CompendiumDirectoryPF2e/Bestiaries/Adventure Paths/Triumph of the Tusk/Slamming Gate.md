    desc: "`pf2:r` **Trigger** Pressure is placed on the associated floor tile\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The door falls, closing off the hallway. The door deals 3d8+3 bludgeoning damage and 3d8+3 piercing damage to anyone beneath or adjacent to the door when it falls, and it pushes them out of its space (away from the door, or in a random direction if the creature is directly beneath the door) as it falls. A creature that succeeds at a `DC 22 Reflex check` save takes no damage and moves out of the way in a random direction. On a critical success, they choose the direction.\n\nLifting the closed door requires a successful `DC 25 Athletics check` check. Hitting the floor panels triggers the trap. The slab uses the same AC and saves as the trap, but it has Hardness 8 and 60 HP (BT 30)."
