The elite hunters of an orc hold often operate alone, venturing into the wilderness of Belkzen for weeks at a time to track and bring down dangerous wildlife. They don't necessarily limit themselves to hunting animals, making them excellent bounty hunters, as their skills are just as useful against humanoids.

While some orc warriors specialize in a technique of their hold, others synthesize styles from all over into a unified yet versatile technique.

## Hunting Trophies

Orc hunters frequently take bone fragments from megafauna or powerful opponents they slay as trophies. To show off their combat skill, they display these bones by inlaying them in armor or weapons, forming intricate patterns that provide an account of that orc's triumphs in battle for those who know how to read them.

## Orc Duels

Dueling is a frequent practice among many cultures of Golarion, and orcs are no exception. The lethality of these duels varies based on the duel's impetusâ€”a friendly bout goes to first blood or until a combatant is knocked out, while a fight in response to a vendetta or insult is more likely to the death. Unlike in many dueling traditions, spectators are encouraged to verbally aid combatants, shouting out encouragement to one's preferred fighter and invectives to their opponent.
