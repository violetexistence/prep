  - name: "Walk the Ethereal Line"

  - name: "Atonement for the Damned"
    desc: "  PCs might try to calm the phantoms instead of destroying them. At the GM's discretion, the PCs may attempt skill checks to talk down the spirits. On a success, the phantom's AC lowers by 2 as they become more willing to move on from their shame and dishonor, and they might even waver in attacking the PCs. Spells or rituals like [[Spells/Atone|Atone]] that require penitent creatures have no effect on these phantoms."

  - name: "Ectoplasmic Bleed"
    desc: "  If a creature hits the phantom with a melee Strike, the creature is splashed with ectoplasm, taking 2d4+7 spirit damage (`DC 21 Reflex check` save). On a failure, the creature is also [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]]."

  - name: "Susceptible to Death"
    desc: "  Though phantoms aren't alive, neither are they undead, and they are uniquely vulnerable to the effects of death. A phantom whose Hit Points are reduced to 0 as a result of a death effect (such as from a spell like [[Spells/Execute|Execute]]) is immediately whisked away to the River of Souls, where their soul resumes the usual path to afterlife."

When the One Eye Hold betrayed Diskah Night Watcher, the dying shaman's anguish rippled out and bound the spirits of the traitors to the Ethereal Plane.
