The zealot can't use Spellsmash again until they recharge it with a single action, which has the concentrate trait."

Deathless zealots are powerful variants of deathless acolytes. They're as ambitious as deathless hierophants but more martially oriented, seeking out and slaying alleged heretics and enemies of their faith in pursuit of completing their divine missions. This zealot is dedicated to Zagresh, but any deity of warfare could create a deathless zealot. Due to their focus on battle and conflict, orc deities are especially likely to create deathless zealots in preference to other forms of deathless acolytes.

## War's Toll

In the wake of the War of Immortals, deathless acolytes of all types have grown in number, especially deathless zealots, as both deities and their followers fell in battle without completing divine mandates. Curiously, deathless zealots of slain deities retain their power and continue to roam, still striving to ca rry out missions granted to them by their lost patrons.
