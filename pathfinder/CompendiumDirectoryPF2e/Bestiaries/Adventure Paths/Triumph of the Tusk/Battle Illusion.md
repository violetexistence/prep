    desc: "`pf2:r` (illusion, incapacitation, mental, occult, visual) **Trigger** Two or more creatures enter the haunt's area\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Each creature sees the forms of nearby allies shift and fade, replaced with hostile One Eye orcs. Each creature in the area must attempt a `DC 30 Will check` save. The haunt then rolls initiative.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature sees through the illusions and is temporarily immune to the haunt's routine for 1 minute.\n\n**Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Failure** The creature believes the illusions are true; if they become [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]] by the haunt's routine, they can't attempt flat checks to end the confused condition when they take damage.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure and the creature is filled with feelings of abandonment and betrayal. When the creature rolls against the haunt's routine, they must roll twice and take the worse result. This is a misfortune effect."

  - name: "Routine"
    desc: "(1 action; illusion, incapacitation, mental, occult) The haunt continues the illusion, making victims feel as though they've been abandoned and are surrounded by attackers on all sides. Each creature in the haunt's area must make a `DC 28 Will check` save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected and temporarily immune for 1 minute.\n\n**Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]] for 1 round.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature is hostile toward the supposed One Eye orcs and must spend all actions moving toward and attacking One Eye orcs. This hostility lasts for 1 minute, until the haunt is disabled, or until they fall [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]]. They cannot voluntarily stop attacking those they perceive as enemies."
  - name: "Reset"
    desc: "The haunt deactivates 1 minute after all creatures leave the Shadefields but resets immediately. The battle illusion resets 1 day after being disabled if the ancestor storm isn't put to rest."
