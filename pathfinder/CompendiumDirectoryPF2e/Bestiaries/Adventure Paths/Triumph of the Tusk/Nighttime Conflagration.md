    desc: "(1+ actions) Each square of flames spreads to an adjacent square, taking one action per square. Creatures adjacent to the fire take 3d6 fire damage each round from the heat (`DC 30 Fortitude check` save); a creature who fails their save is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] by the smoke ([[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]] on a critical failure). If there are more than 10 active squares of flames, creatures adjacent to the fire instead take 6d6 fire damage each round (`DC 30 Fortitude check` save), and a creature who fails their save is sickened 2 ([[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 3]] on a critical failure). A creature standing in the flames takes 12d6 fire damage each round (`DC 30 Reflex check` save); a creature who fails their save also takes 4d6 persistent fire damage."
