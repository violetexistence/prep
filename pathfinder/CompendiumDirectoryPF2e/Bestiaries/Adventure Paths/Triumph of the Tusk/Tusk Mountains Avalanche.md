All creatures on the ground within a 200-foot radius must attempt `DC 30 Reflex check` saves.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature takes no damage.\n\n**Success** The creature takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage and 4d6 cold damage.\n\n**Failure** The creature is swept away, moving 200 feet down the mountainside, and takes 8d6 bludgeoning damage and 8d6 cold damage.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature is also buried, taking an additional 2d6 bludgeoning damage and then 1d6 cold damage per minute of burial.
