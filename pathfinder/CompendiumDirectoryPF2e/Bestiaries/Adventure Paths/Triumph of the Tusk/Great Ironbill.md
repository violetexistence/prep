The great ironbill, a stork-like creature native to Dirt Sea shores, is known for clapping its fearsome beak to create incredibly loud and unnerving sounds.

Belkzen's megafauna husbandry is a source of orc pride, with many species bred for everyday life. In battle, they provide an edge against foes.

## Living Alarm

The great ironbill tends to remain eerily still, making it hard to spot when it stands amongst trees or shadows. Combined with their deafeningly loud calls, properly trained ironbills make excellent guards.
