Each creature attempting to control the stampede must attempt a `DC 30 Reflex check` save or be caught up in the stampede, taking 2d12+15 bludgeoning damage; a creature who succeeded at a skill check to disable the hazard this round has a +1 circumstance bonus to the Reflex save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature takes no damage.\n\n**Success** The creature takes half damage.\n\n**Failure** The creature takes full damage.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and cannot attempt to disable the hazard next round, as they must spend it extricating themselves from the stampede."
