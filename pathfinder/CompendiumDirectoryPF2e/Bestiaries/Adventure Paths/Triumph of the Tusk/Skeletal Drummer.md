  - name: "March to War"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (auditory,emotion,mental,occult) The skeletal drummer plays a regular beat that compels others to march. Each creature in a 30-foot emanation must attempt a `DC 19 Will check` save. Undead are immune. The effect lasts until the end of the skeletal drummer's next turn, but the skeletal drummer can Sustain the effect on all affected creatures that remain within the emanation.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected and is temporarily immune for 1 hour.\n\n**Success** The creature can't use actions with the move trait except to march, which uses the Stride action to move up to half the creature's Speed. If the creature has other Speeds, it can also march using those modes of travel.\n\n**Failure** As success, and the creature must spend at least 1 action each turn marching."

Variant fiddling bones

To some, music is more than a hobby-it's an obsession. Every musician who lived and died for their craft runs the risk of returning as a fiddling bones, as do musicians who died before completing their magnum opus or receiving the accolades they believe they deserved. Driven to prove themselves even in undeath, fiddling bones often challenge famous performers to music duels.
