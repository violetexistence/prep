    desc: "`pf2:r`  Bugark can use Reactive Strike when a creature within his reach uses a concentrate action, in addition to its normal trigger. He can disrupt triggering concentrate actions, and it disrupts actions on any hit, not just a critical hit.\n* * *\n\n**Trigger** A creature within the monster's reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The monster attempts a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, the monster disrupts that action. This Strike doesn't count toward the monster's multiple attack penalty, and its multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike."
