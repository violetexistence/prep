Despite the name given by orcs of the Dirt Sea, the trighoul is not a ghoul at all, but a mutagenic abomination. Its three tentacles bristle with hundreds of neural spines that let it "glide" across the sands at high speed and manipulate the nervous system of a corpse through the spinal column. Trighouls were originally created over a thousand years ago by fleshwarpers aligned with the Whispering Tyrant, giving them to raiders as weapons. While the use of trighouls is now regarded with shame and disgust, some still take advantage of the creatures to lure enemies to their deaths using the corpses of their slain comrades.

## Puppetmaster Serum

Orc alchemists familiar with fleshwarping techniques have synthesized an elixir called puppetmaster extract. The elixir transforms the drinker's limb into a tentacle that can temporarily animate the dead. One must take great care when crafting the serum, as incorrectly mixed batches have been known to dissolve organs from within, cause permanent paralysis, and grow tentacles in unwanted places.
