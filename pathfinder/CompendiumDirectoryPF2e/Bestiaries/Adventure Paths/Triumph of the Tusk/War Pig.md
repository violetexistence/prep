If the war pig Wallows in an area with ample mud, water, loose soil, or similar material, the war pig instead gains 2d8 temporary Hit Points, for 1 minute and reduces the flat check DC to recover from persistent damage by 1."

While not native to Belkzen, these swine instead descended from livestock raided and re-homed millennia ago during orc raids. Generations of selective breeding favored larger animals suited to Belkzen's harsh environment and fearsome predators, resulting in the modern war pig. During the flood season, these pigs gorge and grow fat, gradually consuming their reserves to become leaner and meaner during the rest of the year.

Arguably domesticated, war pigs rarely remain in captivity for more than a few generations. Most orcs loathe the notion of their swine becoming too tame, instead releasing part of their herd every year to grow fierce before recapturing them seasons later. The downside is that these feral swine associate humanoids with food. Rogue war pigs sometimes form roving gangs that uproot fields, run amok, and even knock over trade caravans to eat rations (and the occasional merchant).

The "war" in war pigs comes from their use as mounts. With the right motivation, a war pig is a porcine juggernaut able to carry a fully armored orc into combat. Without discipline, care, and treats, that same pig can become 600 pounds of willful chaos that's as likely to trample foes as it is to flee combat, find a mud puddle, and crush its rider after flopping down to vigorously wallow.
