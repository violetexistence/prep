War aurochs are especially large versions aurochs bred to pull war machines as their primary duty. Particularly aggressive calves are selected for additional training to fight in battle as support for warriors.

Belkzen's megafauna husbandry is a source of orc pride, with many species bred for everyday life. In battle, they provide an edge against foes.

## War Barding

A war aurochs is often fitted with pieces of armor to make its attacks deadlier, such as spiked ornaments on their horns or sharp-toed hoof shoes. The symbol of a hold is painted directly onto the beast's hide and left there even if another hold captures it, where it's often treated as a prisoner of war.
