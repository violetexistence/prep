    desc: "`pf2:r`  **Trigger** A creature within the monster's reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The monster attempts a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, the monster disrupts that action. This Strike doesn't count toward the monster's multiple attack penalty, and its multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike."

  - name: "[[Creature Family Ability Glossary/(Graveknight) Rejuvenation|Rejuvenation]]"
    desc: " (divine) When a graveknight is destroyed, its armor rebuilds its body over the course of 1d10 days-or more quickly if the armor is worn by a living host. If the body is destroyed before then, the process restarts.\n\nA graveknight can only be permanently destroyed by obliterating its armor (such as with [[Spells/Disintegrate|Disintegrate]]), transporting it to the Forge of Creation, or throwing it into the heart of a volcano."

    desc: "  A creature with void healing draws health from void energy rather than vitality energy. It is damaged by vitality damage and is not healed by vitality healing effects. It does not take void damage, and it is healed by void effects that heal undead."

  - name: "Pike Master"
    desc: "`pf2:3`  Pokmit's longspear reach increases by 5 feet until the start of his next turn, and he makes a single longspear Strike against any number of creatures. These attacks count toward Pokmit's multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after all the attacks."

  - name: "Pokmit's Discernment"
    desc: "  **Frequency** once per round\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Pokmit sizes up the defenses of a creature within 30 feet; he must know the creature is near, but need not be able to see it. Until the start of Pokmit's next turn, Pokmit's attacks against the target ignore any flat check required due to the target being [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] or [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]]."

  - name: "Ruinous Weapons"
