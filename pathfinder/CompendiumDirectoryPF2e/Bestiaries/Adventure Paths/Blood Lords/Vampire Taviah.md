  - name: "[[Creature Family Ability Glossary/(Vampire, Vetalarana, Basic) Mental Rebirth|Mental Rebirth]]"
    desc: " (curse,incapacitation,mental,occult) Unlike most other undead, a vetalarana isn't destroyed when they reach 0 HP. Instead, their body is destroyed, crumbling to ash, and their mind is immediately transferred into a creature they rendered comatose through Drain Thoughts. This creature must be within 1 mile; if no such creature is in range, the vetalarana is destroyed. The creature becomes controlled by the vetalarana and loses the stupefied and [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]] conditions. If the creature controlled by a vetalarana in this way is killed, the vetalarana's mind transfers to another creature within 1 mile who they rendered comatose through Drain Thoughts.\n\nTaviah has no comatose creatures to transfer her consciousness to.\n\nAfter 1d6 days of being controlled, the controlled creature dies, and its body transforms into that of the vetalarana who rendered it comatose."

  - name: "[[Creature Family Ability Glossary/(Vampire, Vetalarana, Basic) Vetalarana Vulnerabilities|Vetalarana Vulnerabilities]]"
    desc: "  All vetalaranas possess the following weaknesses.\n\n*   **Barred Senses** A vetalarana can't see or sense through force effects or cold iron, and their mind can't penetrate force effects or cold iron. Such barriers can prevent the transference of a vetalarana's mind through Mental Rebirth.\n*   **Revulsion** A vetalarana delights in consuming memories and secrets, and is disgusted by those who share such sensitive tidbits openly. A vetalarana can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of a creature loudly voicing their intimate personal secrets or most cherished memories aloud. Speaking such information aloud with conviction is a single action that has the auditory, concentrate, and linguistic traits, and protects the creature until the start of its next turn. A vetalarana that involuntarily comes within 10 feet of a creature sharing such information gains the [[Conditions/Fleeing|Fleeing]] condition until they're 10 feet or farther from the creature. After 1 round of being exposed to the secrets of a creature, a vetalarana can attempt a `DC 25 Will check` save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, they overcome their revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success).\n*   **Vulnerable to Brain Destruction** A vetalarana whose brain has been destroyed, or is reduced to 0 HP while unable to take mental actions, can't use Mental Rebirth."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Void Healing|Void Healing]]"
    desc: "  A creature with void healing draws health from void energy rather than vitality energy. It is damaged by vitality damage and is not healed by vitality healing effects. It does not take void damage, and it is healed by void effects that heal undead."

  - name: "Bonds of Iron"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (attack,occult) **Frequency** once per day\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Taviah can cause a cage built of cold-iron fingernails to spring from nothingness around a target at a range of up to 30 feet, attempting an Athletics check to [[Actions/grapple|grapple]] against the target's Fortitude DC. If the target has a weakness to cold iron, Taviah gains a +2 circumstance bonus to this check. Unlike a normal Grapple, Taviah doesn't need to be within reach and can move as she pleases, and a successful attempt lasts until the creature [[Actions/escape dc=29|escape dc=29]]{Escapes} (DC 29), causing the cage to crumble into rust. Any creature can attempt to destroy the cage by attacking it; it has an AC of 19, Hardness 10, and 40 Hit Points."

  - name: "[[Creature Family Ability Glossary/(Vampire, Vetalarana, Basic) Drain Thoughts|Drain Thoughts]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (mental,occult) **Requirements** A [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]], [[Conditions/Paralyzed|Paralyzed]], [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]], [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]], or willing creature is within Taviah's reach\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Taviah seizes a creature and consumes its memories. This requires an `Athletics check` check against the victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The victim is [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] ([[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] if Taviah's Athletics check is a critical success), and Taviah regains 18 healing Hit Points, gaining any excess as temporary Hit Points. Draining Thoughts from a creature that is already stupefied doesn't restore any HP to Taviah but increases the victim's stupefied value by 1. Additionally, Taviah views one of the victim's memories, and can choose to alter, enhance, or erase the memory she views as a 4th-rank [[Spells/Rewrite Memory|Rewrite Memory]] spell. A victim's stupefied condition value decreases by 1 every week.\n\nA victim that becomes [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 5]] in this way is rendered comatose until Taviah is destroyed, becoming permanently unconscious. While unconscious, its stupefied condition doesn't decrease."

  - name: "[[Creature Family Ability Glossary/(Vampire, Vetalarana, Manipulator) Paralyzing Claws|Paralyzing Claws]]"
    desc: " (incapacitation,occult) Any living creature hit by Taviah's claw Strike must succeed at a `DC 29 Fortitude check` save or become [[Conditions/Paralyzed|Paralyzed]]. The target can attempt a new save at the end of each of its turns to end the effect, and the DC cumulatively decreases by 1 on each such save."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Rend|Rend (Claw)]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  A Rend entry lists a Strike the monster has.\n\n**Requirements** The monster hit the same enemy with two consecutive Strikes of the listed type in the same round.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The monster automatically deals that Strike's damage again to the enemy."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Grab|Grab]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** The monster's last action was a successful Strike that lists Grab in its damage entry, or the monster has a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]\n* * *\n\n**Effect** If used after a Strike, the monster attempts to [[Actions/grapple|grapple]] the creature using the body part it attacked with. This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."
