Spellcasters who harness the power of the Dimension of Dreams may use it to fuel vicious servitors known as terrorguards-hulking terrors adorned with frames made of an Abysium alloy. Terrorguards come in many forms; creators often design the constructs' frames to mimic grotesque aberrations by mixing-and-matching parts.
