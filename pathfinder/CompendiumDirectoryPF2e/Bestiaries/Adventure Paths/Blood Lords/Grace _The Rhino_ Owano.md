While raging, she gains weakness to unholy 10, gains a +10-foot status bonus to her Speed, and takes a -1 penalty to AC. She can't use actions with the concentrate trait unless they also have the rage trait. This Celestial Rage lasts for 1 minute, until there are no enemies Grace can perceive, or until she falls [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]], whichever comes first. When the Celestial Rage ends, Grace can't use Celestial Rage again for 1 minute.\n\n[[Feat_Feature Effects/Effect_ Rage|Effect: Celestial Rage]]"

If that Strike also reduces the creature to 0 Hit Points, she can continue making melee Strikes until she makes a Strike that doesn't reduce a creature to 0 Hit Points, or until there are no creatures adjacent to the most recent creature she attacked while cleaving, whichever comes first."
