Terra-cotta warriors guard the tombs of ancient rulers, where they stand vigil, animating only when intruders break in to pilfer riches or defile the tomb itself. Each warrior is meticulously crafted from clay and given unique features.

A single terra-cotta warrior stands 6 feet tall and weighs 600 pounds.
