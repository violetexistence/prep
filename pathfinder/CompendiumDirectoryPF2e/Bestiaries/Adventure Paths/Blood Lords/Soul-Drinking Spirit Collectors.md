    desc: "(4 actions) This trap loses 1 action each turn for each disabled spirit collector. Each spirit collector uses 1 action to drain the souls of all creatures within 30 feet, dealing 4d10+20 force damage (`DC 46 Fortitude check`). On a failed save, a creature becomes [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]] and [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] or increases their drained and stupefied conditions by 1 (by 2 on a critical failure)."
