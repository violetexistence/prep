He commands the enemy to kneel in obedience. If they refuse, they must pay the price in pain and anguish. The triggering creature must choose one of the following options: the enemy kneels, dropping [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] as a free action, or the enemy refuses and takes 5d6 mental damage. In addition, Seldeg's Strikes against the triggering creature deal an additional 3 damage until the end of his next turn. Seldeg chooses whether the additional damage is spirit or void each time he uses this reaction."
