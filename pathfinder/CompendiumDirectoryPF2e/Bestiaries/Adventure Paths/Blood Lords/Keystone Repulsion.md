    desc: "(4 actions) The trap loses 1 action each turn for each removed or isolated keystone. Each keystone spends 1 action to release a wave of force, dealing 4d10+22 force damage in a 15-foot cone (`DC 42 Reflex check`) and pushing each creature back 5 feet. On a failed save, the distance a creature is pushed increases to 10 feet."
