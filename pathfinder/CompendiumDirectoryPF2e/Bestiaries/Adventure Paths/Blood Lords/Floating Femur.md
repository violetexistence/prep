    desc: "  A floating femur freezes up if [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]]. For 1 minute after the femur becomes grabbed or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]] by a creature, the femur can't act, and the creature holding it can use it as a _+1 club_ with the fatal d10 trait. After that time, the floating femur can act and is generally quite aggressive toward whomever used it as a weapon."
