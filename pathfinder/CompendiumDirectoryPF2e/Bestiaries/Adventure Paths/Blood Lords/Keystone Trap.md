    desc: "A 5-foot-square metal vault covered with knobs lies concealed within a stone block. A lever on the stone block slides the vault into view. When the vault is exposed-whether it's slid out or whether the stone is smashed open-the trap activates."

  - name: "Electrify"
    desc: "action The metal vault crackles with electricity. In air, this would damage only creatures touching it; in water, the trap deals 2d8 electricity damage to all creatures in a 10-foot emanation (`DC 25 Fortitude check`)."

  - name: "Spin"
    desc: "action The vault spins quickly for 1 round. While it Spins, checks to disable the trap have a -2 circumstance penalty, and it Launches Darts at all creatures within 30 feet of it, rather than in a line."
