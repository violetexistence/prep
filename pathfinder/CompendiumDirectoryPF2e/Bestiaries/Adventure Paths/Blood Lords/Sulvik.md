    desc: "  Each of Sulvik's heads rolls its own initiative and has its own turn. Neither head can [[Actions/Delay|Delay]]. At the start of a head's turn, that head gets 2 actions and 1 reaction. Each brain controls its own tongue and one of Sulvik's arms, but both can move the legs. Any ability that would sever Sulvik's head (such as the _[[Equipment/Vorpal|Vorpal]]_ weapon property) doesn't cause him to die if he has his other head, but does cause him to lose the turns, actions, and reactions of the severed head. Mental effects that target a single creature affect only one of Sulvik's heads."

If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, the monster disrupts that action.

  - name: "Paralysis"
    desc: " (incapacitation,occult) A living creature hit by Sulvik's tongue Strike must succeed at a `DC 28 Fortitude check` save or become [[Conditions/Paralyzed|Paralyzed]]. The creature can attempt a new save at the end of each of its turns, and the DC cumulatively decreases by 1 on each attempt."

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."
