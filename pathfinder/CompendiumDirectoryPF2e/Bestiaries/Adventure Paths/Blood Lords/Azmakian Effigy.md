Xar-Azmak, the demonic Lord of Rust, was destroyed long ago by Dispater. Some weapons of his infernal legions remain and among the most infamous are Azmakian effigies: fearsome infernal constructs shaped in his image.

Although made of iron, an Azmakian effigy's exterior is thick with rust that flakes off as the construct moves and fights. Effigies charge into battle on massive hooves, impaling enemies on long, curving horns. The effigy's most well-known attack-and the ability that makes even the bravest warrior tremble-is their terrible rusting breath, which can reduce even legendary magical weapons to useless scrap. Wise adventurers attempt to fight an effigy at a distance, but these constructs are surprisingly swift and able to outrun many foes.

The secret to creating Azmakian effigies is thought to be lost, but infernal libraries might still contain the necessary rituals and list of ingredients. Xar-Azmak once commanded ranks of effigies that numbered in the thousands, but most of those who survived his destruction were trapped in Hell, where they were pursued by Dispater's forces and eventually destroyed. Those few who offered their services to Xar-Azmak's devoted worshippers on Golarion survived this purge. With the death of Xar-Azmak, much of the lore to repair the effigies was lost. When one of these constructs is found, they're often suffering some form of long-term damage.
