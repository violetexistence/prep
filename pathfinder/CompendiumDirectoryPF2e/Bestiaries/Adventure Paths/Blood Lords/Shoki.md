  - name: "Soul Lock"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (divine,incapacitation) **Requirements** The shoki doesn't have a soul locked within their staff\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The shoki attempts to capture the soul of a creature on the brink of death: either an undead creature, a creature with the dying condition, or a creature who died within the last minute. The target must attempt a `DC 32 Will check` save with the following results.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected and becomes temporarily immune to Soul Lock.\n\n**Success** The shoki's staff tugs at the creature's soul but doesn't trap it. If the creature is living, it becomes [[Conditions/Doomed|Doomed 1]] (or increases its doomed condition by 1). If the creature is a corporeal undead, it becomes [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 2]]. If the creature is an incorporeal undead, it becomes [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 2]]. The creature then becomes temporarily immune to Soul Lock for 24 hours.\n\n**Failure** The shoki captures the creature's soul in its staff. If the creature is living, it dies. If the creature is a corporeal undead, its body becomes an inanimate corpse. While the soul is locked in the staff, the target can't be returned to life or undeath, or rejuvenate through any means, save for powerful magic, such as miracle or wish. If the shoki's staff is destroyed or the shoki wills it, the soul is released. A shoki's staff can only hold one soul at a time."
