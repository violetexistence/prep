The straugh releases a disgusting cloud of gas and decaying detritus in a 15-foot cone; any creature within the area must attempt a `DC 28 Fortitude check` save. On a failure, the creature is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]]. On a critical failure, the creature also takes a -5 foot status penalty to its Speeds for 1 round. Any creature that succeeds at the save is temporarily immune to Fetid Screech for 24 hours.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Fetid Screech (Critical Failure)|Effect: Fetid Screech (Critical Failure)]]"

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead spend an action to use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

When skirmishes break out between tunneling ghouls and creatures that dwell beneath the surface of Golarion, there's a chance that ghoul fever could infect such animals, producing strange new variants of ghoul beasts. However, letting the natural corruption run its course sometimes results in unsatisfying monsters, so some necromancers speed the process. This is the situation that led to the creation of the first straugh. A priest of Kabriri made the monstrosity to defend a claimed cemetery from another sect of ghouls who were preying upon the interred bodies. In some places, ghouls use straughs to tunnel into rival warrens or highly fortified mausoleums.
