    desc: "(1 action) A wave of force flows down the hall from north to south, dealing 3d10+20 force damage to each creature in the corridor. Each creature must attempt a `DC 40 Reflex check`. On a failure, a creature is pushed back 5 feet (10 feet on a critical failure). If this movement would cause a creature to hit another creature, both creatures take 1d6 bludgeoning damage. If this movement would cause a creature to hit a force barrier, the creature takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage. Animals, plants, and worshippers of Pharasma are immune to this force damage."
