Designed to serve as devastatingly powerful foot soldiers against enemies with plentiful magic, facetbound nullifiers shear through magical effects as easily as they slice through flesh and bone. The _pale lavender ellipsoid aeon stones_ they bear are sunk deep into their heads and surrounded by an ugly bruise.

* * *

Inspired by the work of the Azlanti and their obsessions with aeon stones, certain necromancers strive to tap into those curious magical items to create undead with powerful abilities. A facetbound is created from a living being with an _aeon stone_ surgically attached to their skull who is killed in a specific, secret ritual. Each facetbound must bear a single _aeon stone_, and this stone determines the powers the facetbound wields (in place of the normal powers of the implanted stone)
