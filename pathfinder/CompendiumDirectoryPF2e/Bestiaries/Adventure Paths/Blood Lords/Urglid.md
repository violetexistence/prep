    desc: "  Tremorsense allows a monster to feel the vibrations through a solid surface caused by movement. It is an imprecise sense with a limited range (listed in the ability). Tremorsense functions only if the monster is on the same surface as the subject, and only if the subject is moving along (or burrowing through) the surface."

  - name: "Gravechoke"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (concentrate,divine,earth,olfactory) The urglid emits a putrid pulse that targets all living creatures within a 30-foot emanation. Creatures in this area that fail a `DC 30 Fortitude check` save become [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] ([[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]] on a critical failure)."

  - name: "Ravenous Earth"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,earth) With a single, devious thought, the urglid causes a mound of grave soil to well up at a creature's feet. A creature failing a `DC 30 Reflex check` save is [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]. The restrained creature then begins sinking below the ground into a spontaneously formed grave. A creature restrained by this ability for three rounds is buried 6 feet deep in the ground and begins suffocating within 1 minute. A buried creature must be dug up to be freed. A creature who is slain by Ravenous Earth rises as a ghoul the next midnight."

The hulking monstrosities known as urglids form from the souls of murderous undertakers, sadists who buried their victims alive, and intentionally neglectful grave keepers who gave up their watch over the dead. Standing over 30 feet tall and weighing over 3,000 pounds, the demon's head seems sunken into its torso, and a gaping, toothy mouth opens at the top of its chest.
