Shabtis raised among the secret Pharasmin sect of the Carters Consortium are trained to destroy undead and the necromancers who create them.

* * *

Shabtis are facsimiles of the rich and powerful, patched together from shards of other souls and offered as a sacrifice to the Boneyard to suffer for the sins of their creator. Shabtis are unaware they aren't the person they emulate, and most spend an eternity enduring the punishments owed to another while the soul they emulate escapes judgement. Some shabtis discover their nature and often become adrift, drowning in the feelings and memories of their foul creator, with no true purpose and identities of their own.
