    desc: "The unfinished portalrender continues to flood area **B4** with agony, and everyone in the room must attempt a `DC 33 Will check` save against its Agonizing Pulse. At the end of its turn, the unfinished portalrender attempts a `DC 6 Flat check`. On a failure, its stores of agony deplete and it deactivates, causing the central orb of agony to fade away permanently."
