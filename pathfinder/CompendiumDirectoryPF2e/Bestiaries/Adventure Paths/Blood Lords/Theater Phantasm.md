    desc: "  Tremorsense allows a monster to feel the vibrations through a solid surface caused by movement. It is an imprecise sense with a limited range (listed in the ability).

If it uses this ability again on a new target, the former creature loses its spotlight.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Spotlight|Effect: Spotlight]]"
