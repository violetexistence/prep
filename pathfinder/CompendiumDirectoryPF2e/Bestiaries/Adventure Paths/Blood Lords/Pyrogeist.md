Born from the deaths of arsonists who died in the fires they started, pyrogeists are roiling infernos whose spectral fire emits no actual heat and harms only living creatures. Obsessed with sharing their torment with the living, pyrogeists haunt the area of their demise until whatever wrong they refuse to forgive has been righted, and they are finally put to rest. While pyrogeists can't set their own fires, they often use their terrifying illusory capabilities and telekinetic powers to lure their victims into setting themselves ablaze.
