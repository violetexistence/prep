    desc: "`pf2:r` (emotion, fear, mental) **Trigger** A creature other than Kepgeda is within 15 feet of the cauldron for at least 1 round\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The screams increase in intensity, and a torrent of phantasmal, three-fingered hands with iron claws spews from the cauldron to assail creatures in area **E13**. Each creature in the room must attempt a `DC 23 Will check` save, with the following results. Kepgeda is immune to the haunt's effects, as she loves the cauldron's screams. The haunt then rolls initiative.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]].\n\n**Failure** The creature becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] and becomes [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] as long as they remain frightened.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 3]] and is [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] as long as they remain frightened."

    desc: "(1 action) The spectral hands scurry about, grabbing at all of Kepgeda's foes in area **E13**. Each such creature takes 3d6 mental damage (`DC 20 Will check`) as the spectral claws assail them. A creature that takes mental damage from this effect doesn't reduce their frightened value at the end of their next turn."
  - name: "Reset"
    desc: "The haunt becomes inert (resuming its usual screaming) at the end of any round in which no creatures other than Kepgeda remain in her kitchen."
