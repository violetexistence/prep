    desc: "`pf2:r` (illusion, mental, occult) **Trigger** At the start of a round after a creature who can dream and isn't immune to sleep effects enters the room, the portal starts to glow with purple mist. At this point, the portal triggers as soon as such a creature looks into it. A character who just passes by and doesn't specifically avert their gaze must attempt a `DC 11 Flat check` to not accidently glance into the portal, while a character who Searches this room automatically looks into it unless they specify otherwise.\n\n**Effect** The nightmare portal casts [[Spells/Phantasmal Calamity|Phantasmal Calamity]] (heightened to 8th level, `DC 37 Will check`), making reality appear to crumble away to reveal a vast cavern filled with bones through which immense wormlike creatures burrow as they endlessly eat away at the world. The trap then rolls initiative."

    desc: "(2 actions) A vision of an immense lumbering figure with nothing but a circular mouth for a face lurches out of the portal. For each action, the nightmare portal casts [[Spells/Phantasmal Killer|Phantasmal Killer]] (heightened to 8th level, `DC 38 Will check`), targeting a different creature both times. It can select targets in area **E11**, the secret alcove to the northeast, or up to 10 feet east from the door (although a closed door blocks it), choosing the closest two targets each round. The nightmare portal loses 1 action if it's broken and can thus only cast _phantasmal killer_ once per round."
