    desc: "`pf2:2`  **Frequency** until recharged\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The bloodshroud channels a spell that takes 1 or 2 actions to cast and requires a spell attack roll into a claw or greatsword Strike. The effects of the spell don't occur immediately but are imbued into the bloodshroud's attack instead. The bloodshroud makes a melee Strike with a weapon or claw. The spell is coupled with the bloodshroud's attack, using the attack roll result to determine the effects of both the Strike and the spell. This counts as two attacks for the purposes of determining the bloodshroud's multiple attack penalty, but the penalty is not applied until after the Spellstrike. Using Bloodshift automatically recharges the bloodshroud's Spellstrike."

During the war between Geb and Nex, necromancers conducted dangerous magical experiments to gain every possible advantage over their enemies. One such endeavor attempted to distill the essence of vampiric mists to create a protective shroud for an army of undead maguses.
