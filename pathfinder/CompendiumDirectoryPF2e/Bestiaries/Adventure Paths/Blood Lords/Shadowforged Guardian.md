Shadowforged guardians are created through the intricate and dangerous process of siphoning penumbral energies and matter from the Shadow Plane and then binding them to a physical skeleton of wood and metal.

The first shadowforged guardians were created thousands of years ago in Nidal and were usually crafted in the likeness of that nation's patron deity, Zon-Kuthon. Shadowforged guardians are understandably in high demand; unfortunately, only the person who speaks a special word or phrase at the moment of the construct's creation can command it. Those who know the hidden formula to craft these constructs guard the secret well and only a few shadowcasters deign to create these guardians on another person's behalf-for a hefty price.
