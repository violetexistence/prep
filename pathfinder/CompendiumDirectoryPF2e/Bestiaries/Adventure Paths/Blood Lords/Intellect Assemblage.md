Intellect assemblages are artificial constructs created from the memories of others. These memories are solidified into jagged shards similar in appearance to shattered glass and fused together in vaguely humanoid-shaped clusters to create the assemblage's body. The resulting construct is incredibly intelligent but completely devoid of emotion, possessing the thoughts and memories of a multitude but no personal connection to any of them. Analytical and meticulous, intellect assemblages view the world and everything in it as parts of a complex equation or system. They place no value on life or morality and consider emotions an illogical weakness.
