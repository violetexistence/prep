Tomb giant defender

Masters of mausoleums and keepers of crypts, the dread creatures called tomb giants are anathema to all living beings, but especially so to other types of giants. Long ago, so the legends say, tomb giants sold their souls in exchange for unfathomable necromantic powers. With whom they made this foul bargain remains a mystery-if the rumors hold any truth at all. Still, tomb giants' power over undeath remains undeniable, and nearly all of them embrace a fervent passion for necromancy.

Tomb giants construct massive gothic settlements in haunted valleys and on forsaken hillsides, far enough away from the societies of smaller people that they remain relatively undisturbed, but close enough that they can raid the graveyards of nearby villages with impunity.

Elder tomb giants-those who have animated countless hordes of humanoid zombies and skeletons and yearn for even greater challenges-enjoy the thrill of subduing, slaying, and reanimating their fellow giants. Taiga giants in particular are choice prey to an experienced tomb giant, as their larger cousins make formidable undead guardians and warriors.

A tomb giant views its mortal life as only one part of its existence. After death, most tomb giants are themselves reanimated as undead, who then continue to practice their necromantic arts.

* * *

Many kinds of giants lurk in the inhospitable corners of the world, making their homes in unlikely locales ranging from fetid sinkholes and ruined battlefields to mass graveyards and barren badlands.
