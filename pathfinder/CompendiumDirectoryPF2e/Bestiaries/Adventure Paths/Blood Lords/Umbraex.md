    desc: "  This monster regains the listed number of Hit Points each round at the beginning of its turn. Its [[Conditions/Dying|Dying]] condition never increases beyond Dying 3 as long as its regeneration is active. However, if it takes damage of a type listed in the regeneration entry, its regeneration deactivates until the end of its next turn. Deactivate the regeneration before applying any damage of a listed type, since that damage might kill the monster by bringing it to Dying 4."

An umbraex appears at first glance to be a massive, majestic bird, much like a phoenix. Instead of compassion and warmth, however, it seethes with cold and hate. The umbraex is among the largest of the nihilistic undead called darvakkas.
