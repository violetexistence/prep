Variant elite giant animated statue

As with any humanoid animated statues of Medium size, giant animated statues are used to guard locations of importance, but their increased size and power make them most useful in large vaults, spacious chambers, or outdoor locations. Animated objects of this strength and size are ideal for tasks and responsibilities usually performed by golems, and more powerful animated objects are thus all but unheard of.

* * *

Granted a semblance of life through the use of rituals or other strange magic, animated objects take many forms and serve a variety of uses. A few examples of typical animated objects are listed below. Many of these creatures serve as guardians, surprising unsuspecting adventurers when they suddenly attack. Others serve as idle distractions for the exceptionally rich, simple servants created to handle odd jobs, and the like.
