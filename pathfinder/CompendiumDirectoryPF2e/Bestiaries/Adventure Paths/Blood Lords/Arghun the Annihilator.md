    desc: "  Tremorsense allows a monster to feel the vibrations through a solid surface caused by movement. It is an imprecise sense with a limited range (listed in the ability). Tremorsense functions only if the monster is on the same surface as the subject, and only if the subject is moving along (or burrowing through) the surface."

    desc: "  A crawling hand can be assigned a quarry by anointing the hand with a drop of the intended quarry's blood. If the hand ever has no quarry, it automatically gains the next creature it damages as its quarry. The hand gains a +1 circumstance bonus to Perception checks when it [[Actions/Seek|Seek]] its quarry, to Survival checks when it [[Actions/Track|Tracks]] its quarry, and damage rolls when it Strikes its quarry."

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

Variant elite crawling hand

Typically, crawling hands are formed when severed appendages are endowed with a crude sentience by evil necromantic energies that turn them into tireless killers. Yet crawling hands can also arise spontaneously, usually when a creature loses an appendage in a place rife with necromantic energy or with a connection to the Void.

* * *

A crawling hand formed from the appendage of a Medium creature is quick and agile, skittering in the shadows until it can strike its prey.
