    desc: "`pf2:2` (primal,water) **Requirements** The drowned mummy is underwater\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The drowned mummy commands the water to churn, creating a powerful whirlpool centered on itself. Each creature within a 30-foot emanation centered on the drowned mummy takes 14d8 bludgeoning damage (`DC 38 Reflex check`) as the powerful current batters them around. A creature that fails this save is pushed 20 feet away from the mummy and also falls [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] on a critical failure. The drowned mummy can't use Whirlpool again for 1d4 rounds."

Rarely artificially created, drowned mummies are miserable, dripping undead that have adapted to exist in an aquatic environment, usually over centuries, after their tomb or lair becomes flooded.
