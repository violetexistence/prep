  - name: "[[Creature Family Ability Glossary/(Vampire, Vetalarana, Basic) Mental Rebirth|Mental Rebirth]]"
    desc: " (curse,incapacitation,mental,occult) Unlike most other undead, a vetalarana isn't destroyed when they reach 0 HP. Instead, their body is destroyed, crumbling to ash, and their mind is immediately transferred into a creature they rendered comatose through Drain Thoughts. This creature must be within 1 mile; if no such creature is in range, the vetalarana is destroyed. The creature becomes controlled by the vetalarana and loses the stupefied and [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]] conditions. If the creature controlled by a vetalarana in this way is killed, the vetalarana's mind transfers to another creature within 1 mile who they rendered comatose through Drain Thoughts.\n\nAfter 1d6 days of being controlled, the controlled creature dies, and its body transforms into that of the vetalarana who rendered it comatose."

  - name: "[[Creature Family Ability Glossary/(Vampire, Vetalarana, Basic) Vetalarana Vulnerabilities|Vetalarana Vulnerabilities]]"
    desc: "  All vetalaranas possess the following weaknesses.\n\n*   **Barred Senses** A vetalarana can't see or sense through force effects or cold iron, and their mind can't penetrate force effects or cold iron. Such barriers can prevent the transference of a vetalarana's mind through Mental Rebirth.\n*   **Revulsion** A vetalarana delights in consuming memories and secrets, and is disgusted by those who share such sensitive tidbits openly. A vetalarana can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of a creature loudly voicing their intimate personal secrets or most cherished memories aloud. Speaking such information aloud with conviction is a single action that has the auditory, concentrate, and linguistic traits, and protects the creature until the start of its next turn. A vetalarana that involuntarily comes within 10 feet of a creature sharing such information gains the [[Conditions/Fleeing|Fleeing]] condition until they're 10 feet or farther from the creature. After 1 round of being exposed to the secrets of a creature, a vetalarana can attempt a `DC 25 Will check` save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, they overcome their revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success).\n*   **Vulnerable to Brain Destruction** A vetalarana whose brain has been destroyed, or is reduced to 0 HP while unable to take mental actions, can't use Mental Rebirth."

    desc: "  **Frequency** once per day\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The vetalarana manipulator spends 10 minutes to take psychic control of the creatures they've rendered comatose with Drain Thoughts. This has the effects of the [[Spells/Possession|Possession]] spell, but lasts for up to 6 hours, has a range of 1 mile, and the vetalarana can control a number of comatose victims at a time equal to half the vetalarana's level. A comatose victim can't resist this possession and automatically gets a critical failure on its saving throw against Control Comatose.\n\nAs long as a comatose victim is controlled by a vetalarana manipulator in this way, the victim's stupefied and [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]] conditions are temporarily suppressed."

This requires an `Athletics check` check against the victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The victim is [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] and Kemnebi regains 35 healing HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Draining Thoughts from a creature that's already stupefied doesn't restore any HP to Kemnebi but increases the victim's stupefied value by 2. Additionally, Kemnebi views one of the victim's memories and can choose to alter, enhance, or erase the memory he views as 4th- level [[Spells/Rewrite Memory|Rewrite Memory]].\n\nA victim's stupefied condition value decreases by 1 every week.\n\nA victim who becomes [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 5]] in this way is rendered comatose, becoming permanently unconscious. As long as Kemnebi lives, a comatose victim can't regain consciousness, and its stupefied condition doesn't decrease."

  - name: "Flurry of Blows"

It can attempt a new save at the end of each of its turns, and the DC cumulatively decreases by 1 on each such save."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Improved Grab|Improved Grab]]"

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead spend an action to use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."
