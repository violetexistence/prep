    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,occult,polymorph) The creeping crone can take on the appearance of any Medium humanoid woman, changing her walking stick to suit her new appearance. This doesn't change her Speed or Strikes, but it might change the damage type her Strikes deal (typically to bludgeoning).\n* * *\n\nThe monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

  - name: "Walking Stick"
    desc: "  A creeping crone can spend 1 day enchanting her walking stick with the powers of a _+2 striking greater staff of necromancy_. A crone replaces any material component of an occult spell she casts by using the walking stick as a focus component instead. The walking stick's magic functions only for the crone who created it; for anyone else, it's a mundane stick. If the crone enchants a new walking stick, the previous stick loses all its powers."

Hags are neither immortal nor unageing; if not slain by an enemy, a hag eventually succumbs to old age. A hag who dies in agony or rage can rise again as a witchfire, while those who die of old age might rise again as an undead creature known as a creeping crone. A creeping crone has lost far more than her life; they can't form or join covens, denying them one of a living hag's most distinguishing abilities. This inability, more than their rotting bodies or hunger for flesh, makes creeping crones exiled among their former kin.
