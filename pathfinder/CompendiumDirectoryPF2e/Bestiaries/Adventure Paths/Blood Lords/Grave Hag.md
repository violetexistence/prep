The curse lasts until the hag chooses to end it or is slain, rather than by returning items. Regardless of the save result, the target is then temporarily immune to the hag's grave curse for 24 hours.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** You are hounded by undead creatures of the same level as the curse. Every night, you must attempt a `DC 15 Flat check` check. On a failure, an incorporeal undead manifests to hassle and harry you throughout the night, retreating before it can take much damage and often preventing you from gaining a full night's rest. Whenever you enter a graveyard or other area where bodies are buried, you must succeed at the same flat check or a body animates as a corporeal undead (typically a skeleton or zombie) to attack you.\n\nThese undead are temporary and exist only to harry you; if you take control of the undead, move on, or otherwise avoid their attacks, incorporeal undead discorporate and corporeal undead collapse into ordinary corpses. The curse can be removed by returning the stolen items to their resting place."

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

Rot-skinned grave hags usually lair in cemeteries, mausoleums, and other burial sites; unlike most hags, they can't alter their appearance into a comely shape, so they hide from most observers. Grave hags consider such a predatory life hiding out in graveyards to be pitiful and squalid-they prefer to dwell in lands where necromancy is common and undeath isn't unusual. These grave hags become adept at necromantic magic and love posing as scholars. Schemers and plotters, they surround themselves with minions whom they send on missions to collect corpses for ghastly rituals.

Hags are surprisingly diverse, both in abilities and in their terrain.
