Variant vanth

Protecting the Boneyard are the stern and resolute guardians of the dead known as vanths, psychopomps who resemble skeletons with raven-like wings and a mask resembling a vulture's skull. Vanths carry black scythes to fight against those who would disturb the natural progression of souls, and they consider any visitor to the Boneyard a potential troublemaker. When the psychopomp armies go to war, vanths serve as front-line soldiers. They rarely speak and even more rarely show any emotion other than a grim adherence to duty.
