Graydirge's necromancer-architects used a horrifying rending process to strip the flesh and souls off most bones involved in Graydirge's construction, but modern builders lack the benefit of such gruesomely efficient magic. When haunted bones are embedded in buildings alongside mundane materials, nearby bricks and cobblestones can be infused with necromantic energy. If no one exorcises the spirits haunting the bones, they become trapped and confused, their identities and memories intermingling. After several years, they can form cobblebone swarms, malevolent haunted amalgamations of brick and bone. These vengeful creatures conjure ghostly noises to lure victims down narrow alleys or into dark stone basements, where they pummel them to death and cover their remains beneath piles of bones and brick.

Some have mistaken cobblebone swarms for cobbleswarms, but citizens of Graydirge know to look for nearby apparitions, or studded bones that move when you look away. These are sure signs of a cobblebone swarm, and an indication that one should take a different route to their destination.

Cobblebone swarms look like piles of simple bricks or cobblestones with crooked bones embedded in them, often in the shape of crude faces. As they roll along or float slowly through the air, they leave a ghostly afterimage in their wake.
