    desc: "Three `DC 35 Athletics check`, `DC 35 Crafting check`, or `DC 35 Survival check` checks to move or construct barricades strong enough to create a shelter from the flood. While this creates a safe place to stand, creatures outside of the barricaded area may still be in danger depending on the nature and the source of the flood."

    desc: "(1 action) The flood advances forward 60 feet, crashing into all creatures within its area. Each creature must attempt a `DC 30 Fortitude check` save as the floodwaters pummel them and pull them downstream. The amount and type of damage dealt are based on the nature of the flood, and certain types of floods impose additional effects. The turbulent waters mean creatures within the area of the flood must attempt a `DC 20 Athletics check` check to Swim in order to move, and those who do not succeed at a check to Swim each round may drown.\n\nThis caustic flood dissolves flesh as it moves, dealing 1d12 bludgeoning damage and 1d12+8 acid damage. Additionally, it deals 2d6 persistent acid damage to creatures who critically fail their Fortitude saves.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature takes no damage.\n\n**Success** The creature takes half damage.\n\n**Failure** The creature takes full damage and is moved 10 feet along with the water.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and is moved 20 feet along with the water."
