Common urban legends in Geb warn of the vengeful spirits of those who've been cooked alive, collectively called charghars. While many Gebbites eat people in ways that don't involve cooking, there are some undead who've grown bored after centuries of the same diet. There are also some living people in the nation who've resorted to cannibalism: either downtrodden folks who cook and eat their neighbors and kin out of necessity, or socialites who dine on such fare because it's fashionable. Regardless of the reason for cooking people, these efforts can create vengeful undead creatures who lurk wherever meals are being prepared, luring cooks into making careless or deadly mistakes.

Charghars have spectral humanoid forms, while their physical manifestations appear much as they did after they were cooked-as charred remains, gory corpses bearing disembodied butchered chunks that float nearby, or loose assemblages of boiled bones.
