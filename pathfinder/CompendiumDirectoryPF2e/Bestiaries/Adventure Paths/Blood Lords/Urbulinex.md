  - name: "[[Creature Family Ability Glossary/(Ravener) Soul Ward|Soul Ward]]"
    desc: "  An intangible field of necromantic energy protects a ravener from total destruction. A soul ward has 150 maximum Hit Points.\n\nWhenever a ravener would be reduced below 1 Hit Point, all damage in excess of what would reduce them to 1 Hit Point is instead dealt to their soul ward. If this damage reduces the soul ward to fewer than 0 Hit Points, the ravener is destroyed.\n\nA soul ward's Hit Points can be restored only via specific ravener abilities such as Consume Soul, ravenous breath, or vicious criticals. A ravener who goes more than a week without successfully using Consume Soul to feed on a dying creature starves, and their soul ward loses 1d4 Hit Points each day until they feed. If the ravener's soul ward loses all its Hit Points while the ravener still has more than 1 HP, they become a [[Bestiary 2/Ravener Husk|Ravener Husk]]."

With either option, a creature that fails its save is also [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]] (or [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 2]] on a critical failure). If at least one creature is drained by the ravener's Ravenous Breath Weapon, the ravener's soul ward gains 5 healing HP. The ravener can't use Breath Weapon again for 1d4 rounds.\n\n*   **Void** (necromancy, primal, void) The ravener breathes a blast of darkness in a 40-foot cone that deals 17d6 void damage plus 4d6 persistent void damage (`DC 39 Reflex check` save). Undead creatures take 22d6 force damage instead of the void damage.\n*   **Shadows** (necromancy, primal, shadow) The ravener breathes a blast of shadows in a 40-foot cone. Each creature within the cone must attempt a `DC 39 Fortitude check` save.\n    \n    **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n    \n    **Success** The creature is [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 2]] for 1 round.\n    \n    **Failure** The creature is enfeebled 2 for 1 minute.\n    \n    **Critical Failure** The creature is enfeebled 2 for 1 minute and [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] for 1 round."

  - name: "[[Creature Family Ability Glossary/(Ravener) Vicious Criticals|Vicious Criticals]]"
    desc: "  The ravener treats an attack roll as a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20, as long as the attack roll was a success. Additionally, whenever the ravener makes a critical hit with one of their Strikes, the target must succeed at a `DC 37 Fortitude check` save or gain the [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]] condition. If the target already has a drained value of greater than 0, their drained value instead increases by 1, to a maximum of [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 4]]. Whenever the ravener applies drain to a creature in this way, their soul ward gains 5 Hit Points.\n* * *\n\n_Note: A DC was not provided for this ability by Paizo. The DC present here is a moderate DC for the creature level according to the Gamemastery Guide creature building Tables._"
