Facetbound cascaders must have been arcane spellcasters in life; in undeath, they draw upon the power of embedded _orange prism aeon stones_ to defend themselves from magical damage and redirect that energy toward their opponents. Despite their incredible intelligence, facetbound cascaders have few memories of their former lives and typically serve the whims of their creator.

* * *

Inspired by the work of the Azlanti and their obsessions with aeon stones, certain necromancers strive to tap into those curious magical items to create undead with powerful abilities. A facetbound is created from a living being with an _aeon stone_ surgically attached to their skull who is killed in a specific, secret ritual. Each facetbound must bear a single _aeon stone_, and this stone determines the powers the facetbound wields (in place of the normal powers of the implanted stone)
