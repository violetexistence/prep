    desc: "`DC 33 Thievery check` (master) to disrupt the trap's magical network of sensors and effectively \"blind\" it to targets to react to, `DC 38 Religion check` (master) to recognize the carvings and recall one of the mantras needed to pass safely, or [[Spells/Dispel Magic|Dispel Magic]] (7th rank; counteract DC 32) to counteract the trap."

    desc: "`pf2:r` **Trigger** The trap's sensors notice a creature on the stairs north of the entrance to area **D4**\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The myriad mouths on the walls spew out a foul-smelling acidic slurry along the entire stairwell. The stairs in areas **D3** become difficult terrain, and all creatures in area **D3** must attempt a `DC 34 Reflex check` saving throw. A creature that is [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]] by hunger takes a -2 circumstance penalty to this saving throw. The trap then rolls initiative.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature takes 4d6 acid damage and is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]].\n\n**Failure** The creature takes 8d6 acid damage, is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]], and is knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]].\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature takes 16d6 acid damage, is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 3]], is knocked prone, and then tumbles down the stairs. The fall ends once the creature reaches the next lowest landing (note that a creature falling at the lowest flight tumbles into the carrion pit at area **D2**, but can attempt to [[Actions/Grab an Edge|Grab an Edge]] as detailed in that room). A creature that falls down the steps takes an additional 4d6 bludgeoning damage (`DC 32 Reflex check`) from the tumble, regardless of the total distance traveled."
