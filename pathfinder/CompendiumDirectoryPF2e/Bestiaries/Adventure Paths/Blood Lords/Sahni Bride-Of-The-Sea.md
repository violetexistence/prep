The creature gives away a special quality-such as its courage, beauty, or voice-or sacrifices a loved one in exchange for a boon or a promise from Sahni. As long as Sahni keeps her end of the bargain, the only way to restore a lost quality is to defeat Sahni or make another bargain for its return.

If Sahni is the third hag they confront, the coven is broken and she lacks these coven spells."
