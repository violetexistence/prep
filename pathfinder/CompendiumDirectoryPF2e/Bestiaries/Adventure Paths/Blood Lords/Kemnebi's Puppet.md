    desc: " (divine) Kemnebi can manipulate one of his comatose victims as if they were a puppet, maintaining complete control over each. Kemnebi's puppets are immune to all mental effects. Kemnebi can stop controlling one of his puppets as a free action. If he does, the puppet returns to its comatose state, becoming permanently [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]]. Kemnebi can reassert control as a free action, causing the puppet to temporarily lose the unconscious condition."

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."
