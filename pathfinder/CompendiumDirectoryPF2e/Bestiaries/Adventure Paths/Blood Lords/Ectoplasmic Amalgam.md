On a failed save, a creature is additionally [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]] (or [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 2]] on a critical failure). Spew Ectoplasm functions as a force effect for the purposes of affecting incorporeal creatures. The ectoplasmic amalgam can't use Spew Ectoplasm again for 1d4 rounds."
