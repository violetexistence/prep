The phalanx of phalanges makes no actions other than moving along this path or making Countless Digits attacks against creatures in its way. If impeded on this path or if it takes damage, the phalanx of phalanges is unbound from its path and is permanently berserk, attacking nearby creatures to the best of its ability."
