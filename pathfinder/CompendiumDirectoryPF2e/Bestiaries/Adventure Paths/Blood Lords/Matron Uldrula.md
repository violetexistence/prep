    desc: "`pf2:2` (divine,incapacitation) **Requirements** Matron Uldrula doesn't have a soul locked within her staff\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Matron Uldrula attempts to capture the soul of a creature on the brink of death, either an undead creature or a creature with the dying condition. The target must attempt a `DC 46 Will check` save with the following results.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected and becomes temporarily immune to Soul Lock.\n\n**Success** Matron Uldrula's staff tugs at the creature's soul but doesn't trap it. If the creature is living, it becomes [[Conditions/Doomed|Doomed 1]] (or increases its doomed condition by 1). If the creature is a corporeal undead, it becomes [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 2]]. If the creature is an incorporeal undead, it becomes [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 2]]. The creature then becomes temporarily immune to soul lock for 24 hours.\n\n**Failure** Matron Uldrula locks the creature's soul in her staff. If the creature is living, it dies. If the creature is a corporeal undead, its body becomes an inanimate corpse. If the creature is an incorporeal undead, it becomes bodily trapped within the staff. While the soul is locked in the staff, the target can't be returned to life or undeath, or rejuvenated through any means, save powerful magic, such as miracle or wish, or through divine intervention. If Matron Uldrula's staff is destroyed or she wills it, the soul is released. Matron Uldrula's staff can only hold one soul at a time."
