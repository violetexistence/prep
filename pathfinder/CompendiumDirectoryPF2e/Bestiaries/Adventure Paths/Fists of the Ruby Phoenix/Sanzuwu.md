Those who feast on the sun are said to carry its power within them. Sanzuwus are small crows with red plumage and dark throats. According to legend, they stole their burning power from the sun and now fly across the sky as blinding streaks of fire. When they land on the earth, it ignites around them, causing unbound destruction. A handful of people worship these radiant birds and inscribe their three-legged visage on coins, items, and weapons.
