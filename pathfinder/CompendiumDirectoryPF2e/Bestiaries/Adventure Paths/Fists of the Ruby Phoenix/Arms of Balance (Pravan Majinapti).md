    desc: "`pf2:2` (cold) The monk lets loose a powerful breath of air, whose effect depends on the type of energy to which the monk is attuned. The monk can't use this ability again for 1d4 rounds.\n\nPravan blows icy winds in a 30-foot cone, dealing 10d6 cold damage. Creatures in the area must attempt a `DC 33 Reflex check` save as ice forms around them. The Speed penalty or immobilized condition caused by this ability persist until a creature either Breaks Open the ice or Escapes (DC 37 in either case), or if the creature takes at least 30 fire damage.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature takes half damage and takes a -5- foot status penalty to its Speeds.\n\n**Failure** The creature takes full damage and takes a -15-foot status penalty to its Speeds.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and is [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]]."
