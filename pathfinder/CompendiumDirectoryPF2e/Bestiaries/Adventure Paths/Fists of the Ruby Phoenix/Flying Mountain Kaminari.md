  - name: "Hurricane Bag"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (air) A kaminari's bag holds the four winds. The kaminari unleashes four 20-foot bursts within 60 feet with the effects of a 9th-rank wall of wind. In addition, a creature that enters one of the bursts takes 6d6 slashing damage (`DC 40 Reflex check` save). The bursts can't overlap. After using this activity the kaminari can't use Hurricane Bag for 1d4 rounds.\n\nIf a kaminari creates a column of lighting using Thunder Drums that intersects one of the areas of the wind, the wind explodes in a peal of thunder, dealing 6d10 sonic damage to creatures in the area of that wall of wind burst. Affected creatures must attempt a `DC 40 Fortitude check` save. The kaminari can detonate only one burst per use of Thunder Drums.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The target takes half damage. Failure The target takes full damage and is [[Conditions/Deafened|Deafened]] for 1 minute.\n\n**Critical Failure** The target takes double damage and is deafened permanently."

  - name: "Tempest Tether"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (air,electricity) **Frequency** once per day\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Electricity leaps between two kaminari. The kaminari establishes a connection with another kaminari within 150 feet, and lightning and thunder form a line between the centers of their spaces. For the next minute, a creature that begins its turn in the line or enters the line on its turn takes 4d12 electricity damage (`DC 40 Reflex check` save). A creature can take this damage only once per round, even if it moves through several tempest tethers. If the distance between the kaminari ever exceeds 150 feet, the tether breaks."

  - name: "Thunder Drums"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (electricity) The peal of a kaminari's drums bring thunder and lightning. The kaminari summons four 100-foot-tall columns of lightning to strike in 5-foot bursts within 60 feet. These columns can't overlap. Creatures in the burst take 8d12 electricity damage and must attempt a `DC 40 Reflex check` save. The kaminari can't use Thunder Drums again for 1d4 rounds.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The target takes half damage.\n\n**Failure** The target takes full damage and is [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]].\n\n**Critical Failure** The target takes double damage and is [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 2]]."
