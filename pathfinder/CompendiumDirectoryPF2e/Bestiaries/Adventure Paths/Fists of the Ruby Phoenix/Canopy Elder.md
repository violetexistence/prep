    desc: "  Tremorsense allows a monster to feel the vibrations through a solid surface caused by movement. It is an imprecise sense with a limited range (listed in the ability). Tremorsense functions only if the monster is on the same surface as the subject, and only if the subject is moving along (or burrowing through) the surface."

If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, the monster disrupts that action.

  - name: "Fungal Web"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  The canopy elder launches a rapidly growing net of fungus from the mushrooms growing on its body at a single creature within 80 feet. The target must attempt a `DC 39 Reflex check` save or become restrained by the fungal web ([[Actions/escape dc=39|escape dc=39]]). While restrained, the creature takes 4d6 poison damage at the end of each of their turns."

  - name: "Pollen Cloud"
    desc: "`pf2:2`  The canopy elder releases a dense cloud of pollen from the epiphytes living in its branches. The cloud emanates from the canopy elder in a 40-foot emanation. The cloud doesn't move with the canopy elder and remains in place for 1d6 rounds before dissipating. Creatures inside the cloud become [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]], and all creatures outside the cloud become concealed to creatures within it. Non-plant and non-fungus creatures within the cloud must attempt a `DC 38 Fortitude check` save. On a failure, the creature is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 3]], and on a critical failure the creature is also [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] for 1 minute. Regardless of the result, a creature is then temporarily immune to the sickening and blinding effects of the canopy elder's pollen for 24 hours."

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead spend an action to use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

In the densest and oldest jungles, arboreals can reach heights of 200 feet or more. Given thousands of undisturbed years, these massive creatures enter into a symbiotic relationship with a myriad of plants, fungi, and animals to achieve the esteemed status of canopy elder. They provide a safe home for the creatures they host and develop a variety of powers that help them defend their forest realms.
