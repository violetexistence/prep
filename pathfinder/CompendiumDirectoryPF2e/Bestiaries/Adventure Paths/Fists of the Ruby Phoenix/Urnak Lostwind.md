    desc: "`pf2:r`  Urnak gets 1 extra reaction each turn that he can use only to make an Attack of Opportunity.\n* * *\n\n**Trigger** A creature within the monster's reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The monster attempts a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, the monster disrupts that action. This Strike doesn't count toward the monster's multiple attack penalty, and its multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike."

  - name: "Felling Throw"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  Urnak makes a ranged Strike with his greataxe. He has a +25 attack modifier for this Strike and the thrown greataxe's range increment is 40 feet. If he damages a flying creature, it descends 120 feet, possibly falling on the ground."

  - name: "Ricochet Throw"
    desc: "  When Urnak uses Felling Throw, his greataxe bounces back to him at the end of the action and he can catch it as a free action. If he uses Felling Throw again before the end of his turn (even if it's not at the same target), the attack ignores all cover."

  - name: "Sweep Aside"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  Urnak makes a melee greataxe Strike. If he hits a creature of his size or smaller, he can move it 5 feet in any direction, or 10 feet on a critical hit."
