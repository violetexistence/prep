    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,divine,polymorph) Ji-yook transforms into her human form. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the Impersonate use of Deception. Ji-yook can remain in her human form indefinitely, and she can shift back to her true kitsune form by using this action again.\n* * *\n\nThe monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

    desc: "`pf2:1`  Ji-yook expertly aims and flings a dart to peg an opponent to a nearby wall or floor. Ji-yook makes a dart Strike. If the attack hits, it deals no damage and instead pins the target to an adjacent surface. The target is [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] and must spend an Interact action to attempt a `DC 10 Athletics check` check to pull the dart free; it can't move from its space until it succeeds. If Ji-yook's dart Strike was a critical hit, the target must succeed at two separate Athletics checks to pull the dart free. The target is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] while it remains immobilized in this way."
