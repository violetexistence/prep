    desc: "passive The Elemental Plane of Air is opposed by the Plane of Earth. Any spell or magical effect with the earth trait that targets a creature or area within 50 feet of the rift deals 10 damage to the rift per spell ranks (or per 2 levels for magic items, feats, and so forth). For example, a 3rd-rank [[Spells/Earthbind|Earthbind]] spell cast on a creature near the air rift deals 30 points of damage to the rift"

    desc: "`pf2:r` **Trigger** A creature comes within 50 feet of the rift\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The air rift creates a shroud of subjective gravity around the creature for 1 minute. The creature can use a free action, which has the concentrate trait, to choose any direction they wish for gravity to pull them. This allows a creature to Stride along any surface or Fly in a straight line by choosing a direction into midair. For unattended objects and mindless creatures, this is microgravity: they float in place unless pushed off a surface."

  - name: "Routine"
    desc: "(1 action) Winds blow through the area in a random direction, causing creatures and objects within 50 feet of the air rift to float up, down, north, south, east, or west (roll a d6 to determine which direction). Creatures and objects in the area must attempt a `DC 37 Fortitude check` save. If a creature is pushed into a solid object or another creature by this effect, both take 3d8+15 bludgeoning damage on impact.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature is pushed 10 feet, but takes only half damage from impact.\n\n**Failure** The creature is pushed 20 feet, falls prone, and takes full damage from impact.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature is pushed 40 feet, falls prone, and takes double damage from impact."
