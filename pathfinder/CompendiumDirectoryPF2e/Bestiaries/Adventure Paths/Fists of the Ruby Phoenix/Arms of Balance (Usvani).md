    desc: "`pf2:2` (acid) The monk lets loose a powerful breath of air, whose effect depends on the type of energy to which the monk is attuned. The monk can't use this ability again for 1d4 rounds.\n\nUsvani exhales a miasma of acidic fumes in a 15-foot emanation. A creature that starts its turn in the area takes 12d6 acid damage- and must attempt a `DC 33 Fortitude check` save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature takes half damage and is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]].\n\n**Failure** The creature takes full damage and is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]].\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 3]]."
