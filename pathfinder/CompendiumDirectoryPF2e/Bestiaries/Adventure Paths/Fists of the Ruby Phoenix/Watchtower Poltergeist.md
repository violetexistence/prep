Each creature within 30 feet must attempt a `DC 33 Will check` save, becoming [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] on a failure. On a critical failure, it's also [[Conditions/Fleeing|Fleeing]] for as long as it's frightened. On a success, the creature is temporarily immune for 1 minute. At the start of its next turn, the poltergeist becomes invisible again."

  - name: "Telekinetic Storm"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (concentrate,occult) The poltergeist telekinetically throws numerous small objects, such as dozens of pieces of silverware or books, either spreading them out among multiple foes or directing them at one target. When this effect is spread out among multiple foes, the poltergeist makes a telekinetic object Strike at a -2 penalty against each creature within 30 feet. These count as one attack for the poltergeist's multiple attack penalty, and the penalty doesn't increase until after all the attacks. When this effect has only one target, the poltergeist makes a telekinetic object Strike against the target, and the damage increases to 4d12+15. It deals 2d12 untyped damage on a failure, and no damage on a critical failure."

Variant poltergeist

When a creature dies, and for whatever reason its spirit is unable or unwilling to leave the site of its death, that spirit may manifest as a poltergeist: a restless invisible spirit that is still able to manipulate physical objects. Many poltergeists perished in a way that resulted from or has led to extreme emotional trauma.
