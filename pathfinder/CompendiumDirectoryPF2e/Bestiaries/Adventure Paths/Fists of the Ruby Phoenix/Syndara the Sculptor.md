  - name: "Keeper of the Lighthouse"
    desc: "  Syndara can choose whether he is affected by his worldspheres."

  - name: "Portal Redirection"
    desc: " (divine,teleportation) **Trigger** Syndara is targeted by a ranged Strike or spell attack roll\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Syndara opens a portal in front of the incoming missile, then opens another portal nearby that fires the missile at another creature within 60 feet of him. He takes no damage from the triggering attack and makes a ranged Strike with a +43 attack bonus. The Strike deals damage according to the triggering ability."

  - name: "Spatial Sense"
    desc: "  Syndara instinctively knows the position of all creatures and objects within the Glass Lighthouse as a precise sense. His senses do not extend into extraplanar spaces (such as a bag of holding), even if the entrance to these spaces is within the Lighthouse."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Constant Spells|Constant Spells]]"
    desc: "  A constant spell affects the monster without the monster needing to cast it, and its duration is unlimited. If a constant spell gets counteracted, the monster can reactivate it by spending the normal spellcasting actions the spell requires."

    desc: "  A monster with this ability regains the given number of Hit Points each round at the beginning of its turn."

    desc: "`pf2:r`  **Trigger** A creature within the monster's reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The monster attempts a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, the monster disrupts that action. This Strike doesn't count toward the monster's multiple attack penalty, and its multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike."

  - name: "Essence Reflection"
    desc: "  Syndara and his reflection are two linked existences. If one of them is affected by a harmful effect, they can shift the harmful effect to the other as a free action, even if they can't act."

  - name: "Extradimensional Immunity"
    desc: "  Syndara can foil any attempts to use planar powers against him. He is immune to all extradimensional effects, such as [[Spells/Quandary|Quandary]], but can choose to be affected by such effects normally."

  - name: "Gateway Onslaught"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (teleportation) **Requirements** Syndara is in the Glass Lighthouse\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Syndara folds the fabric of the Glass Lighthouse before opening several gateways from which dangerous elements spew forth. He teleports to his throne, regardless of distance, then makes three elemental gateway Strikes. Each Strike must target a different creature. He can't use Gateway Onslaught again for 1d4 rounds."

  - name: "Planar Restructuring"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate) **Requirements** Syndara is in the Glass Lighthouse\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Syndara exerts his will over the Glass Lighthouse to cause one of several effects. The effect is magical, but Syndara isn't using magic when he takes this action-just triggering a magical effect he already set up. The level for each of these effects is 10, and any save is DC 45. Syndara or Syndara's Reflection can't use Planar Restructuring for 1d4 rounds.\n\n- Accelerate/Decelerate Syndara affects the flow of time around a target within 60 feet, affecting them with either haste or slow.\n\n- Deny Syndara rejects the existence of a power other than his own, affecting an object with disjunction.\n\n- Rewind Syndara rewinds time to undo harm. He or his reflection are affected by the two-action version of heal or by restoration.\n\n- Rise Syndara creates a gravitational nexus of reverse gravity.\n\n- Sequester Syndara folds space to affect a creature with resilient sphere."

  - name: "Temporal Flurry"
    desc: "`pf2:2`  **Frequency** once per round\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Syndara bends time to make multiple attacks. He makes three unarmed Strikes. If multiple attacks hit the same creature, combine their damage for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses."

  - name: "Vicious Impact"
    desc: "  Syndara has had an eternity to reflect on his own weaknesses and the weakness of others. If he critically hits with a melee Strike, he can target the eyes, joints, or other weak points to add one of the following effects of his choice unless the target succeeds on a `DC 46 Fortitude check` save.\n\n- The target becomes [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] for 1 minute.\n\n- The target becomes [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]] for 1 minute.\n\n- The target takes 3d6 bleed.\n\n- The target can't Step for 1 minute."

  - name: "Walk the Spiral"
    desc: "  **Requirements** Syndara is in the Glass Lighthouse\n\n**Trigger** Syndara Strikes a creature on his own turn\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Syndara rotates the space of the Glass Lighthouse around himself to carry him to a distant location in an instant. He Strides twice. This movement doesn't trigger reactions. If his next action is to attack a different target than the triggering creature, he gains a +1 circumstance bonus to that attack; each time he Walks the Spiral in a turn, this bonus increases by 1, to a maximum of +3."
