He can still disrupt a triggering manipulate action if he critically succeeds his attempt.\n* * *\n\n**Trigger** A creature within the monster's reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The monster attempts a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, the monster disrupts that action. This Strike doesn't count toward the monster's multiple attack penalty, and its multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike."

  - name: "Major Leaping Catch"
    desc: "`pf2:2`  Ran-to leaps from the ground and attempts to grab a foe while he soars. He makes a Leap, High Jump, or Long Jump. His maximum distance is 100 feet. He must succeed at an Athletics check to perform the leap as usual, but regardless of the type of leap the DC is equal to half the number of feet he moves in the air. Ran-to can attempt an Athletics check to Grapple at any point during the jump. Immediately after the attempt, he (and the creature, if the Grapple was successful) falls to the ground. Ran-to takes no falling damage when using this ability, but the grabbed creature takes the appropriate amount of falling damage as if it had fallen the distance moved. Ran-to can spend three actions to use this ability instead of two; if he does, he can use Plummeting Fall to add 12d6 bludgeoning damage to the falling damage dealt to the grabbed creature, and the creature is knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]."

  - name: "Plummeting Fall"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (certain-kill) **Frequency** once per round\n\n**Requirements** Ran-to has a creature grabbed and the creature is airborne\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Ran-to spins and increases the force of gravity, sending him and the creature to the ground. The target takes 12d6 bludgeoning damage from the fall and is knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]; Ran-to is unharmed."

  - name: "Whirlwind Toss"
    desc: "`pf2:3`  **Frequency** once per round\n\n**Requirements** Ran-to has a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]]\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Ran-to spins the creature he's holding, smashing it against any creatures within his reach, then throws the creature aside. Ran-to attempts an `Athletics check` check against the grabbed creature's Fortitude DC. Regardless of the result, the creature is no longer grabbed after this activity.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** Ran-to tosses his foe mightily. The grabbed creature is thrown into a space within 20 feet, takes 16d6 bludgeoning damage, and falls [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]. All creatures adjacent to Ran-to take the same amount of bludgeoning damage (`DC 43 Reflex check` save).\n\n**Success** As critical success, except the grabbed creature is thrown into a space within 10 feet, and creatures take 12d6 bludgeoning damage.\n\n**Failure** Ran-to tosses his foe aside. The grabbed creature falls prone.\n\n**Critical Failure** Ran-to loses hold of his foe."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Improved Grab|Improved Grab]]"
    desc: "  **Requirements** The monster's last action was a successful Strike that lists Improved Grab in its damage entry, or the monster has a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]\n* * *\n\n**Effect** If used after a Strike, the monster attempts to [[Actions/grapple|grapple]] the creature using the body part it attacked with as a free action. This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead spend an action to use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."
