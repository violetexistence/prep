She can use her living hair to perform precise tasks such as picking up objects and performing simple Interact actions, and she can automatically Grab with her hair, as the creature ability. She can also deliver hexes through her hair. Whenever Tak-nwa successfully casts a hex focus spell that requires 2 or more actions to cast and that doesn't require a spell attack roll, if her target is within reach, as part of the spellcasting activity she can make a hair Strike against the foe before applying any effects of the hex. If this Strike misses, the hex has no effect."

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."
