    desc: "`pf2:2` (electricity) The monk lets loose a powerful breath of air, whose effect depends on the type of energy to which the monk is attuned. The monk can't use this ability again for 1d4 rounds.\n\nRanya looses four lightning bolts, electrifying creatures and magnetizing them closer to her. Four 60-foot lines of electricity stretch out from Ranya's space, one in each cardinal direction, dealing 4d12 electricity damage. Each creature in an affected area must attempt a `DC 33 Reflex check` save. If this ability causes an [[Conditions/Undetected|Undetected]] creature to glow, that creature becomes [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] instead to creatures that can see any part of its space (even if it is [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]] or Sneaks).\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature takes half damage, glows until the end of the monk's next turn, and is pulled 5 feet toward Ranya.\n\n**Failure** The creature takes full damage, glows until the end of the monk's next turn, and is pulled 15 feet toward Ranya.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage, glows for 1 minute, and is pulled 30 feet toward Ranya."
