A rai sho postulant that falls prey to a supernatural nightmare loses this ability and becomes permanently enraged, gaining a +1 status bonus to attack and damage status bonus to attack and damage rolls and a -1 status penalty to AC."

  - name: "Nine Seals Spellcasting"
    desc: "  The Rai Sho postulants have learned a technique that allows them to cast their ki spells more effectively by way of specialized hand postures. They replace the normal somatic and verbal components of their spells with nine seals components; these require that the caster have a hand free, but don't add any traits to the Cast a Spell action (preventing the Rai Sho postulants from triggering certain reactions, such as Attack of Opportunity, when they Cast a Spell)."

If both hit the same creature, combine their damage for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses. If either Strike hits and deals damage, the target must succeed at a `DC 37 Fortitude check` save or be [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]] (or [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 3]] on a critical failure); this save has the incapacitation trait."
