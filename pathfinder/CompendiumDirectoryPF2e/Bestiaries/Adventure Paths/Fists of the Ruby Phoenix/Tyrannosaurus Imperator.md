  - name: "Fling"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** A creature is Grabbed in the tyrannosaurus's jaws.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The tyrannosaurus flings the creature into the air up to 10 feet up from its mouth and 20ft away. The creature falls 25 feet (assuming the tyrannosaurus flings it as high as it can) and takes falling damage accordingly (12 bludgeoning). If the flung creature lands on another creature, the creature it lands on takes the same amount of bludgeoning damage. The creature being landed upon can attempt a `DC 29 Reflex check` save."

  - name: "Pin Prey"
    desc: "`pf2:r`  **Trigger** The tyrannosaurus critically hits a Large or smaller foe with its foot.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The creature struck by the foot is knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] and the tyrannosaurus uses its foot to hold the creature in place. As long as the tyrannosaurus doesn't move from its position, the pinned creature is [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]]. A tyrannosaurus gains a +2 circumstance bonus to attack a creature it has pinned in this manner, but it cannot use swallow whole on the target unless it uses its jaws to Grab the victim first."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Swallow Whole|Swallow Whole]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (attack) Medium, 4d6+8 bludgeoning, Rupture 34\n* * *\n\nThe monster attempts to swallow a creature of the listed size or smaller that it has grabbed or restrained in its jaws or mouth. If a swallowed creature is of the maximum size listed, the monster can't use Swallow Whole again. If the creature is smaller than the maximum, the monster can usually swallow more creatures; the GM determines the maximum. The monster attempts an `Athletics check` check opposed by the grabbed creature's Reflex DC. If it succeeds, it swallows the creature. The monster's mouth or jaws no longer grab a creature it has swallowed, so the monster is free to use them to Strike or Grab once again. The monster can't attack creatures it has swallowed.\n\nA swallowed creature is [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]], is [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]], and has to hold its breath or start suffocating. The swallowed creature takes the listed amount of damage when first swallowed and at the end of each of its turns while it's swallowed. If the victim [[Actions/Escape|Escapes]] this ability's grabbed condition, it exits through the monster's mouth. This frees any other creature grabbed in the monster's mouth or jaws. A swallowed creature can attack the monster that has swallowed it, but only with unarmed attacks or with weapons of light Bulk or less. The swallowing creature is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] against the attack. If the monster takes piercing or slashing damage equaling or exceeding the listed Rupture value from a single attack or spell, the swallowed creature cuts itself free. A creature that gets free by either Escaping or cutting itself free can immediately breathe and exits the swallowing monster's space.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Engulf and Swallow Whole|Effect: Engulf and Swallow Whole]]\n\nIf the monster dies, a swallowed creature can be freed by creatures adjacent to the corpse if they spend a combined total of 3 actions cutting the monster open with a weapon or unarmed attack that deals piercing or slashing damage."

  - name: "Tail Swipe"
    desc: "`pf2:2`  The tyrannosaurus sweeps its tail in a 15-foot cone, dealing 4d8+12 bludgeoning damage to all creatures in the cone. Creatures in the area must attempt a `DC 34 Reflex check` save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature takes half damage.\n\n**Failure** The creature takes full damage and falls [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]].\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage, is pushed back 10 feet, and falls prone."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Trample|Trample]]"
    desc: "`pf2:3`  Huge or smaller, foot, `DC 34 Reflex check`\n* * *\n\nThe monster Strides up to double its Speed and can move through the spaces of creatures of the listed size, Trampling each creature whose space it enters. The monster can attempt to Trample the same creature only once in a single use of Trample. The monster deals the damage of the listed Strike, but trampled creatures can attempt a basic Reflex save at the listed DC (no damage on a critical success, half damage on a success, double damage on a critical failure)."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Grab|Grab]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** The monster's last action was a successful Strike that lists Grab in its damage entry, or the monster has a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]\n* * *\n\n**Effect** If used after a Strike, the monster attempts to [[Actions/grapple|grapple]] the creature using the body part it attacked with. This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

Variant tyrannosaurus

Widely regarded as the king of the dinosaurs, the tyrannosaurus is a massive predator with a wide mouth filled with viciously sharp teeth. Thundering beasts of fury and hunger, tyrannosauruses are bold and fearless carnivores that eagerly bite off great hunks of large prey and swallow smaller prey-such as most humanoids-in a single gulp. Although they can subsist on carrion, tyrannosaurs prefer live prey.

Tyrannosauruses stand on two wide, powerful hind legs that allow them to run quickly, and their thick tails provide them with exceptional balance. Although a their small forelimbs are of little use other than to hold prey in place while the predators tear at their victim's flesh with their fearsome jaws, even these forelimbs bear sharp claws several inches long. As fearsome as tyrannosauruses are alone, they sometimes hunt in packs to take down massive prey. Only the most powerful creatures can successfully train tyrannosauruses, and even then, only when they can provide the ravenous beasts with a steady diet of meat.

Some tribes of giants, particularly cyclopes or more obscure denizens of primeval lands, have even trained tyrannosauruses as mounts or beasts of war. In other places, xulgaths feed these prisoners to these mighty dinosaurs as part of executions or ritual sacrifices. Some xulgath cults even revere tyrannosaurs as incarnations of their violent demonic demigods. For their part, tyrannosaurs who have grown used to having their meals provided in this manner are remarkably well-behaved toward their feeders and keepers. Tyrannosauruses are 50 feet long and weigh 7 tons or more.

Other variants of the tyrannosaurs include slightly smaller dinosaurs such as allosaurus, or even larger like ravenous giganotosaurus. Even the smallest tyrannosaurs, nanotyrannus, are never than large in size, yet despite this stature, they no less ferocious, and those who would assume that a nanotyrannus is "safer" to train do well think again!
