    desc: "`pf2:2`  Hakusa rapidly strikes at pressure points to debilitate a foe. She makes a fingers Strike. On a hit, the target takes damage as normal and must attempt a `DC 43 Fortitude check` save. Regardless of the result of the save, the target is then temporarily immune to Pressure Point Attack for 1 minute.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The target's muscles become temporarily weaker. For 1 round, the target is [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 2]], and any time it attempts to take an action with the manipulate trait, the action is disrupted unless it succeeds at a flat check with a DC equal to 5 + its enfeebled value.\n\n**Failure** As success, but the duration is 1 minute.\n\n**Critical Failure** As success, but the duration is 1 minute, the flat check is DC 11, and the target takes a -10-foot status penalty to all Speeds for the duration."

    desc: "`pf2:2` (certain-kill,void) **Frequency** once per round\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Hakusa strikes a series of pressure points on her target's body that redirects its ki to the heart, before following up with a palm strike to the sternum. She makes a fingers Strike and a palm Strike, dealing damage as normal. If both hit, the target takes 8d10 void damage as its life energy escapes from its body in a shower of bird-shaped sparks. The target attempts a `DC 43 Fortitude check` save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The target takes half the void damage.\n\n**Failure** The target takes full damage, its life energy exploding violently from its back in a 30-foot cone originating from the target. All of Hakusa's other enemies in the cone also take the void damage (`DC 43 Fortitude check` save).\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target takes double void damage."
