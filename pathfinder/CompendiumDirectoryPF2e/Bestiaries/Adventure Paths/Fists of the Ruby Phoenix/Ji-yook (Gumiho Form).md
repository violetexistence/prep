    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,divine,polymorph) Ji-yook transforms into her human form. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the Impersonate use of Deception. Ji-yook can remain in her human form indefinitely, and she can shift back to her true kitsune form by using this action again.\n* * *\n\nThe monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

  - name: "Disquieting Change Shape"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,divine,polymorph) Ji-yook selects one enemy within 60 feet, then Changes Shape into humanoid form, taking the form of a person emotionally close to that enemy, such as a dead family member. Ji-yook is not aware of the form she will take until she transforms. If her target sees her, even if they are aware it is a trick, they must attempt a `DC 40 Will check` save or be [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]] ([[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] on a critical failure) for 1 round. This is a fear effect."

  - name: "Foxfire Blast"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (electricity,flourish,magical) Ji-yook makes a fist Strike. On a hit, the target takes an additional 3d6 electricity damage and is pushed back 5 feet. On a critical hit, the target is pushed back and then knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]"

  - name: "Pinning Shot"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  Ji-yook pins a foe's clothing to a wall or floor or the ground. Ji-yook makes a dart Strike. If the attack hits, it deals no damage and instead pins the target to an adjacent surface. The target is [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] and must spend an Interact action to attempt a `DC 10 Athletics check` check to pull the dart free; it can't move from its space until it succeeds. If Ji-yook's dart Strike was a critical hit, the target must succeed at two separate Athletics checks to pull the dart free. The target is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] while it remains immobilized in this way."

    desc: "  Ji-yook's Strikes deal an additional 4d6 precision damage to [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] creatures."

    desc: "`pf2:r` (emotion,fear) **Trigger** An enemy within 60 feet is the target of a Strike or attempts a Will save\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Just when an enemy is preparing to defend itself, Ji-yook sends an illusion of herself to whisper a disquieting secret or threat into their ear. The enemy takes a -2 circumstance penalty to their AC or Will save against the triggering attack or effect."
