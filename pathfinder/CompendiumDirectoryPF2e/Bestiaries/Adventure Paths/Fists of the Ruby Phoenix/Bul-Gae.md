Bul-gaes are manifestations of the eclipsed sun and moon. They resemble large canines, though their coloration and features change as they exercise their powers over heat and cold. Depending on whether they have most recently unleashed their lunar or solar powers, a bul-gae resembles either a crimson hound wreathed in flames or a cerulean, frostbitten fox, respectively.

Legends say that the first bul-gae attempted to steal the sun from the sky. As they bit down on the burning sphere, though, the bul-gae was badly burned. Having failed, they then tried to retrieve the moon, but when they touched the moon the bul-gae froze solid and fell to the ground. The descendants of that bul-gae forever hone their powers of flame and ice so that they may one day succeed where their ancestor failed.
