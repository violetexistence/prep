This is cumulative with other enfeebled conditions from shadows, to a maximum of enfeebled 4. If this increases a creature's enfeebled value to 3 or more, the target's shadow is separated from its body. Enfeebled from Steal Shadow decreases by 1 every hour."

Variant shadow

The mysterious undead known as shadows lurk in dark places and feed on those who stray too far from the light. Those who parley with shadows, typically by keeping them at bay with a glowing weapon, may learn great secrets, for they are ideal spies.
