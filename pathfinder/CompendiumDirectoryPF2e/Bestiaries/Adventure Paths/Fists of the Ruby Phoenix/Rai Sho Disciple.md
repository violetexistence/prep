  - name: "Nine Seals Spellcasting"
    desc: "  The Rai Sho disciples have learned a technique that allows them to cast their ki spells more effectively by way of specialized hand postures. They replace the normal somatic and verbal components of their spells with nine seals components; these require that the caster have a hand free, but don't add any traits to the Cast a Spell action (preventing the Rai Sho disciples from triggering certain reactions, such as Attack of Opportunity, when they Cast a Spell)."
