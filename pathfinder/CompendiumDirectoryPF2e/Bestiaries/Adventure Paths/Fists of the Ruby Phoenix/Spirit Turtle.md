Spirit turtles are benevolent fey known to heal those in need and confer other powerful gifts. These gentle giants resemble enormous turtles and often bear entire ecosystems on their shells.

In ancient times, so the legend goes, spirit turtles used to grant wishes to many mortals. After millennia of such encounters, the giant creatures grew tired and went into hiding or returned to their home plane, the First World. Those few spirit turtles who remain on Golarion now grant their favors only to the purest and worthiest mortal petitioners.
