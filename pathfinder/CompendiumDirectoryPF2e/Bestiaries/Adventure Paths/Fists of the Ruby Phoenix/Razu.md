    desc: "  Razu wields his instrument's unique rune- enchanted bow as a deadly weapon. His decades of training with the item allow him to augment it with his own battle cries so that it also deals sonic damage. By attaching the bow's case to its end, he can change the weapon's damage to piercing and use the bow much like a short spear. Any other creature who wields the erhu bow does not deal sonic damage with it, but the weapon otherwise possesses the traits listed above. If sold without its runes, the bow is worth 50 gp."
