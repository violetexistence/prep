The triggering creature must attempt a `DC 36 Fortitude check` save. The haunt can use this reaction any number of times per round, but only once per creature that tries to leave the room. The haunt then rolls initiative, if it hasn't already.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature is pulled 10 feet into the room.\n\n**Failure** The creature is pulled 15 feet into the room.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature is pulled 15 feet into the room, knocked prone, and takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage."

  - name: "Reset"
    desc: "The haunt deactivates after 1 minute. It re-forms at the same times every day, 7 a.m. and 7 p.m., which is when the monks had their morning and evening meals. If at least two people cook a meal in the kitchen, share a meal in the refectory, and utter a prayer to Irori before the meal, the haunt becomes permanently disabled and doesn't re-form."
