    desc: "three `DC 39 Athletics check` (trained), `DC 39 Crafting check` (trained), or Engineering Lore (trained) checks to brace a small structure or surface to cancel the effects of the quake in that area; `DC 41 Performance check` (legendary) to calm Mogaru momentarily"

    desc: "`pf2:r` **Trigger** Mogaru moves at least 60 feet\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The ground shakes in a 120-foot emanation from Mogaru's space. This creates a variety of effects, depending on where the player characters are at the time of the quake.\n\nIn most parts of the city, the ground becomes difficult terrain, and creatures on it are [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 2]] for 1 round.\n\nIn parts of the city with existing underground spaces (like sewers, sinkholes, or catacombs), fissures open up in the ground. Creatures in the area tumble into the resulting 40-foot-deep hole unless they succeed at a `DC 40 Reflex check` save.\n\nIn bays, on beaches, and in other relatively substantial but shallow bodies of water, Mogaru's movement creates dangerous waves. Creatures in the water or within 60 feet of the waterline are struck by waves that deal 3d8 bludgeoning damage (`DC 35 Reflex check` save). On a critically failed save, a creature is instantly swept 60 feet out to sea and 60 feet under the water's surface."
