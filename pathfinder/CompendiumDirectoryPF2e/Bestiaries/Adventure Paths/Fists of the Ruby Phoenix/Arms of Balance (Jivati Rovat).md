    desc: "`pf2:2` (fire) The monk lets loose a powerful breath of air, whose effect depends on the type of energy to which the monk is attuned. The monk can't use this ability again for 1d4 rounds.\n\nJivati's breath ignites a fire in the spirit of each creature within 10 feet of Jivati, dealing 8d6 fire damage. Each creature in the area must attempt a `DC 33 Will check` save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature takes half damage.\n\n**Failure** The creature takes full damage and 1d6 persistent fire damage and loses 1 Focus Point. If it has no Focus Points, the creature instead loses a random prepared spell or spell slot from the highest level it has left (maximum 6th level).\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature takes double damage and 2d6 persistent fire damage."
