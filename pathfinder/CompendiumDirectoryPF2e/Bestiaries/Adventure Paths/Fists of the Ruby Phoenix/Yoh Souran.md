    desc: "`pf2:2` (manipulate) **Requirements** Yoh is piloting an airborne vessel\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Yoh pumps the brakes, banks quickly, or performs some other aerial maneuver to get the drop on an enemy. He attempts a Piloting Lore check against the enemy's Perception DC. If he succeeds, that enemy is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] to the next attack from a creature onboard as long as it is made before Yoh's next turn. All enemies who witnessed the maneuver are then temporarily immune for 1 day."
