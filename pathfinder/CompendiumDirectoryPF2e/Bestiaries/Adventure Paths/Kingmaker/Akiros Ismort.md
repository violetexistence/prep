    desc: " (emotion,mental,visual) If Akiros sees another creature openly wearing Erastil's holy symbol, he must attempt a `DC 15 Will check` save. Unless he critically fails his saving throw, he is temporarily immune to Shameful Memories for 24 hours.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** Akiros is unaffected.\n\n**Success** Akiros is distracted by shame and becomes [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] for 1 round.\n\n**Failure** Akiros becomes [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]] with his shame.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but Akiros is [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]] as well. He does not become temporarily immune to Shameful Memories, and he can be affected by this weakness again; this likely means he will have to immediately attempt the save again once he recovers from the stun."
