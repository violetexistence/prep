    desc: "Whenever a First World army scores a critical hit on another army, it increases that army's [[Kingmaker Features/Weary|Weary]] condition by 1 as their attacks cause some soldiers to become poisoned, fall asleep, shrink in size, or suffer other eerie side effects."

  - name: "Tactical Training"
    desc: "The First World Army can use the following tactical actions: [[Kingmaker Features/Counterattack|Counterattack]], [[Kingmaker Features/Dirty Fighting|Dirty Fighting]], [[Kingmaker Features/Feint|Feint]], and [[Kingmaker Features/Taunt|Taunt]].\n* * *\n\n_**Note**: This tactic also grants the army a +1 bonus to attacks in order to keep its attack bonus in line with the statistics given in the Kingmaker adventure._"

  - name: "Battlefield Adaptability"
    desc: "`pf2:1` The First World army has a wide range of creatures in its ranks, and it can shift its tactics to support those with different mobilities. It can take this action to achieve one of the following benefits: Ignore ground-based difficult terrain, reduce [[Kingmaker Features/Mired|Mired]] to 0, become [[Kingmaker Features/Concealed|Concealed]], or gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Maneuver checks to Advance and to Disengage. The effect lasts until the start of the First World Army's next turn."

  - name: "Primal Magic"
    desc: "`pf2:2` **Requirement** The First World army is not [[Kingmaker Features/Engaged|Engaged]];\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The First World army uses its primal magic against another army on the battlefield and must attempt a Morale check against the target's Morale DC. If they succeed, the First World army applies one of the following effects, determined randomly (1d10), to the target army.\n\n**1–2 Entangling Vines** Coils of whipping vines grow out of the ground to entangle the army. The army increases its [[Kingmaker Features/Mired|Mired]] condition by 1 (2 on a critical hit).\n\n**3–4 Horrific Visions** The soldiers' minds are assaulted with horrific illusions. The army increases its [[Kingmaker Features/Shaken|Shaken]] condition by 1 (2 on a critical hit).\n\n**5–6 Primal Storm** A churning storm cloud above the army strikes the soldiers dozens of times with bolts of lightning, inflicting 1 point of damage to the army (2 points of damage on a critical hit). Until the end of the targeted army's next turn, it functions as if in high wind and rain (see Battlefield Terrain Features on page 578).\n\n**7–8 Sensory Assault** The soldiers become overwhelmed with strange lights or tricked by illusions. Until the end of their next turn, the army takes a –2 circumstance penalty on all attacks and Maneuver checks.\n\n**9–10 Overwhelming Magic** Roll twice and apply both results, but the First World army suffers a –4 circumstance penalty on its Morale check against the target army's Morale DC."

  - name: "Counterattack"
    desc: "`pf2:r` **Requirement** [[Kingmaker Features/Flexible Tactics|Flexible Tactics]]\n\n**Trigger** An army you are engaged with attempts a maneuver war action.\n* * *\n\nYour army lashes out at the foe as they attempt to perform a maneuver. Attempt a melee Strike against the triggering army's AC. Counterattack doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike.\n\n**Critical Success** You inflict 1 point of damage on the army and increase its [[Kingmaker Features/Shaken|Shaken]] condition value by 1.\n\n**Success** You inflict 1 point of damage on the army."

  - name: "Dirty Fighting"
    desc: "`pf2:1` **Requirement** [[Kingmaker Features/Flexible Tactics|Flexible Tactics]]\n* * *\n\nYour army uses trickery, deception, and unfair tactics to attempt a devastating attack against an outflanked army. Attempt a melee Strike or a ranged Strike against the AC of a target outflanked army that is not distant.\n\n**Critical Success** The target army becomes [[Kingmaker Features/Weary|Weary 2]] until the start of your next turn.\n\n**Success** The target army becomes weary 1 until the start of your next turn.\n\n**Critical Failure** Your attack deals no damage to the target army, which is emboldened by your failed attempt at dirty fighting. This reduces the target army's weary value by 1."

  - name: "Feint"
    desc: "`pf2:1` Requirement Flexible Tactics Your army launches a probing attack meant to trick the enemy into thinking you are attacking from one quarter while your real thrust comes elsewhere. Critical Success The target army's defenses are thrown off; it is outflanked until the end of your turn. Success The target army is fooled, but only momentarily. It is outflanked against the next melee Strike your army attempts against it before the end of your current turn. Critical Failure The enemy anticipates your feint and presses the advantage. You are outflanked by the target army until the end of your next turn."

  - name: "Taunt"
    desc: "`pf2:1` **Requirement**[[Kingmaker Features/Focused Devotion|Focused Devotion]]\n* * *\n\nYour army attempts to frighten and cow an enemy army. Attempt a `Morale check` check against the target army.\n\n**Critical Success** The target army becomes [[Kingmaker Features/Shaken|Shaken 2]] until the start of your next turn.\n\n**Success** The target army becomes shaken 1 until the start of your next turn.\n\n**Critical Failure** Your failed attempt bolsters the enemy's spirits. This reduces the target army's shaken value by 1."

  - name: "Swift Recovery"
    desc: "`pf2:2` **Frequency** once per battle;\n\n**Effect** The army calls upon its magical connection to the First World to recover. This either restores 2 hit points or reduces the army's [[Kingmaker Features/Weary|Weary]] condition value by 2."
