    desc: " (divine) When a skeletal Tiger Lord is destroyed, its bones clatter to the ground in a tangle and its armor and weapons crumble to dust. It automatically reforms with its armor and weapons intact (regaining a full quiver of 20 arrows) 1 hour later at 1 Hit Point, allowing its fast healing to resume healing it thereafter. If the trap in area **D5** is disabled, the skeleton loses this ability; otherwise, the only way to permanently destroy a skeletal Tiger Lord is to reduce it to 0 Hit Points with vitality damage or a holy effect."
