  - name: "Shame"
    desc: "  A ghostly guard suffers from shame when it attacks a target that appears to be an elf or a worshipper of Calistria. Forgive Foe can be attempted against a ghostly guard with a `DC 39 Diplomacy check` check or `DC 39 Society check` check. If a ghostly guard is affected by a critical success from Forgive Foe, it sighs in relief as it fades away, its soul released into the afterlife."

  - name: "[[Creature Family Ability Glossary/(Ghost) Site Bound|Site Bound]]"
    desc: "  A typical ghost can stray only a short distance from where it was killed or the place it haunts. A typical limit is 120 feet. Some ghosts are instead bound to a room, building, item, or creature that was special to it rather than a location."

  - name: "[[Creature Family Ability Glossary/(Ghost) Rejuvenation|Rejuvenation]]"
    desc: " (divine) Slaying or forgiving Nyrissa allows the ghostly guards to move on to their long-delayed afterlives, as does achieving a critical success with Forgive Foe.\n* * *\n\nWhen a ghost is destroyed, it re-forms after 2d4 days within the location it's bound to, fully healed. A ghost can be permanently destroyed only if someone determines the reason for its existence and sets right whatever prevents the spirit from resting."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Void Healing|Void Healing]]"
    desc: "  A creature with void healing draws health from void energy rather than vitality energy. It is damaged by vitality damage and is not healed by vitality healing effects. It does not take void damage, and it is healed by void effects that heal undead."

  - name: "Ectoplasmic Maneuver"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (attack) The ghostly guard lashes out with a whipping strand of solid ectoplasm against a target within 15 feet, in an attempt to [[Actions/Disarm|Disarm]], [[Actions/Shove|Shove]], or [[Actions/Trip|Trip]] the foe. It uses its ghostly rapier Strike rather than an Athletics check to determine the results of this attempt."

  - name: "[[Creature Family Ability Glossary/(Ghost) Frightful Moan|Frightful Moan]]"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (auditory,divine,emotion,fear,mental) The ghost laments its fate, forcing each living creature within 30 feet to attempt a `DC 36 Will check` save. On a failure, a creature becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] (or [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 3]] on a critical failure). On a success, a creature is temporarily immune to this ghost's frightful moan for 1 minute."
