    desc: "The Drelev Irregulars are composed of equal parts Tiger Lords and mercenaries who were once bandits. Their fighting style is more akin to a mob than a disciplined force; while this allows the irregulars an advantage in mobility, it decentralizes their command structure and lessens their morale."

    desc: "`pf2:2` **Requirement** [[Kingmaker Features/Merciless|Merciless]]\n* * *\n\nYour army attacks with frightening vigor. Attempt a melee Strike against an enemy army's AC.\n\n**Critical Success** Your army inflicts 3 points of damage to the target army. If your army's next war action this turn is an attack war action against a different target army, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the Strike as your fury continues to the new target.\n\n**Success** Your army deals 2 points of damage to the target army.\n\n**Failure** Your army falters, but still deals 1 point of damage to the target army.\n\n**Critical Failure** Your army deals no damage to the target army and becomes [[Kingmaker Features/Outflanked|Outflanked]] until the start of its next turn."

    desc: "`pf2:r` **Requirement** [[Kingmaker Features/Flexible Tactics|Flexible Tactics]]\n\n**Trigger** An army you are engaged with attempts a maneuver war action.\n* * *\n\nYour army lashes out at the foe as they attempt to perform a maneuver. Attempt a melee Strike against the triggering army's AC. Counterattack doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike.\n\n**Critical Success** You inflict 1 point of damage on the army and increase its [[Kingmaker Features/Shaken|Shaken]] condition value by 1.\n\n**Success** You inflict 1 point of damage on the army."

  - name: "Dirty Fighting"
    desc: "`pf2:1` **Requirement** [[Kingmaker Features/Flexible Tactics|Flexible Tactics]]\n* * *\n\nYour army uses trickery, deception, and unfair tactics to attempt a devastating attack against an outflanked army. Attempt a melee Strike or a ranged Strike against the AC of a target outflanked army that is not distant.\n\n**Critical Success** The target army becomes [[Kingmaker Features/Weary|Weary 2]] until the start of your next turn.\n\n**Success** The target army becomes weary 1 until the start of your next turn.\n\n**Critical Failure** Your attack deals no damage to the target army, which is emboldened by your failed attempt at dirty fighting. This reduces the target army's weary value by 1."
