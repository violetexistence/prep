    desc: "`DC 23 Thievery check` (expert) to disarm the trap's sensors in the chamber floor, or [[Spells/Dispel Magic|Dispel Magic]] (3rd rank; counteract DC 23) to counteract the faces. Breaking one of the faces on the walls reduces the trap's save DC, attack rolls, and its total actions by 1 per broken face; if all four faces are destroyed, the trap is disabled."

Each creature must succeed at a `DC 22 Fortitude check` save or become [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]] ([[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 2]] on a critical failure)."

  - name: "Routine"
    desc: "(4 actions) The trap loses 1 action per disabled face each turn. On each action, a different face spews a writhing breath of darkness from its mouth to a target in the area. A creature can only be targeted once per round by the despairing breath, so if fewer than four creatures are in the room, the trap won't be able to take full advantage of all four of its actions."
