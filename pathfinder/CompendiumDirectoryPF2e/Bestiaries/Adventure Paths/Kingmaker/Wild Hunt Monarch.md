    desc: "`pf2:1` (primal,teleportation) The wild hunt monarch wields a magic weapon known as a monarch's glaive. This weapon functions as a _+3 major striking greater thundering wounding glaive_ in the monarch's hands only. The monarch can call their glaive to their hands using this action, transporting it across any distance. If their glaive is destroyed, the monarch can create a new one by using Call Glaive as a three-action activity that gains the manipulate trait."

  - name: "Call to the Hunt"
    desc: "`pf2:3` (manipulate,primal,teleportation) **Frequency** once per day\n\n**Effect** The wild hunt monarch blows their monarch's horn, causing two wild hunt scouts or four wild hunt archers part of the monarch's wild hunt link and no more than 1 mile from the monarch's location to appear as the monarch chooses at any point within 30 feet. They act immediately before the wild hunt monarch in initiative starting on the next round."

  - name: "Focus Gaze"

The target must immediately attempt a Will save against the wild hunt hound's wild gaze. If the creature was already slowed by the wild gaze before attempting its save, a failed save causes it to be [[Conditions/Paralyzed|Paralyzed]] for 1 round. After attempting its save, the creature is temporarily immune to Focus Gaze from any wild hunt until the start of the wild hunt monarch's next turn."

  - name: "Wild Reincarnation"
    desc: "`pf2:r` (primal) **Trigger** The wild hunt monarch kills an adjacent non-fey creature.\n\n**Effect** The wild hunt monarch attempts to reincarnate the creature as a fey. The slain creature must attempt a `DC 42 Fortitude check` save, and it takes a -2 status penalty to this save if it was under any enchantment effect placed by the monarch when it died.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is instead restored to life as if via [[Spells/Raise Dead|Raise Dead]] (heightened to 10th level), and it is permanently immune to Wild Reincarnation from that wild hunt monarch.\n\n**Success** The creature is not reincarnated and remains dead.\n\n**Failure** The creature is temporarily reincarnated as a fey creature of the monarch's choice. The new fey must be of a level equal to or less than the dead creature's level, and it functions in all ways as that fey creature; it retains none of the abilities and only scatterings of the memories or personality of the reincarnated character, and it follows the commands and orders of the wild hunt monarch. After 1 minute, the reincarnated fey dies and its body reverts back to its original corpse, which can then be restored to life normally.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the reincarnated fey remains alive until slain; a [[Spells/Miracle|Miracle]], [[Spells/Wish|Wish]] or similarly powerful spell or effect can reverse the reincarnation as well."

Each wild hunt follows a wild hunt monarch, who travels between the realm of the fey and the Material Plane in search of new quarry. These limber and regal humanoids have elk antlers, long pointed ears, flowing white hair, and luminescent green eyes.

Although some believe the wild hunt is nothing more than legend, the riders of the wild hunt are real. Countless members of these fey compose the wild hunt-the term "wild hunt" refers to the family of creatures as a whole as well as to individual groups of these fey who gather to pursue their quarry.

Wild hunt monarchs set the terms of each specific hunt, depending upon the prey and their own whims. The easier the prey, the more likely a monarch is to impose rules to make the hunt more entertaining, such as forbidding anyone but their hounds from injuring the quarry, or holding back their forces to give the target creature time to rest and recover.

While most missions come from rumors gathered by a wild hunt monarch, monarchs occasionally consider proposals from the few who are brave and knowledgeable enough to seek them out. They accept tasks only from sources they deem worthy, and the payments they demand for their services vary significantly, though they have no interest in material wealth. Wild hunt monarchs take grave offense at unfavorable deals. Those who attempt to cheat a monarch often become the enraged fey's next target.
