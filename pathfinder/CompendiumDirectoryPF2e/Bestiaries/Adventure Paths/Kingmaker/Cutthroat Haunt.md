    desc: "`pf2:r` (divine) **Trigger** A creature comes within 5 feet of the bloodstain\n* * *\n\n**Effect** A spectral sickle manifests behind the triggering creature, then slices around to cut at that creature's throat. The target must attempt a `DC 39 Fortitude check` save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The target takes 4d10 void damage.\n\n**Failure** The target takes 4d10+35 void damage and is [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]]. An eerie white scar manifests on the target's neck; this scar persists as long as the drained effect caused by this haunt lasts.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure but 4d10+70 void damage and [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 2]]. The eerie white scar periodically appears to drip with blood, but this is purely an unsettling cosmetic side-effect; it does no additional damage to the victim."
