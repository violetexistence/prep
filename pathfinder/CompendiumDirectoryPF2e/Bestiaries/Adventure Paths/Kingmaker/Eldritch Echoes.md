    desc: "(1 action; emotion, enchantment, mental, primal) The trap starts scrambling senses and forcing creatures to perceive threats to their very place in time and space where no such threats actually exist. Every creature in area **K13** must attempt a `DC 42 Will check` saving throw.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature is [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] for 1 round.\n\n**Failure** As success, but the creature is also [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]] as long as it remains stupefied.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] and confused. The confused condition persists until the creature recovers normally, but the stupefaction effect is permanent until removed."
