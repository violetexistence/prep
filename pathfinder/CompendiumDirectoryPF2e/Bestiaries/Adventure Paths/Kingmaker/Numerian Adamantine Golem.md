    desc: "  Harmed by acid (9d10 untyped, 2d10 untyped from areas or persistent damage); healed by fire (area 2d10 healing HP); slowed by electricity\n* * *\n\nA golem is immune to spells and magical abilities other than its own, but each type of golem is affected by a few types of magic in special ways. These exceptions are listed in shortened form in the golem's stat block, with the full rules appearing here. If an entry lists multiple types (such as \"cold and water\"), either type of spell can affect the golem.\n\n*   **Harmed By** Any magic of this type that targets the golem causes it to take the listed amount of damage (this damage has no type) instead of the usual effect. If the golem starts its turn in an area of magic of this type or is affected by a persistent effect of the appropriate type, it takes the damage listed in the parenthetical.\n*   **Healed By** Any magic of this type that targets the golem makes the golem lose the slowed condition and gain HP equal to half the damage the spell would have dealt. If the golem starts its turn in an area of this type of magic, it gains the HP listed in the parenthetical.\n*   **Slowed By** Any magic of this type that targets the golem causes it to be [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] for 2d6 rounds instead of the usual effect. If the golem starts its turn in an area of this type of magic, it's slowed 1 for that round.\n*   **Vulnerable To** Each golem is vulnerable to one or more specific spells, with the effects described in its stat block."

    desc: "  Any encounters with adamantine golems, guthallaths, or radiant wardens in Numeria are with ancient robotic versions of these creatures. In encounters with them, describe them as having more technological aspects. The guthallath's erosion aura could be caused by clouds of deconstructor nanites and its annihilation beams manifest as plasma blasts. The adamantine golem might have tank treads instead of legs and its vent ability might manifest as a spray of dozens of laser beams in a cone. And the radiant warden's radiant beams and blast serve as rippling attacks of focused graviton beams.\n\nAll of these constructs have weakness 15 to critical hits and electricity, but their other statistics do not change. If you'd rather not introduce Numeria's themes of super-science and strange technology, you can either present these constructs as standard versions, or re-roll your encounter to get a more appropriate result for your game."

  - name: "Repair Mode"
    desc: "  When the adamantine golem is at 0 HP, it isn't destroyed. Instead, it enters repair mode, during which it is [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]], can't take reactions, and can take only the Self-Repair action.\n\nOnce it has more than 30 HP, it can use any type of action and can use reactions, though it remains slowed 1 and can't take any reactions until the start of its next turn.\n\nIf a critical hit with an adamantine _[[Equipment/Vorpal|Vorpal]]_ weapon reduces the golem to 0 HP, or if such a weapon hits it while it's already at 0 HP, then the golem is destroyed."

  - name: "Vulnerable to Dispelling"
    desc: "  The golem can be targeted by [[Spells/Disjunction|Disjunction]] and [[Spells/Dispel Magic|Dispel Magic]].\n\nIf targeted by such a spell of 9th level or higher, the golem has its resistance to physical damage lowered to 15 and is [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] (or [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 2]] if in repair mode) for 1d4 rounds. During this time, if the golem is reduced to 0 HP while already in repair mode, it is destroyed."

Crafted from a nigh-indestructible metal of great rarity, adamantine golems can't be destroyed except by the most powerful foes. Crafting an adamantine golem requires a quantity of adamantine so massive that collecting it usually requires mounting a mining expedition to a distant planet, the Plane of Earth, or an Outer Plane.

* * *

Crafted of base materials and then magically animated into a powerful guardian, the legendary golem is a living construct that mindlessly obeys its creator's commands-often continuing to do so for years or even centuries after its creator's death. There exist two known methods of animating a golem. The traditional method involves harvesting and implanting an elemental soul or essence within the newly crafted host statue, a procedure seen as vile and blasphemous to those who value the sanctity of the soul; evil or amoral golem crafters tend to prefer this method. The other, less disreputable technique involves siphoning pure vitality energy into the statue to artificially imitate the creation of a soul. The result does not give the golem a true soul and is generally a more costly and time-consuming method of creation. Regardless of the method used, the resulting golem functions the same. A golem's unique animating force leaves it susceptible to certain forms of magic, but apart from these few weaknesses, it is impervious to magic and difficult to damage with weapons.

Golems work best in play as foes to vanquish rather than allies to accompany player characters on adventures. The process of creating a golem is time-consuming, expensive, and difficult, and only the most talented spellcasters or artisans can even hope to accomplish such an undertaking. While certain magical texts-so-called "golem manuals"-are said to aid golems crafters, for the most part the creation of a golem should be something left in the hands of the Game Master.

Golems have components that can be harvested as trophies or magical components; the value depends on the golem in question. Examples of components that can be harvested from golems are listed in the sidebars.
