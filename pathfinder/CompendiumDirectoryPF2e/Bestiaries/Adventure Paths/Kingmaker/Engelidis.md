    desc: " (mental,occult) A spirit naga adds [[Spells/Hallucination|Hallucination]], [[Spells/Mind Probe|Mind Probe]], and [[Spells/Suggestion|Suggestion]] to their coven's spells.\n* * *\n\nThis monster can form a coven with two or more other creatures who also have the coven ability. This involves performing an 8-hour ceremony with all prospective coven members. After the coven is formed, each of its members gains elite adjustments, adjusting their levels accordingly. Coven members can sense other members' locations and conditions by spending a single action, which has the concentrate trait, and can sense what another coven member is sensing as a two-action activity, which has the concentrate trait as well.\n\nCovens also grant spells and rituals to their members, but these can be cast only in cooperation between three coven members who are all within 30 feet of one another. A coven member can contribute to a coven spell with a single action that has the concentrate trait. If two coven members have contributed these actions within the last round, a third member can cast a coven spell on her turn by spending the normal spellcasting actions. A coven can cast its coven spells an unlimited number of times but can cast only one coven spell each round. All covens grant the 8th-rank [[Spells/Cursed Metamorphosis|Cursed Metamorphosis]] spell and all the following spells, which the coven can cast at any rank up to 5th: [[Spells/Augury|Augury]], [[Spells/Charm|Charm]], [[Spells/Clairaudience|Clairaudience]], [[Spells/Clairvoyance|Clairvoyance]], [[Spells/Dream Message|Dream Message]], [[Spells/Illusory Disguise|Illusory Disguise]], [[Spells/Illusory Scene|Illusory Scene]], [[Spells/Scouting Eye|Scouting Eye]], and [[Spells/Talking Corpse|Talking Corpse]]. Individual creatures with the coven ability also grant additional spells to any coven they join. A coven can also cast the [[Spells/Control Weather|Control Weather]] ritual, with a DC of 23 instead of the standard DC.\n\nIf a coven member's departure or death brings the coven below three members, the remaining members keep their elite adjustments for 24 hours, but without enough members to contribute the necessary actions, they can't cast coven spells."

Variant female spirit naga

In naga culture, the foul-tempered, unkempt spirit naga holds a contemptible place similar to that of hags in humanoid cultures. These decrepit creatures live out lives of solitude, sought out only by those who are foolish or brave enough to think they can benefit from the spirit naga's powers without paying a heavy price-for most who dare to show such hubris, the price is their own lives.

Spirit nagas seek out desolate ruins and places long associated with death and corruption. These sinister, serpentine beings can be found in abandoned graveyards, crumbled fortresses, rotting swamps, and blighted woodlands. Though they may know little of the actual history of such places, the nagas are nonetheless attracted to the psychic remnants of evil deeds and tormented spirits that remain within the earth and stones there.

Despite their hideous appearance and treatment as pariahs by other nagas, spirit nagas feel a profound pride in their abilities and even in their hermetic existences. They see themselves as connected to a greater force whose mysteries are revealed only to those who can cast off the trappings and morals of "civilized" society. Even so, spirit nagas gleefully accept the worship of other creatures willing to bow to their capricious whims. They often form cults around themselves, using their charm spells and rituals to ensnare the minds of a few key individuals who spread the nagas' foul influence throughout a community.

* * *

Nagas are identifiable by their serpentine bodies and strange, humanlike heads. All nagas have magical abilities and great intelligence, which they combine to advance their own agendas.
