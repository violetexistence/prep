Bandersnatches are consummate hunters, and only the deadliest predators or the most cunning intelligent prey offer them sport. A bandersnatch resembles a tawny, six-legged, earless great cat, but with wickedly barbed quills running the length of its body and down to the tip of its long, flexible tail. It measures 40 feet in length plus another 10 feet of tail and weighs 12,000 pounds. Primal bandersnatches are among the most powerful of their kind, due to their ties to the First World.
