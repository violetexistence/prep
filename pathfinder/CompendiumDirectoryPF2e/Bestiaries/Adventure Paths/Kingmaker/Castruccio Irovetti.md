Male human king

Since his flight from Numeria, Castruccio Irovetti has ruled Pitax for over half a decade, and in that time, he has firmly established his hold over this River Kingdom's political scene through a mix of cunning choice and luck. While he does have the support of the nymph Nyrissa, he hid from her the fact that he's managed to recover the magical sword she charged him with retrieving, making him loath to call upon her for aid. Furthermore, if he can defeat the PCs, surely that show of strength will bolster his reputation in her eyes, so that he can then present _Briar_ to her for an even greater reward. In Nyrissa, Irovetti sees the only candidate he could imagine taking on as his Queen.
