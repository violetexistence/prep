  - name: "Ambush"
    desc: "Your skirmishers are experts at ambushing. On the first round of a war encounter, if your turn occurs before any enemy army turns, you can choose to start the encounter with your army already engaged with an enemy army whose initiative result is lower than yours. If you do so, your army gains a +2 status bonus on the first Attack war action they make against that army on the first round of the encounter."

  - name: "Sharpshooter"
    desc: "The commander drills the army in precision ranged attacks. You gain a +1 status bonus on attacks with ranged Strikes, but suffer a –2 status bonus on attacks with melee Strikes. At 9th level, the penalty to melee Strikes is reduced to –1, and at 15th level the penalty to melee Strikes is removed.\n\nThe army can use the [[Kingmaker Features/Covering Fire|Covering Fire]] tactical war action."
