  - name: "Unseen Sight"
    desc: "  The removal of the eyes symbolized a Thresholder's abandonment of all they had seen before, and with the ritual's completion they gain something greater than mere vision: they gain the Unseen Sight. This is a precise sense that mimics darkvision yet functions even if the eye sockets themselves are covered. More importantly, the unseen sight allows a Thresholder to see the truth of the world, granting them the ability to see things as they actually are as if they were under the effects of [[Spells/Truesight|Truesight]], provided they are located within a region under the influence of Yog- Sothoth."
