    desc: "`pf2:r`  **Trigger** A creature within the monster's reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The monster attempts a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, the monster disrupts that action. This Strike doesn't count toward the monster's multiple attack penalty, and its multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike."

    desc: "`pf2:2`  **Requirements** Volodmyra is wielding her greataxe and is adjacent to an enemy\n\n**Effect** Volodmyra raises her greataxe above her head and puts all of her might into a single attack. If the attack hits, Volodmyra deals an additional 8 points of damage and the opponent must succeed at a `DC 17 Fortitude check` save to avoid being knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]."

  - name: "Spinning Sweep"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** Volodmyra successfully Strikes a second enemy when making a sweep attack with her axe and is within 10 feet of a third enemy she hasn't yet attacked\n\n**Effect** Volodmyra spins in a circle (Stepping 5 feet if she chooses) and makes a third attack against a foe she hasn't attacked this round. This third attack suffers only a -8 penalty to the attack roll (instead of the standard -10 on a third Strike). If it hits, Volodmyra deals an additional 2d6 points of damage from the furious impact."
