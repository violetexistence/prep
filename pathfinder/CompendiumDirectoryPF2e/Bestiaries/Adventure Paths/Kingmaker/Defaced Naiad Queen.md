  - name: "Shame"
    desc: "  A defaced naiad queen suffers from shame when it attacks any target that can cast primal spells, any fey creature, or any creature that can cast divine spells and worships a deity or faith associated with nature or the First World (such as Gozreh, one of the Eldest, or the Green Faith). [[Adventure-Specific Actions/Forgive Foe|Forgive Foe]] can be attempted against a defaced naiad queen with a `DC 36 Diplomacy check` check or Nature check. If a defaced naiad queen is affected by a critical success from Forgive Foe, its eyes are restored and it cries out in relief an instant before it vanishes, returning to the First World as a chaotic neutral naiad queen. As it does so, a wave of emotional thanks and inspiration infuse the character who used Forgive Foe, granting them a +3 status bonus to Lore checks and saves against fear effects for 24 hours.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Forgiven Defaced Naiad Queen's Thanks|Effect: Forgiven Defaced Naiad Queen's Thanks]]"

Variant female naiad queen

Naiad queens rule over pristine wildernesses centered on untouched lakes or other bodies of fresh water. Bards' songs and artists' paintings of nymphs tend to depict naiad queens in their slightly more humanoid forms, which they don when they make the rare journey into civilized lands to garner allies or gauge threats.

Most naiad queens treat those who respect their domains with kindness, but they are fierce and quick in eliminating foes. Their blinding beauty and breadth of offensive spells make naiad queens fierce opponents if forced into a fight.

* * *

Nymphs are a family of fey that take the form of beautiful humanoids with elven features and have a deep association with the natural world. The most common of their kind are the dryads, which are spirits that embody great trees, but many other kinds of nymphs exist, including naiads, who watch over bodies of water. All nymphs are guardians of some element of nature, typically a specific tree or pond, or even-in the case of nymph queens-whole forests or massive bodies of water
