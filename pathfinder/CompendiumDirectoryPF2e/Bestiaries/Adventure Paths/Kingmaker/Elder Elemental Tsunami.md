Variant elemental tsunami

Elemental tsunamis are huge and destructive.

Water elementals can be very destructive, but often not intentionally so; just as water can bring life to those in need on the Material Plane, its waves can pound shores and rains can flood cities. Water elementals are similarly difficult to predict.
