    desc: "`pf2:r` **Trigger** A creature within the pit takes three consecutive Interact actions to push their way through the barrier in the pit\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The creature is pulled through the portal into the depths of space. It can attempt to [[Actions/grab-an-edge dc=42|grab-an-edge dc=42]] with a DC 42 Reflex save, otherwise it discovers the portal is one-way—no return route to Golarion exists. The creature takes 10d6 bludgeoning damage (`DC 42 Fortitude check`) at the start of each turn and begins to suffocate. Without powerful magic like [[Spells/Interplanar Teleport|Interplanar Teleport]] or [[Spells/Wish|Wish]], even a creature that can survive the depths of space will be lost forever—as the Void Pit deposits them in the unimaginably vast gulf between galaxies in which sound cannot exist, where they cannot cast spells with verbal components."
