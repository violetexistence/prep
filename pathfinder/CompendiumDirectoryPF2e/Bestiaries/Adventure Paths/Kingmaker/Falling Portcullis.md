    desc: "`pf2:r` **Trigger** The trip wire is pulled or severed (typically by a person walking through the archway)\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The portcullis comes crashing down, sealing the entrance and alerting the denizens of the keep to the intruder's presence. Any creature passing under the portcullis or standing below it must attempt a `DC 27 Reflex check` save. Once it falls, the portcullis can be lifted with a `DC 30 Athletics check` check to [[Actions/Force Open|Force it Open]], or via the winch.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature dodges aside into an adjacent square (the player chooses which square they end up in).\n\n**Success** As critical success, but the creature takes a glancing blow from the falling portcullis and takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage.\n\n**Failure** As critical success, but the creature takes a solid blow from the falling portcullis and takes 4d8+18 bludgeoning damage.\n\n**Critical Failure** The portcullis lands squarely on the creature, inflicting 6d8+18 piercing damage and [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilizing]] them. A Medium or smaller creature is also knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]."
