    desc: "`pf2:r` **Trigger** A non-native of Thousandbreaths attempts to take a teleportation action that either begins or ends in any area within the House at the Edge of Time\n\n**Effect** The House redirects the magic to cause the creature that attempted the Teleportation action to instead teleport into themselves a split second before they attempted the action in the first place. The creature must attempt a `DC 41 Will check` save. A PC under the protection of the Helix Theorem gains their +4 status bonus to this saving throw, and treats all Critical Failure results as Failure results instead.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The action functions normally.\n\n**Success** The action fails but doesn't harm anyone.\n\n**Failure** The action fails, and the creature that attempted it (but not any other creature targeted by the action) teleports into themselves, suffering a sudden and agonizing pain, taking 4d10 + 40 bludgeoning damage, 4d10 mental damage, and becoming [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]].\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but affecting all creatures that would have been affected by the attempted action, and the creature that attempted the action instead takes 80 bludgeoning damage, 40 mental damage, and is [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 4]]."
