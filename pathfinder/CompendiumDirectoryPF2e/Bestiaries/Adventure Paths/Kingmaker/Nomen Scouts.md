    desc: "Nomen scouts are adept at providing for themselves, and never count against the kingdom's consumption. Furthermore, they can provide for other armies, and as long as they are not defeated during a Kingdom turn's Upkeep phase, they reduce the kingdom's consumption value by 1."

    desc: "Nomen Scouts can attempt to trample an engaged enemy army by attempting a +20 melee Strike against the army's AC. On a hit, they inflict 1 point of damage (2 points on a critical hit) and automatically move away from the army—they are no longer engaged with that army."
