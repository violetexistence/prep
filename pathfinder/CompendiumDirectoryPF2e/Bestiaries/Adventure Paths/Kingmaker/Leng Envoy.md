  - name: "Leng Ruby"
    desc: " (occult) Many denizens of Leng carry strange rubies mined from quarries in Leng. As long as a creature holds a Leng ruby that it willingly accepted as a gift or payment from a denizen of Leng, any denizen of Leng can target that creature with [[Spells/Mind Reading|Mind Reading]], [[Spells/Outcast's Curse|Outcast's Curse]], [[Spells/Phantom Pain|Phantom Pain]], or [[Spells/Warp Mind|Warp Mind]] at a range of 1 mile, and the bearer uses an outcome one degree of success worse than the result of its saving throw against _Outcast's Curse_."

  - name: "Play the Pipes"
    desc: "`pf2:3` (auditory,primal) **Frequency** once per day\n\n**Requirements** The Leng envoy is holding a musical instrument\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The envoy plays a melody on its instrument to cast [[Spells/Uncontrollable Dance|Uncontrollable Dance]], [[Spells/Unfathomable Song|Unfathomable Song]], or [[Spells/Warp Mind|Warp Mind]] without expending the spell slot and using his music in place of providing the spell's component actions. The spell gains the auditory trait and targets all creatures in a 60-foot emanation instead of its usual targets. A creature that succeeds at its Will save against any spell is then temporarily immune from all spells played from the envoy's pipes for 1 minute. Aberrations are immune to this music."

Variant denizen of Leng

Slavers and raiders from the cold, windswept dimension of Leng, these malevolent humanoids range across reality in ominous black ships capable of sailing beyond the borders of dimensions and planes. Although most denizens of Leng seek slaves and plunder like any pirate, others operate as self-styled ambassadors and merchants, sowing discord with far-ranging plots. While the inscrutable denizens dress themselves in flowing robes, veils, and broad turbans to appear human, their aberrant physiology, when glimpsed, is evident from their crown of stubby horns and tentacled jaws to their furry, goat-like legs.

Above the fierce captains who command the infamous black ships are an even higher caste of denizens of Leng. These cultists and musicians serve as high priests, laboring to appease the frightening gods who look down upon the Nightmare Realm with cold malice.
