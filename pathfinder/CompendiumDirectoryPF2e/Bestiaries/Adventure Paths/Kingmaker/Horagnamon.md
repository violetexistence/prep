    desc: "  Horagnamon can use simple items as tools, such as poking a stick at an opening to tease out a piece of food. He's also quite adept at stealing objects. He can't use Thievery to Palm an Object, Disable a Device, or Pick a Lock, but he can use Thievery to [[Actions/Steal|Steal]] light objects that he can carry in his beak or talons or to accomplish other relatively simple tasks."
