  - name: "No Time To Die"
    desc: "  As long as Armag wields _Ovinrbaane_ and is raging, the combination of the sword's magic and Armag's furious conviction that he is the true Armag protects him from death. His eyes and the sword's blade weep with blood and glow with red light at this time. As long as these conditions persist, he never increases beyond [[Conditions/Dying|Dying 3]] and is not rendered [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]]. Instead, Armag becomes [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]] and continues to fight. If _Ovinrbaane_ is taken from him (such as via a successful [[Actions/Disarm|Disarm]]), or if his rage ends while he is dying, he immediately dies regardless of his dying condition value. If he's healed to at least 1 Hit Point, the confusion effect immediately ends."

During his rage, Armag gains an additional reaction at the start of his turn, but he can only use this additional reaction for [[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Attack of Opportunity|Attacks of Opportunity]].

Male human warlord

Armag was not born with that name, but today, he fully believes he is the legendary ancient leader reborn to lead the Tiger Lords back to an age of glory. He has long forgotten his birth name, as well as much of his childhood, as his brief but overwhelming recent experiences forced these memories out of his mind to make room for bloodlust, an addiction to violence, and obsession with mayhem. Only his worship of Gorum remains today, yet even this has been corrupted-tainted by the fell influence of the Sisters of the Bloodshot Eye. Little remains in Armag's mind today save for a desire to conquer, to wield the mighty greatsword _Ovinrbaane_ in battle, and to revel in the glory of war. While he claims to be the reborn ancient hero, his "memories" of this previous life are largely hallucinations and fantasies implanted by the influence of his weapon.

Armag himself appears as a muscular human with unruly brown hair, a full beard, and an expression that seems incapable of any other visage than anger, wrath, or fury.
