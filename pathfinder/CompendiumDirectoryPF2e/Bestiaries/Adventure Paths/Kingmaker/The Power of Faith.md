    desc: "(3 actions; divine, enchantment, mental) Ghostly images of chanting dwarves float through the room, drifting between the creatures in the chamber. As they float, they use their 3 actions to target up to three different creatures in the room, touching their brows and filling that person's head with overwhelming but entirely mental choirs exalting the glory of Torag. The haunt targets [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] creatures before other creatures, and a single creature cannot be targeted more than once per round. A targeted creature must attempt a `DC 25 Will check` save; prone creatures take a -2 penalty on this saving throw.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature takes 1d10 mental damage from the cacophonous choir in their head.\n\n**Failure** The creature takes 2d10+9 mental damage from the cacophonous choir in their head.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature takes 3d10+18 mental damage from the cacophonous choir in their head and is knocked prone."
