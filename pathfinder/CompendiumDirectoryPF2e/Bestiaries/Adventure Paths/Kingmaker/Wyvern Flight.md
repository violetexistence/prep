    desc: "The Wyvern Flight ignores all ground- based difficult terrain and cannot become mired by effects that can be escaped by flight. When they use the [[Kingmaker Features/Disengage|Disengage]] action against armies that can't fly, their check result is improved one degree. Armies that lack the ability to fly suffer a â€“2 circumstance penalty on Advance actions against a Wyvern Flight."

  - name: "Wyvern Venom"
    desc: "An army that takes damage from a Wyvern Flight's melee strike increases its [[Kingmaker Features/Weary|Weary]] condition value by 1. If this would cause an army to increase its weary condition above 4, it instead takes 1 point of damage.\n\nEach time an army regains Hit Points during a battle, it can attempt a DC 11 Flat Check; on a success, it no longer suffers the ongoing effects of Wyvern Venom (but can still be affected by it later from a future attack, and does not reset its weary condition). The effects of Wyvern Venom also end as soon as an army escapes the battlefield or once the battle ends."

    desc: "`pf2:2` **Requirement** [[Kingmaker Features/Merciless|Merciless]]\n* * *\n\nYour army attacks with frightening vigor. Attempt a melee Strike against an enemy army's AC.\n\n**Critical Success** Your army inflicts 3 points of damage to the target army. If your army's next war action this turn is an attack war action against a different target army, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the Strike as your fury continues to the new target.\n\n**Success** Your army deals 2 points of damage to the target army.\n\n**Failure** Your army falters, but still deals 1 point of damage to the target army.\n\n**Critical Failure** Your army deals no damage to the target army and becomes [[Kingmaker Features/Outflanked|Outflanked]] until the start of its next turn."

  - name: "Counterattack"
    desc: "`pf2:r` **Requirement** [[Kingmaker Features/Flexible Tactics|Flexible Tactics]]\n\n**Trigger** An army you are engaged with attempts a maneuver war action.\n* * *\n\nYour army lashes out at the foe as they attempt to perform a maneuver. Attempt a melee Strike against the triggering army's AC. Counterattack doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike.\n\n**Critical Success** You inflict 1 point of damage on the army and increase its [[Kingmaker Features/Shaken|Shaken]] condition value by 1.\n\n**Success** You inflict 1 point of damage on the army."
