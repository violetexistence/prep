While you are raging:\n\n*   You deal 2 additional damage with melee weapons and unarmed attacks. This additional damage is halved if your weapon or unarmed attack is agile.\n*   You take a -1 penalty to AC.\n*   You can't use actions with the concentrate trait unless they also have the rage trait. You can [[Actions/Seek|Seek]] while raging.\n\nAfter you stop raging, you lose any remaining temporary Hit Points from Rage, and you can't Rage again for 1 minute."
