    desc: " (concentrate,divine,emotion,fear,mental,visual) 30 feet.

  - name: "Rejuvenation"
    desc: " (divine) If Davik is reduced to 0 Hit Points, his bones and gear melt into water that runs back into the river or seeps into the ground, leaving nothing behind. The next night, he rises again from his original location in the rubble located downstream from the ruined ferry crossing. When he does, he is completely healed of all damage, but now his unholy anger is directed at those who previously destroyed him as well as at the Stag Lord. He can use nightmare to threaten the one who destroyed him, promising to drag them to a drowning death unless the Stag Lord's remains are given to the river. [[Spells/Dispel Magic|Dispel Magic]] (DC 19 counteract check) can remove this sinister link between Davik and his destroyer, preventing Davik from using nightmare on that creature again until they return to this location. As long as the PCs don't abandon their goal of hunting the Stag Lord, Davik remains content and does not plague their dreams."

  - name: "Rotting Stench"
    desc: " (aura,olfactory) 10 feet. A creature entering the aura or starting their turn in the aura must succeed at a `DC 18 Fortitude check` save or become [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] (plus [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] on a critical failure for as long as it's sickened). While within the aura, creatures also take a -2 circumstance penalty to saves against fear and to recover from the sickened condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune for 1 minute and does not take the penalty to saves against fear effects.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Rotting Stench|Effect: Rotting Stench]]"

The target must immediately attempt a Will save against Davik's Fearsome Gaze. On a failed save, if the target is already [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened]], the value of its frightened condition is increased by 1 (or by 2 on a critical failure).

  - name: "Sure Possession"
    desc: "  As long as Davik Nettles continues to exist, his +1 ranseur cannot be taken from him. If disarmed of the +1 ranseur, if he drops it, or if it's destroyed, the ranseur melts into water; he can retrieve his +1 ranseur by pulling it out of any body of water as an Interact action. If Davik is put to rest permanently by fulfilling his quest, his +1 ranseur loses this ability and can be claimed by someone else."
