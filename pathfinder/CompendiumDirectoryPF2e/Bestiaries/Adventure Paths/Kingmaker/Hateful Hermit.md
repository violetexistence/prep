    desc: "`pf2:1` (emotion,mental) The hateful hermit unleashes a vexing stream of profanities and threats at a single foe he can see within 30 feet. The hermit gains a +1 circumstance bonus on all attack rolls made against that target until he chooses a different target to Focus Hatred on. The target must attempt a `DC 22 Will check` save, with the below effects. The hateful hermit cannot Focus Hatred again for 1d4 rounds.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected and is temporarily immune to Focus Hatred for 24 hours.\n\n**Success** The target is distracted by the hatred and is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] against the hermit's next attack.\n\n**Failure** The hermit's words unnerve the target and distract them; the target is off-guard until the end of the hateful hermit's next turn.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target is off-guard for 1 minute."
