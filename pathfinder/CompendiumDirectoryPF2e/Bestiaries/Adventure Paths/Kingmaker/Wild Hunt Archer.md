If they hit a creature with that Strike, the spell takes effect centered on that creature, and the creature struck takes a -2 circumstance penalty to any save against the spell's effect.

  - name: "Living Bow"
    desc: " (primal) The wild hunt archer carries a manifestation of their archery in the form of a living bow. This weapon functions as a _+2 greater striking frost composite longbow_ as long as it is wielded by the wild hunt archer, but in any other creature's hands the living bow functions as a normal, nonmagic composite longbow. A wild hunt archer can manifest a replacement living bow if its previous one is lost or destroyed by performing a one-minute activity that has the concentrate trait. A living bow appears to be made of wood and constantly sprouts leaves that turn autumnal colors and drop away; it's bowstring is a glowing green line of energy. A wild hunt archer spontaneously generates arrows as needed from its quiver when using a living bow."

These lithe, androgynous humanoids have pointed ears, glowing green eyes, and hair that flows softly at all times as if in a gentle breeze. They are methodical hunters who fire their bows with uncanny accuracy. Since wild hunt archers tend to be slower on foot than most of their companions, they often rely on wild hunt horses to provide increased mobility. Rather than carrying normal arrows, they can produce arrows as needed from magical quivers-these quivers do not function in this manner for anyone other than wild hunt archers.

Although some believe the wild hunt is nothing more than legend, the riders of the wild hunt are real. Countless members of these fey compose the wild hunt-the term "wild hunt" refers to the family of creatures as a whole as well as to individual groups of these fey who gather to pursue their quarry.

Wild hunt monarchs set the terms of each specific hunt, depending upon the prey and their own whims. The easier the prey, the more likely a monarch is to impose rules to make the hunt more entertaining, such as forbidding anyone but their hounds from injuring the quarry, or holding back their forces to give the target creature time to rest and recover.

While most missions come from rumors gathered by a wild hunt monarch, monarchs occasionally consider proposals from the few who are brave and knowledgeable enough to seek them out. They accept tasks only from sources they deem worthy, and the payments they demand for their services vary significantly, though they have no interest in material wealth. Wild hunt monarchs take grave offense at unfavorable deals. Those who attempt to cheat a monarch often become the enraged fey's next target.
