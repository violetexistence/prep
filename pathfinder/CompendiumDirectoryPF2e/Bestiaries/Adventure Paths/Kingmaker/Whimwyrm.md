Whimwyrms are unpredictable dragons native to the whimsically dangerous First World. While their coloration and appearance might evoke reactions of adoration, their moods shift quickly from one extreme to the other. Many who have assumed that their adorability and relatively small size equates to safety have met swift and grisly ends on a whimwyrm's fangs or magic.

A whimwyrm is a slender, sleek dragon, not much longer than seven feet from snout to tail, but its speed in combat is unnerving. When a whimwyrm attacks, be it with its fanged mouth or its long tail, it makes several quick, darting snaps or lashes at once. While stylistically, these attacks consist of multiple bites or lashings, they still resolve as a single Strike.
