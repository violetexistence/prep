    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate) Happs designates a single creature he can see as his target; when he does so, he issues a litany of mockery at the target. Happs gains a +2 circumstance bonus to Survival checks to [[Actions/Track|Track]] the target, and the first time he hits the target in a round, he deals an additional 1d8 precision damage to the target. These effects last until Happs uses Focused Target again."
