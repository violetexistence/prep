  - name: "Unseen Sight"
    desc: "  The ritual Foras led his cultists on allowed them to turn aside time and halt aging, but it required more than the sacrifice of an individual's given name-it required the sacrifice of sight itself. The removal of the eyes symbolized a Thresholder's abandonment of all they had seen before, and with the ritual's completion they gain something greater than mere vision: they gain the Unseen Sight. This is a precise sense that mimics [[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Darkvision|Darkvision]] yet functions even if the eye sockets themselves are covered. More importantly, the unseen sight allows a Thresholder to see the truth of the world, granting them the ability to see things as they actually are as if they were under the effects of [[Spells/Truesight|Truesight]], provided they are located within a region under the influence of Yog- Sothoth. Currently in the Stolen Lands, this is limited to the island of Candlemere and the dungeons within it; beyond this area, the Thresholder cultists are [[Conditions/Blinded|Blind]]. Of course, if their plan to draw Yog-Sothoth into the region succeeds, the region in which the unseen sight functions will increase dramatically."

Male human sorcerer

The man who would take the name Foras grew up millennia ago among worshipers of Pharasma, yet he came to believe that the Outer Gods were the keys to claiming personal power. He tricked his people's priests into to imparting eldritch truths they would not normally share, then shared them with a few fellow secretive scholars of the occult.

Gathering those whom Foras could manipulate, he retreated to a new stronghold-a location now known as Candlemere. Here, Foras's cult gave up their sight and their souls, only to become trapped with him within their own compound when their leader's brother tracked them down and imprisoned them. Yet even this hasn't stymied Foras, and he continues to this day to work toward his goal of drawing Yog-Sothoth into the world.
