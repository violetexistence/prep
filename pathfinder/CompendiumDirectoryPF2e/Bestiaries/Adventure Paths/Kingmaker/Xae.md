All living creatures in area **A3** must attempt a `DC 30 Will check` save. Xae cannot call upon Shyka's Judgment for 1d4 rounds.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature takes 6d6 mental damage.\n\n**Failure** The creature takes 12d6 mental damage and is [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] as their mind struggles with memories that seem to be from past lives that weigh the character's current actions in judgment.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature takes 18d6 mental damage and is [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]] by their mental struggle with their judgmental past lives. The creature also takes 2d6 persistent mental damage that ends if they leave area **A3**."

  - name: "Twist Time"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (primal) Xae attempts a ghostly hand strike. If she hits, she inflicts damage as normal, but the target struck must also attempt a `DC 30 Fortitude check` save (the target takes a -2 penalty to this saving throw if the strike was a critical hit).\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature is [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] for 1 round as the rest of reality seems to speed up.\n\n**Failure** The creature becomes decrepit from unnatural aging. It is [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 2]], and as long as it has the slowed condition, it is [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 2]] as well.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature feels death knocking on the door-it is [[Conditions/Doomed|Doomed 1]] as long as it remains slowed by Twist Time."
