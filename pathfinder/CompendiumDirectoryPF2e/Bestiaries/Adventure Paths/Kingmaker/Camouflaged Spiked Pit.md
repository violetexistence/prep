    desc: "`pf2:r` **Trigger** A creature walks onto one of the pits\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The triggering creature falls and rolls through several spikes as it slides to the bottom. This inflicts 5 bludgeoning damage from the fall itself down the steep slope (the falling PC can't attempt to [[Actions/Grab an Edge|Grab an Edge]] due to the lack of defined edges to the pit's walls), but the falling PC must also attempt a `DC 26 Reflex check` save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The character avoids all of the spikes and takes no additional damage.\n\n**Success** The character takes 2d10+11 piercing damage from the spikes.\n\n**Failure** The character takes 4d10+22 piercing damage from the spikes.\n\n**Critical Failure** The character takes 4d10+22 piercing damage from the spikes plus 2d6 bleed damage. While the character is taking this bleed damage, they are also [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]] from the pain."
