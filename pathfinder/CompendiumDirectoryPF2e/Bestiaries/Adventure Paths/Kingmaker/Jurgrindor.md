    desc: "  Jurgrindor's left arm is dreadfully wounded, courtesy of Amiri's greatsword. The discomfort of this wound causes Jurgrindor to take a -2 circumstance penalty to his Armor Class and Strikes (these modifications are included in his stats). At the end of each of his turns, Jurgrindor must succeed at a `DC 12 Flat check` or the wound begins to bleed again, dealing him 1d6 bleed damage. He can't use Catch Rock or Throw Rock (as typical giants) until he's healed back to full hit points."

    desc: "`pf2:1` (cold,primal) Jurgrindor breathes out a 15-foot cone of freezing moisture that quickly condenses into ice, dealing 2d6 cold damage (`DC 18 Reflex check`). A creature that critically fails the save is also [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] until it [[Actions/escape dc=18|escape dc=18]]{Escapes} (DC 18). Jurgrindor can't use Chill Breath for 1d4 rounds."
