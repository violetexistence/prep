  - name: "Hurl Nets"
    desc: "If the Tok-Nikrat Scouts hit an army with a net Strike, the army takes no damage. Instead, it increases its [[Kingmaker Features/Mired|Mired]] condition value by 1 (or by 2 on a critical success). An army that is mired as a result of hurled nets can attempt to reduce the value of this mired condition (but not that caused by other sources) by attempting a Battle action against the Tok-Nikrat Scout's Maneuver DC. On a success, the army reduces their mired condition by 1 (or by 2 on a critical success), but on a critical failure, they increase the mired condition caused by the hurled nets by 1. Tok-Nikrat Scouts can't hurl nets at a target army that is distant."
