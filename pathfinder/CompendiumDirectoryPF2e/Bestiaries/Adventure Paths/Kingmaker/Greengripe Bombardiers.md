    desc: "_**Note**: Basic siege armies know Engines of War automatically, and must 'spend' their first tactic on it._\n* * *\n\nSiege engines cannot be outfitted with gear. They cannot attack [[Kingmaker Features/Engaged|Engaged]] armies. They are more difficult to destroy due to their higher hit points than other basic armies. A siege engine can attack and damage fortifications with its ranged attacks as part of the [[Kingmaker Features/Battle|Battle]] or [[Kingmaker Features/Overwhelming Bombardment|Overwhelming Bombardment]] actions."

  - name: "Darkvision"
    desc: "The army includes several spotters and scouts who have darkvision, and the rest of the soldiers have been trained to follow their lead so that the army itself functions as if it had darkvision."

  - name: "Burning Weaponry"
    desc: "Unlike basic siege engine armies, Greengripe Bombardiers can make melee Strikes while engaged. When a Greengripe Bombardier scores a critical success on a Strike while taking the Battle action against an army (but not against a fortification), the army struck must make a successful Maneuver check against the Greengripe Bombardiers' Maneuver DC or take one additional point of damage from the goblins' burning weaponry."

  - name: "Explosive Defeat"
    desc: "When the Greengripe Bombardiers are defeated, their alchemical siege engine explodes. Any army engaged with the Greengripe Bombardiers must succeed at a Maneuver check against the Greengripe Bombardier's Maneuver DC or take 1 point of damage (2 points of damage on a critical failure). As long as the Greengripe Bombardiers aren't destroyed, their siege engine gear is rebuilt automatically once the army loses the defeated condition."
