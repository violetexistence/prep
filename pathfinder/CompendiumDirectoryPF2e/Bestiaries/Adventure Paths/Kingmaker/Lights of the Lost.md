    desc: "(3 actions) Up to four different creatures in area **A12** are each targeted by one of the floating, churning spheres of wine drifting through the air; it hurtles toward them and douses them with wine that turns to life- draining blood as it strikes unerringly. The haunt cannot target the same creature more than once each round. After the haunt is reduced to its broken threshold of 53 HP, it can target no more than two different creatures. A creature targeted by the lights of the lost must attempt a `DC 37 Fortitude check` save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature takes 4d6 void damage and is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] from drunkenness.\n\n**Failure** The creature takes 8d6 void damage and is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]].\n\n**Critical Failure** The takes 16d6 void damage, is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 3]], and becomes [[Conditions/Doomed|Doomed 1]]. As long as the creature is doomed from this trap, they cannot reduce their sickened condition below 1, and they take a -1 circumstance penalty on all further saving throws made against fear effects as lingering traces of the terror the priests felt loom in their memories."
