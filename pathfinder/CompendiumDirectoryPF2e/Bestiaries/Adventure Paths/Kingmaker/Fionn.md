  - name: "Bound to the Mortal Night"
    desc: "  Unlike most ghosts, Fionn isn't bound to a specific site. Instead, his exile to the Material Plane has bound him to the night itself. He can travel anywhere he wishes, so long as it is night. During the day, he cannot travel further than thirty feet from the location he occupies as the sun rises. He cannot leave the Material Plane at all, and if he suffers an effect that would normally transport him to another plane, he remains on the Material Plane and instead is [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 3]]."

  - name: "[[Creature Family Ability Glossary/(Ghost) Rejuvenation|Rejuvenation]]"
    desc: " (divine) In order to put Fionn permanently to rest, the PCs must release his brother Kean from Amiri's blade-doing so renders Fionn's plan to use Kean's soul to return to the First World impossible and causes the frustrated ghost to accept his fate and resign himself as well to the afterlife. Until this occurs, Fionn seeks out the blade each time he rejuvenates; now that he's seen the blade in person, he's capable of sensing its location at all times.\n* * *\n\nWhen a ghost is destroyed, it re-forms after 2d4 days within the location it's bound to, fully healed. A ghost can be permanently destroyed only if someone determines the reason for its existence and sets right whatever prevents the spirit from resting."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Void Healing|Void Healing]]"
    desc: "  A creature with void healing draws health from void energy rather than vitality energy. It is damaged by vitality damage and is not healed by vitality healing effects. It does not take void damage, and it is healed by void effects that heal undead."

  - name: "Command the Undead"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Frequency** once per round\n\n**Effect** Fionn's orders are difficult for undead to ignore. When Fionn Commands the Undead, two undead allies who are lower level than him and are within 30 feet of him may Stride or Strike."

  - name: "Exile's Curse"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (attack,curse,mental,misfortune,primal) Fionn casts [[Spells/Outcast's Curse|Outcast's Curse]], extending the spell's range to 30 feet. A creature that fails its save against the spell is also [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] ([[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] on a critical failure) by the overwhelming sensation and belief that they have been exiled from all they hold dear. This stupefaction value cannot be reduced below 1 as long as the creature continues to be affected by _outcast's curse_."

  - name: "Fearsome Blizzard"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (aura,cold,emotion,primal) Fionn exhales a swirling blizzard of snow and ice that chills the soul as surely as it freezes flesh. All living creatures within 60 feet of Fionn must attempt a `DC 33 Fortitude check` save. Fionn can't use Fearsome Blizzard for 1d4 rounds.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature takes 5d8 cold damage.\n\n**Failure** The creature takes 10d8 cold damage and is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]]; the frightened effect has the emotion, fear, and mental traits.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature takes 20d8 cold damage, is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]], and is [[Conditions/Fleeing|Fleeing]] as long as they remain frightened. The frightened and fleeing effects have the emotion, fear, and mental traits."
