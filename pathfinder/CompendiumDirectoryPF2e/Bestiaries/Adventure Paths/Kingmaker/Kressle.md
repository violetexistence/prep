    desc: "  Kressle has a violent knack for striking grievous wounds to her opponent's hands. If she scores a critical hit on a target with a hatchet Strike, the target must succeed at a `DC 17 Fortitude check` save or become [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] (or [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 2]] on a critical failure). This condition persists until the target receives any amount of healing."
