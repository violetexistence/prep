  - name: "Unseen Sight"
    desc: "  The removal of the eyes symbolized a Thresholder's abandonment of all they had seen before, and with the ritual's completion they gain something greater than mere vision: they gain the Unseen Sight. This is a precise sense that mimics darkvision yet functions even if the eye sockets themselves are covered. More importantly, the unseen sight allows a Thresholder to see the truth of the world, granting them the ability to see things as they actually are as if they were under the effects of [[Spells/Truesight|Truesight]], provided they are located within a region under the influence of Yog- Sothoth."

These deal 1d12 slashing damage; are in the brawling group; and have the parry, forceful, and unarmed traits. While in this stance, if the disciple succeeds or critically succeeds at a check to [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] a target, the target must succeed at a `DC 34 Will check` saving throw or be [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] ([[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 3]] on a critical failure) for 1 minute."

These effects last until the end of the disciple's next turn."

  - name: "Temporal Strikes"
    desc: "  The disciple's Strikes force the creature hit to endure a deluge of unfamiliar memories from a combination of past lives and parallel existences, causing an additional 3d6 mental damage with a successful hit."
