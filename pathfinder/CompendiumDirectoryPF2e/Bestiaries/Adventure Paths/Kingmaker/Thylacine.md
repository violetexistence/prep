A thylacine can be easily mistaken for a dog or jackal, but the defining stripes on their gold-hued backs and unusually wide gaping jaws negate this perception in close encounters. A thylacine is quite vocal, and uses a combination of growls, hisses, and gaping threat-yawns when threatened. An adult thylacine stands 2 feet tall at the shoulder, is 4 feet long (not counting an additional 2 feet of tail) and weighs roughly 50 pounds.

The thylacine is a marsupial carnivore. This nocturnal predator typically hunts alone, only occasionally forming small packs. Because of their odd appearance, thylacines have a far harsher reputation than they probably should, playing a sort of bogeyman role in farming communities.
