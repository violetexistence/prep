    desc: "`pf2:2`  The chromatic ooze concentrates its mass into several pseudopods, increasing its reach to 30 feet until the end of its turn.

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead spend an action to use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

Chromatic oozes result from the worst kind of alchemical mishaps: attempts to combine as many types of elemental damage as possible into a single alchemical substance. Although the source of these alchemical concatenations are as varied as the alchemists who attempt to distill them, one of the most common methods for creating them involves combining the essences of multiple types of chromatic dragons together using eldritch alchemical processes. When this type of experimentation goes dangerously wrong-as it often does-the result is a combination of terrible elemental power with the mindless destructive power of an ooze. A chromatic ooze is a rippling, seething substance that shifts through several different colors, but chemical reactions within the ooze can lock its energy and its color into a specific phase for a short time. Whether a chromatic ooze's destructive urges derive from the frustrated ingenuity of an alchemist creator or from the hunger of the chromatic dragons that so often constitute these oozes' forms, the best way to deal with a chromatic ooze is to stay out of its way.
