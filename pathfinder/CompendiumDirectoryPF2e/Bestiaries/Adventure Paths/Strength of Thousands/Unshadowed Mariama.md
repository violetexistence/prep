  - name: "Shadow's Displeasure"
    desc: "  When Mariama has fewer than 150 Hit Points, her shadow pulls at her essence to show the _Vesicant Egg's_ displeasure. She looks pained and confused. When below 50 Hit Points, she falls [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]]."

  - name: "Vesicated Shadow"
    desc: "  Mariama's shadow has become corrupted via the power of the _Vesicant Egg_. Her shredded shadow grants her some control over acid and shadows. She gains a +4 status bonus to resist acid and shadow effects."

  - name: "Weird Astrology"
    desc: "  Perhaps because of Mariama's quirky nature, she has received all the effects of the astrological evaluator. When she gains any of the clumsy, drained, enfeebled, or stupefied conditions, she reduces the value by 1. This means her Shadow's Displeasure doesn't affect her until she has fewer than 50 Hit Points, when she falls [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]]."

  - name: "Bind Destinies"
    desc: "`pf2:3` (curse,occult) **Frequency** once per day\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Mariama ties her fate with that of another creature within 30 feet. The creature must attempt a `DC 40 Will check` save. Regardless of the result of its save, the creature is temporarily immune for 1 day.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The two fates are bound. Whenever Mariama takes damage, the creature takes damage of the same type equal to half the damage Mariama took (`DC 37 Fortitude check`). Immunities, resistances, and weaknesses still apply as normal. The creature can attempt to sever the bond by spending an action, which has the concentrate trait, to attempt another `DC 40 Will check` save. On a success, the bond is severed, and the effect ends. The bond also ends when Mariama falls [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]], or if she actively ends the effect herself as a free action.\n\n**Failure** As success, but the creature takes damage equal to the full amount Mariama took. Severing the bond requires a 2-action activity, which has the concentrate trait.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but `DC 40 Fortitude check`. Severing the bond requires a 3-action activity, which has the concentrate trait."

  - name: "Rupture Shadow"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (acid,occult,shadow) Mariama can create immense blisters on a creature's shadow, which immediately burst, dealing 20d6 acid damage. She targets a creature within 60 feet that is casting a shadow, which must attempt a `DC 37 Will check` save. Mariama can't use Rupture Shadow again for 1d4 rounds.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected and becomes temporarily immune for 1 day.\n\n**Success** The target takes half damage. The bursting shadow deals 5 acid splash damage to all creatures within 5 feet of the target.\n\n**Failure** The target takes full damage, and the bursting shadow deals 10 acid splash damage.\n\n**Critical Failure** The target takes double damage, the bursting shadow deals 20 acid splash damage, and the target also takes 4d6 persistent acid damage."
