    desc: "`pf2:1` (attack) Medium, 2d8+7 bludgeoning, Rupture 20\n* * *\n\nThe monster attempts to swallow a creature of the listed size or smaller that it has grabbed or restrained in its jaws or mouth. If a swallowed creature is of the maximum size listed, the monster can't use Swallow Whole again. If the creature is smaller than the maximum, the monster can usually swallow more creatures; the GM determines the maximum. The monster attempts an `Athletics check` check opposed by the grabbed creature's Reflex DC. If it succeeds, it swallows the creature. The monster's mouth or jaws no longer grab a creature it has swallowed, so the monster is free to use them to Strike or Grab once again. The monster can't attack creatures it has swallowed.\n\nA swallowed creature is [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]], is [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]], and has to hold its breath or start suffocating. The swallowed creature takes the listed amount of damage when first swallowed and at the end of each of its turns while it's swallowed. If the victim [[Actions/Escape|Escapes]] this ability's grabbed condition, it exits through the monster's mouth. This frees any other creature grabbed in the monster's mouth or jaws. A swallowed creature can attack the monster that has swallowed it, but only with unarmed attacks or with weapons of light Bulk or less. The swallowing creature is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] against the attack. If the monster takes piercing or slashing damage equaling or exceeding the listed Rupture value from a single attack or spell, the swallowed creature cuts itself free. A creature that gets free by either Escaping or cutting itself free can immediately breathe and exits the swallowing monster's space.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Engulf and Swallow Whole|Effect: Engulf and Swallow Whole]]\n\nIf the monster dies, a swallowed creature can be freed by creatures adjacent to the corpse if they spend a combined total of 3 actions cutting the monster open with a weapon or unarmed attack that deals piercing or slashing damage."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Grab|Grab]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** The monster's last action was a successful Strike that lists Grab in its damage entry, or the monster has a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]\n* * *\n\n**Effect** If used after a Strike, the monster attempts to [[Actions/grapple|grapple]] the creature using the body part it attacked with. This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

creatures:
  - 1: Gbahali
```



Resembling an enormous, long-legged alligator, the gbahali is larger, stronger, faster, and more cunning than all but the largest of its crocodilian kin. Gbahalis will range far from the banks of the rivers they inhabit to seek prey. With a powerful, squat snout, a gbahali viciously bites their quarry, while their powerful hind legs allow them to leap upon fleeing creatures or stride away to safety when threatened.

Gbahalis are solitary creatures, splitting their time between the rivers that offer easy meals of fish and aquatic snakes and stalking the edges of the hunting territories of larger, meatier prey. Given the option, gbahalis much prefer warm-blooded food, but a hungry or injured gbahali remains near a river where it can more easily consume large fish, snakes, or even crocodiles until it's ready to hunt its preferred quarry once again. An adult gbahali can quickly take down and consume livestock, leaving no sign of its meals but enormous scuffed tracks in the ground, as its jaws are large enough to swallow many creatures whole.

Gbahalis have a basic understanding of humanoid behavior. A gbahali learns quickly to evade trackers and traps, and can skillfully hunt along the fringes of a settlement for months before its presence becomes known. They usually avoid humanoid prey, even when hungry; they know that humanoid communities may hunt them in dogged retaliation for feasting upon a humanoid. Gbahalis therefore prefer to hunt far-ranging livestock like ranch or grazing animals. If another predator threatens a gbahali's territory, it might attack a humanoid, leave messy remains strewn about, and then retreat from the area for several weeks. In this time, it hopes the angry humanoids will hunt and kill its rival, leaving the gbahali an uncontested hunting ground when it returns.
