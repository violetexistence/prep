    desc: "  Tremorsense allows a monster to feel the vibrations through a solid surface caused by movement. It is an imprecise sense with a limited range (listed in the ability). Tremorsense functions only if the monster is on the same surface as the subject, and only if the subject is moving along (or burrowing through) the surface."

    desc: " (aura,primal) 20 feet. The hivebound arboreal is host to a cloud of flying ants that swarm around it and gnaw at any creature within the aura. Non-arboreal creatures that enter the aura or start their turn within it take 7d8 piercing damage from the bites (`DC 38 Fortitude check`). If the hivebound arboreal fails a saving throw against an area effect, the biting ants die off, and the aura is deactivated until new ants swarm out at the end of the hivebound arboreal's next turn (or after 1 minute, if the hivebound arboreal critically fails it saving throw)."

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead spend an action to use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."
