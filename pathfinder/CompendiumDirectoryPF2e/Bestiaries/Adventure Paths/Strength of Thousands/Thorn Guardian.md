    desc: "`pf2:r`  **Trigger** A creature within the monster's reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The monster attempts a melee Strike against the triggering creature.

This doesn't interfere with its ward's senses or actions. The thorn guardian occupies the same space as its ward and moves with its ward.\n\nWhile worn, the thorn guardian establishes a constant [[Spells/Share Life|Share Life]] effect with its ward. Attacks that target the thorn guardian target the ward instead but use the higher AC or saving throw values between the thorn guardian and the ward. Area effects apply to both the thorn guardian and the ward, as normal for an area effect."
