    desc: " (divine,fire) When the sun hunter is destroyed, they explode in a blast of flame that deals 6d6 fire damage in a 10-foot emanation (`DC 27 Reflex check` save). Creatures that critically fail their saves are marked with Walkena's religious symbol on a visible area of their body, which remains for 1 day. This mark allows Walkena to treat the creature as if he knew the creature's identity but not having met them for the purposes of [[Spells/Scrying|Scrying]], lowering the spell's DC by 2. The sun hunter's gear and treasure are unaffected by the explosion and left in a pile where they die."
