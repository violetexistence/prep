    desc: "  When Haibam has fewer than 150 Hit Points, his shadow pulls at his essence to show the _Vesicant Egg's_ displeasure.

  - name: "Rupture Shadow"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (acid,occult,shadow) Haibam can create immense blisters on a creature's shadow, which immediately burst, dealing 20d6 acid damage. He targets a creature within 60 feet that is casting a shadow, which must attempt a `DC 37 Will check` save. Haibam can't use Rupture Shadow again for 1d4 rounds.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected and becomes temporarily immune for 1 day.\n\n**Success** The target takes half damage. The bursting shadow deals 5 acid splash damage to all creatures within 5 feet of the target.\n\n**Failure** The target takes full damage, and the bursting shadow deals 10 acid splash damage.\n\n**Critical Failure** The target takes double damage, the bursting shadow deals 20 acid splash damage, and the target also takes 4d6 persistent acid damage."

  - name: "Wind Step"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (air,arcane) Haibram draws air around him to aid his movement. He Strides up to his Speed, gaining the effects of [[Spells/Air Walk|Air Walk]] and ignoring difficult terrain while moving. He can increase the number of actions to 3 to Stride up to three times his Speed instead. Haibram begins to fall immediately after using Wind Step but treats the fall as 60 feet shorter thanks to the supporting winds."

  - name: "Wind Touch"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  Haibram imbues a weapon he's holding with the power of the wind until the start of his next turn. The wind's power allows Haibram to swing and hurl the weapon with great force, causing the weapon to deal an additional 2d10 damage. If the weapon does not have the thrown trait, it also gains the thrown 10 feet trait during this attack."
