Gremlins arose long ago in the First World, living embodiments of nature's ability to wear away, erode, and decompose. On the Material Plane, their encounters with mortal civilizations twisted them into creatures devoted to chaos, sabotage, and traps, each variety specializing in a particular brand of mayhem.

* * *

Even more than most gremlins, grimples resent the trappings of civilization: inn common rooms with their rowdy singalongs, livery yards with their whinnying horses, church steeples with their clanging bells. Grimples live to spoil these conventions, dropping tavern signs on patrons, urinating in rain barrels, and opening stable doors. When all else fails, they literally vomit their disdain on passersby.

Grimples resemble humanoid, mange-ridden opossums, with boar-like tusks that aid them in rooting through garbage heaps for food. They are agile climbers who glide from eave to eave on the loose flaps of skin between their limbs. Savvy gremlin-hunters know to look for the skin flakes and fur grimples shed from their parasite-infested hides.
