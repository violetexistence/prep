Magic can be used for many purposes-creating objects, summoning creatures, and manipulating the elements. Usually when a ritual is cast, the outcome is reliable and predictable, but sometimes magic takes unexpected turns and a spell's energy lands in unintended places.

Spellskeins are scraps of fabric and paper infused with magic and brought to life. Once animated, they fold themselves into different shapes, changing both their appearance and their abilities based on their configuration. Spellskeins are only rarely aggressive and sometimes downright timid, but most have a playful streak.

Though they are often made accidentally out of magical leakage from rituals, some ritualists intentionally create spellskeins to serve as magical toys or animated decor. These planned spellskeins tend to be more obedient and less mischievous than their accidental counterparts, following commands or routines set by their creators even after said creators are long gone.

Scrap pieces torn from the body of a spellskein sometimes animate as ever smaller, more mischievous constructs, which usually dart away to hide until it's safe to come out and cause trouble.
