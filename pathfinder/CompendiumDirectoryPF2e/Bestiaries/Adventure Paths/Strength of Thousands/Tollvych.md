    desc: " (divine) If the heroes destroy Dwandek (even if only temporarily, before destroying his _soul cage_ as well), the cathedral's hold over Tollvych's soul loosens; the next time the heroes enter this room (or 24 hours later), his ghost rises one last time from his remains with a sigh, and then moves into the afterlife.\n* * *\n\nWhen a ghost is destroyed, it re-forms after 2d4 days within the location it's bound to, fully healed.
