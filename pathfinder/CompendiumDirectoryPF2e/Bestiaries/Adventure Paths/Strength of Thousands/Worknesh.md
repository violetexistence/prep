  - name: "Walkena's Judgment"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,divine) Worknesh designates a single creature as an enemy of Walkena. She must be able to see or hear the creature, or she must be tracking the creature. Worknesh gains a +4 status bonus to damage against the designated creature, and she gains fast healing 5 while within 30 feet of the creature. In addition, she doesn't take the -2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls when attempting to deal nonlethal damage with an attack without the nonlethal trait and vice versa. Worknesh can have only one creature designated as an enemy of Walkena at a time. If she uses Walkena's Judgment against a creature when she already has a creature designated, the prior creature loses the designation and the new target gains the designation. This designation lasts for 24 hours."
