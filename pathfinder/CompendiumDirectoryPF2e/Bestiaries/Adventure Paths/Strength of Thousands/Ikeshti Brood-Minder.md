Ikeshti young are near-mindless carnivores. They are watched over by brood-minders, male ikeshtis with a talent for influencing the ravenous spawn, who protect the tiny creatures until they grow into responsible adults.

Ikeshtis are reptilian humanoids native to Akiton's wastelands. Smaller than Golarion's iruxi, ikeshtis organize around distinct societal roles.
