The creature takes a -20-foot penalty to its Speeds for 1 minute. As normal, this penalty can't reduce a creature's Speed below 5 feet. Any creatures [[Conditions/Fascinated|Fascinated]] by the alapolo due to its Enticing Invitation are freed from their fascination when the alapolo uses this ability, jarred by the graceless stomping."

Short-lived, strange creatures called alapolos cling to the shadows in eerie moonlight, inviting others to dance. Although these "shadow dancers" aren't actively malevolent, they become petulant when others won't dance with them.
