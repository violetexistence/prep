    desc: "`DC 26 Thievery check` (expert), `DC 28 Arcana check` (expert), or `DC 28 Occultism check` (expert) to harmlessly bleed away the electrical energy from the rune. Once the trap has been activated, the electrical energy is stronger, so three successful checks (of any combination of the relevant skills) are necessary to deactivate it, but these checks can be attempted from anywhere in the room."

    desc: "(1 action) The trap deals 4d10 electricity damage (`DC 26 Reflex check` save) to all creatures in the room. A creature that fails the save is [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] ([[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 2]] on a critical failure). A creature that isn't touching the water treats the result of its saving throw as one degree of success better."
