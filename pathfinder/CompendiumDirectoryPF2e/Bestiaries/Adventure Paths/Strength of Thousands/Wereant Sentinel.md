  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Change Shape|Change Shape]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,polymorph,primal) The wereant changes into their humanoid, hybrid, or animal shape. Each shape has a specific, persistent appearance. A true wereant's natural form is their hybrid shape. In humanoid shape, they use their original humanoid size, lose their jaws and claw Strikes, and gain a melee fist Strike that deals bludgeoning damage equal to the slashing damage dealt by their mandibles. In animal shape, they take the form of a Medium giant ant, gain a climb Speed of 20 feet, gain Grab on their mandibles Strike, and lose their weapon Strikes.\n* * *\n\nThe monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

    desc: " (polymorph,primal) When a full moon appears in the night sky, the wereant must enter hybrid form, can't Change Shape thereafter, becomes one size larger, increases its reach by 5 feet, and increases the damage of their mandibles Strike by 2.\n\nWhen the moon sets or the sun rises, the werecreature returns to humanoid form and is [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]] for 2d4 hours.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Moon Frenzy|Effect: Moon Frenzy]]"

  - name: "Sentinel's Focus"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  The wereant sentinel plants its feet in defiance of those who would move it. It gains a +2 circumstance bonus to defenses against being Shoved or Tripped, and its melee Strikes deal an additional 2d8 mental damage. These effects end when it moves from its square using anything other than Hasty Reposition."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Knockdown|Knockdown]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** The monster's last action was a successful Strike that lists Knockdown in its damage entry\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The monster attempts to [[Actions/trip|trip]] the creature. This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the monster's multiple attack penalty."
