Unlike with a normal grab, the creature isn't [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]], but it can't move beyond the reach of Grouloop's tongue.\n\nA creature can sever the tongue by hitting AC 24 and dealing at least 9 slashing damage. Though this doesn't deal any damage to the boggard, it prevents her from using her tongue Strike until she regrows her tongue, which takes a week."
