    desc: " (arcane) The graveknight's curse extends to their shield, or the graveknight's armor uses a portion of itself to produce a shield.\n\nThe graveknight has a shield that uses the statistics of a _[[Equipment/Sturdy Shield (Minor)|Sturdy Shield (Minor)]]_.\n\nThe shield is quasi-independent of the graveknight and automatically protects the graveknight from harm. When the shield is raised, it automatically uses Shield Block to reduce the damage of the first attack against the graveknight each round without the graveknight needing to spend their reaction to do so.\n\nThe shield automatically rejuvenates with the rest of the graveknight and must be destroyed in the same manner as the graveknight's armor."

    desc: " (divine) When a graveknight is destroyed, its armor rebuilds its body over the course of 1d10 days-or more quickly if the armor is worn by a living host. If the body is destroyed before then, the process restarts.\n\nA graveknight can only be permanently destroyed by obliterating its armor (such as with [[Spells/Disintegrate|Disintegrate]]), transporting it to the Forge of Creation, or throwing it into the heart of a volcano."
