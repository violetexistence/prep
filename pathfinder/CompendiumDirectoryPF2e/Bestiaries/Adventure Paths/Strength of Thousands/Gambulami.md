    desc: "`pf2:2`  **Requirements** Gambulami is larger than Small in size and has a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] with his jaws\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Gambulami whips the creature around, smashing it against other nearby creatures. He makes an `Athletics check` check against the grabbed creature's Fortitude DC. Regardless of the result, the creature is released from Gambulami's jaws afterward, escaping into the space in which it was grabbed.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** Gambulami uses a mighty spin to smash the held creature against every creature within his reach. Every creature, including the grabbed creature, takes 1d10+7 bludgeoning damage.\n\n**Success** As critical success, but creatures take 1d10 bludgeoning damage.\n\n**Failure** The creature breaks free.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature breaks free and Gambulami's spin causes him to fall [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]."

    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** The monster's last action was a successful Strike that lists Grab in its damage entry, or the monster has a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]\n* * *\n\n**Effect** If used after a Strike, the monster attempts to [[Actions/grapple|grapple]] the creature using the body part it attacked with. This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."
