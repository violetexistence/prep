    desc: "(2 actions) The hazard uses its first action to spread 10 feet down the hallway in both directions. Once out of the hall, each side spreads in a random direction each round, but they don't go through doors. The hazard uses its second action to move the center of the [[Spells/Toxic Cloud|Toxic Cloud]] up to 20 feet in any direction to which any part of the pool has line of effect (normally, to encompass the greatest number of characters). If the _cloudkill_ isn't present, it instead uses its second action to produce a new _cloudkill_, as Poison Puff."

    desc: "The hazard ends after 1 minute, contracting to its original size and keeping still until disturbed again."
