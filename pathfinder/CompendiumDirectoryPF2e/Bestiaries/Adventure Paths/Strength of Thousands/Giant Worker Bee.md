Worker bees, exclusively female, exist to feed and defend a hive. They have no qualms about sacrificing their lives when confronting intruders in their territory. Worker bees can fight singly, in small groups, or in swarms of dozens. Giant worker bees inject a venom with their stings, but this venom is rarely dangerous except to people sensitive to it. Other worker bees have no stinger and only bite their enemies.

Like their smaller counterparts, giant bees are highly territorial. Many types of giant bees construct hives in caves or abandoned buildings and are quick to attack creatures that they deem a threat to the single fertile queen, who almost never leaves the hive. Although most common in warm biomes with lots of vegetation, some giant bees live in arid or cold environments and are solitary rather than hive-dwelling.
