    desc: "  A creature hit by the riding frog's tongue becomes [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] by the riding frog. The creature isn't [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]], but it can't move beyond the reach of the frog's tongue. A creature can sever the tongue with a Strike against AC 13 that deals at least 2 slashing damage.\n\nThis deals no damage to the frog but prevents it from using its tongue Strike until it regrows its tongue, which takes a week."

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."
