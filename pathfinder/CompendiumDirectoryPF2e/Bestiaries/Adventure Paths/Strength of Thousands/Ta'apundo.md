    desc: "`pf2:r` (primal) **Trigger** a non-cold iron metal object damages the ta'apundo\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The ta'apundo emits a jolt of magic into the object, transforming it into wood with an unlimited duration. A thrown weapon, ammunition, or other unattended item automatically transforms; the wielder of an attended object can resist this effect with a successful `DC 41 Fortitude check` save. [[Spells/Dispel Magic|Dispel Magic]] can end the effect. While a weapon is wood, the ta'apundo's resistance applies. Once transformed, a formerly metal item's Hardness and HP change to those of wood. This typically inflicts a -2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls made with metal weapons and a -2 circumstance penalty to AC for those wearing metal armor; the GM might determine a different penalty for a specific weapon or armor."

The First World still holds the first rough draft of many creatures in the Material Plane, but it's hard to tell what sort of creature the ta'apundo was ever intended to be. Its bark poses significant danger to metallic objects, as it converts any metal touching it into wood as fibrous and as flexible as its own body. Capricious and skittish, ta'apundos make friends easily but consider anyone who wields or wears metal to be a hated enemy.
