    desc: "(3 actions) With each action, the auto‑turret makes a longrifle Strike against a creature within 60 feet of Tan‑Takneh's campsite (other than Tan-Takneh). If there are no such creatures, the auto‑turret instead uses its action to sprout mechanical legs, totter 20 feet in the direction of its last target, and then plant itself into the ground again. Programmed to spread its fire around, the auto‑turret doesn't attack any creature it's already attacked in the round.\n\nAfter making 15 Strikes, the auto‑turret depletes its ammunition and automatically deactivates."
