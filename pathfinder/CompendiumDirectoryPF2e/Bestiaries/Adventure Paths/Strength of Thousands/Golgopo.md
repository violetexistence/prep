As their empire crumbled and fell into ruin, many cyclopes turned to increasingly depraved and vicious rituals to enhance their divinations and oracular powers. Some, especially those too fearful or suspicious of their fellow cyclopes to collaborate, constructed servants known as golgopos to aid in their rituals. These squat creatures are made from ancient bones dredged from fetid swamps and packed with mud to resemble a squat humanoid. Their heads are little more than the skull of whatever creature's bones were used in their creation with an extra eye socket punched in the forehead, glowing with eerie light.

Golgopos spend most of their time perched on the shoulder of a cyclops master, acting as secondary casters for foul rituals and casting spells to aid them as needed. Golgopos are generally not evil, however, and one whose master has abandoned them or been destroyed might be convinced to employ their knowledge of ritual magic in service of another.
