    desc: "`pf2:r`  **Trigger** A creature within the monster's reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The monster attempts a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, the monster disrupts that action. This Strike doesn't count toward the monster's multiple attack penalty, and its multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike."

    desc: "`pf2:r` (arcane) **Trigger** A creature attempts to move away from the graveknight\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The graveknight's armor animates and attempts to Grab the triggering creature. It makes an Athletics check to [[Actions/Grapple|Grapple]] using the graveknight's Athletics modifier - 2. The armor can continue to Grapple the creature normally.\n\nSince the armor is grappling the creature, the graveknight doesn't need a free hand to do so."

    desc: " (divine) When a graveknight is destroyed, its armor rebuilds its body over the course of 1d10 days-or more quickly if the armor is worn by a living host. If the body is destroyed before then, the process restarts.\n\nA graveknight can only be permanently destroyed by obliterating its armor (such as with [[Spells/Disintegrate|Disintegrate]]), transporting it to the Forge of Creation, or throwing it into the heart of a volcano."

    desc: "  A creature with void healing draws health from void energy rather than vitality energy. It is damaged by vitality damage and is not healed by vitality healing effects. It does not take void damage, and it is healed by void effects that heal undead."

  - name: "[[Creature Family Ability Glossary/(Graveknight) Channel Magic|Channel Magic]]"
    desc: "`pf2:2`  The graveknight redirects magical energies through its armor, allowing it to deliver magic through an attack.\n\nThe graveknight Casts a Spell that takes 1 or 2 actions to cast and requires a spell attack roll. The effects of the spell don't occur immediately but are imbued into an attack instead. The graveknight then makes a melee Strike with a weapon or unarmed attack. The spell is coupled with the attack, using the attack roll result to determine the effects of both the Strike and the spell.\n\nThis counts as two attacks for the graveknight's multiple attack penalty but doesn't apply the penalty until after it's completed Channeling Magic.\n\nThe graveknight can't use Channel Magic again for 1d4 rounds."
