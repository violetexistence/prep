    desc: " (divine,fire) When the sun warrior is destroyed, they explode in a blast of flame that deals 6d6 fire damage in a 10-foot emanation (`DC 27 Reflex check` save). Creatures that critically fail their saves are marked with Walkena's religious symbol on a visible area of their body, which remains for 1 day. This mark allows Walkena to treat the creature as if he knew the creature's identity but not having met them for the purposes of [[Spells/Scrying|Scrying]], lowering the spell's DC by 2. The sun warrior's gear and treasure are unaffected by the explosion and left in a pile where they die."

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."
