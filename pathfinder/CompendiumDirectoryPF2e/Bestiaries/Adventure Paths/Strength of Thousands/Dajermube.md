Female elite nemhaith

This undead guardian stands amid a whirling swarm of shackled spirits that rage against their fate. Bound by a profane necromantic ritual, a nemhaith and its servitors maintain watch over an object or place so important they embraced undeath to guard it. This ritual binds connected beings-friends, family, fellow worshippers, or even sacrificed innocents-to form a single nemhaith.

Most nemhaiths were, in life, priests or protectors who sought immortality to protect the temple they served or guard an important landmark. Others follow an endless and even impossible quest beyond the bounds of life and death. A nemhaith is not always evil at first, but the inherent evil and violence of a nemhaith's existence inevitably darkens even the brightest light.
