In rough Akitonian cities like Seldo, shobhad bruisers and fist-fighters act as protection for businesses and enforcers for crime bosses. Shobhad enforcers are more rare and far more dangerous. In the wilds of Akiton, shobhad enforcers protect wealthy caravans using combat techniques honed and proven over multiple generations to devastate any creature that might mistake the caravan as an attractive target for a raid. "Enforcer" is a loose translation of a word in the Shobhad language that is only granted to a warrior who has proven themselves in combat against one of the deadly threats of the Akitonian desert, such as gluttonworms or ikeshti riveners. Every enforcer is a battle-tested veteran with the scars to prove their prowess.

These four-armed humanoids often live as nomads on Akiton. Self-sufficient and able to construct the equipment they need to survive from natural materials, shobhads traditionally avoid large cities and the smaller people of the planet, except to engage in trade. Some shobhads eschew these traditions, finding life in urban centers to be more appealing. Rifts between these shobhads and those who continue to lead nomadic lives in the Akitonian wilderness sometimes lead to clashes when members of the two societies meet.

Shobhads are highly sought after for their martial expertise, unparalleled knowledge of Akiton's wilds, and unbreakable codes of honor. These warriors may operate independently, in their traditional clans, or in modern mercenary companies that blend ancestral traditions with the needs of modern military freelancers.
