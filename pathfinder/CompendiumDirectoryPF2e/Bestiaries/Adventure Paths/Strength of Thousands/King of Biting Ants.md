    desc: "  Tremorsense allows a monster to feel the vibrations through a solid surface caused by movement. It is an imprecise sense with a limited range (listed in the ability). Tremorsense functions only if the monster is on the same surface as the subject, and only if the subject is moving along (or burrowing through) the surface."

    desc: "  This monster doesn't have a single mind (typically because it's a swarm of smaller creatures), and is immune to mental effects that target only a specific number of creatures. It is still subject to mental effects that affect all creatures in an area."

The King of Biting Ants loses his spell slot as if he had cast the triggering spell. He then attempts to counteract the triggering spell."

    desc: "  When the King of Biting Ants is reduced to 0 HP, he discorporates, and the component ants that make up his body disperse in every direction. If even a single ant escapes, the King of Biting Ants will eventually re-form using a process that typically takes 1d10 days.\n\nApplying area damage immediately after the King of Biting Ants is killed prevents his return."
