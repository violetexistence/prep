Baneback gripplis with innate magical ability may find themselves drawn to vile magic dealing with poison, vermin, and ill luck. Those who revel in the dreadful legends surrounding their kind often worship evil gods or demons associated with poison, tattooing themselves with mystic symbols to gain powerful control over toxins.

* * *

Gripplis are small, frog-like humanoids native to tropical rainforests. Most gripplis live in tight-knit treetop villages and survive primarily as hunters and gatherers. While most communities are peaceful and harmonious, a lingering superstition has led to a unique group of these people being cut off from their communal bonds and forced to make their own way in the world.

Among the many gripplis who possess poison glands, a rare subset secrete mind-altering chemicals. These gripplis aren't immune to this toxin, and over many years it may render them erratic at best and selfishly misanthropic at worst. Other gripplis view these "banebacks" as cursed and react to their presence with fear and mistrust, which usually leads to their censure and exile. They soon find that their natural skills as hunters, combined with an unlimited supply of their potent toxin, make them ideally suited to taking on work as mercenaries, bandits, or assassins.
