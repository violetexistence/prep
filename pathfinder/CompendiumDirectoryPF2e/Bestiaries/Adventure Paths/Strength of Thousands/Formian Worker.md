By far the most common formian on Akiton, workers are focused and industrious, naturally skilled at manual labor and coordinating with peers.

Formians resemble unusually large ants with an insectile humanoid's upper torso. More powerful or influential formians are physically larger; common formian workers are roughly the height of a gnome, while the largest formians, such as taskmasters and queens, rival a giant in size.

Formian society is a strict matriarchy. Though each hive's queen is theoretically independent and her rule absolute, allegiances are common, and less powerful hives often (grudgingly) defer to more powerful matriarchs.
