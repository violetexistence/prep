All creatures within the area of effect must succeed at a `DC 40 Will check` save or be unable to take hostile actions for 1 round.\n\nAfter using this ability, the contemplative is [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]], or increases its drained value by 1 if it was already drained.

The target must be within 60 feet, and once targeted must attempt a `DC 40 Will check` save, becoming [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] on a failure or [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 2]] on a critical failure.\n\nEach time an affected creature ends its turn, its slowed value decreases by 1. A creature that critically succeeds on their save against Temporal Suppression is temporarily immune to it for 24 hours."

As they near the next phase of their journey through existence, contemplative mentors split their time between unlocking the highest secrets of time and space, and guiding their students and less-talented peers.

The ancestors of the Contemplatives of Ashok were humanoids of vast intellect who unlocked occult powers. They deliberately evolved their mental faculties at the expense of their physical forms, and their atrophied bodies dangle beneath giant brains.
