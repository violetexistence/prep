Thasteron khefaks are alchemically enhanced versions of standard khefaks, capable of converting the minerals they eat into thasteron. While thasteron remains highly valuable as fuel and for specialized weapons, finding an experienced thasteron khefak breeder is hard because the creatures become radioactive over time.

This unusual arthropod resembles an amalgam of a centipede and a crab. Hard-shelled and perfectly suited to life on Akiton, khefaks are so incredibly useful that a visitor to the planet might assume they were custom engineered for their environs. Such visitors would, in fact, be correct. While khefaks can be found naturally on Akiton, a new species has recently gained a foothold on the planet: alchemically engineered khefaks who excrete a refined substance that can be used as fuel to power advanced engines and devices.
