He makes an `Athletics check` check against the target's Fortitude DC. On a success, the foe is planted waist-deep in the ground and is immobilized and off-guard until it Escapes (DC 22). On a critical success, the foe is completely buried and must hold its breath until it is free or else start suffocating. A successful Escape returns the foe to its original square on the surface, or the closest unoccupied square."
