    desc: "  If a boggard hunter hits a creature with her tongue, that creature becomes [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]]. Unlike with a normal grab, the creature isn't [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]], but it can't move beyond the reach of the boggard hunter's tongue.\n\nA creature can sever the tongue by hitting AC 22 and dealing at least 7 slashing damage. Though this doesn't deal any damage to the boggard, it prevents it from using their tongue Strike until they regrows their tongue, which takes a week."
