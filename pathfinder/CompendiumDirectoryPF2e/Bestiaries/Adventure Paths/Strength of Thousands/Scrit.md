Scrits are short, spindly gremlins with gray or beige leathery skin and a coat of smeared ink on their fingers. They make themselves the nightmare of many scribes and librarians, as they delight in nothing more than destroying books, scrolls, artwork, and other records or writing. The oils on a scrit's skin smears ink and renders text-even magical writing-completely illegible. Once they have smeared every page of a book, scrits devour them whole, absorbing the contents the book used to hold. After eating books they find stupid or funny, scrits hold skits for other gremlins which mock the mortal authors for the amusement of the other fey.

Gremlins are malicious fey that infest and prey upon mortal communities. They live in tunnels, beneath eaves, and in abandoned buildings, stealing what they need from their neighbors instead of creating for themselves.

While there are gremlins of any and every gender, their appearances don't differ by gender. Young gremlins grow to maturity with alarming speed. Their entire nest raises them communally, though they are often encouraged to wander unsupervised and create mischief away from home instead of inside it.
