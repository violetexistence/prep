    desc: " (divine,fire) When the sun mage is destroyed, they explode in a blast of flame that deals 6d6 fire damage in a 10-foot emanation (`DC 27 Reflex check` save). Creatures that critically fail their saves are marked with Walkena's religious symbol on a visible area of their body, which remains for 1 day. This mark allows Walkena to treat the creature as if he knew the creature's identity but not having met them for the purposes of [[Spells/Scrying|Scrying]], lowering the spell's DC by 2. The sun mage's gear and treasure are unaffected by the explosion and left in a pile where they die."

If the sun mage's next action is to Cast a Spell with the fire trait that deals damage and isn't a cantrip, the spell doesn't deal any damage. It instead restores a number of Hit Points equal to four times the spell's rank to all targets or creatures. This restoration affects all creatures regardless of whether they are healed by vitality or void energy."
