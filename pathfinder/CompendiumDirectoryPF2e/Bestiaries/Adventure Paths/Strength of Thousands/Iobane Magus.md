    desc: "`pf2:2`  **Frequency** Until recharged\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The Iobane magus Casts a Spell that takes 1 or 2 actions to cast and requires a spell attack roll. The effects of the spell do not occur immediately but are imbued into the attack instead. The Iobane magus makes a melee Strike. The spell is coupled with the attack, using the attack roll result to determine the effects of both the Strike and the spell.\n\nThis counts as two attacks for the Iobane magus' multiple attack penalty, but don't apply the penalty until after they have completed the Spellstrike.\n\nAfter the Iobane magus uses Spellstrike, they can't do so again until they recharges their Spellstrike as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. The Iobane magus also recharges their Spellstrike when they casts a conflux spell."
