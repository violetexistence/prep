Squat, surly, and perpetually covered in wet mud, gnagrifs are gremlins that infest and destroy homes. They possess sharklike faces and two sets of jaws, allowing them to open their mouths 180 degrees and clamp onto flat rocks and walls. They delight in keeping their presence hidden, chewing holes into walls and foundations that weaken structures but don't bring them down until their inhabitants slam their doors too hard or step in the wrong place. Soon as the unwitting victims spring the trap, the building collapses around them.

Like all fey, gnagrifs detest iron. Gnagrifs become obsessively vengeful if they accidentally swallow an iron nail or hinge, terrorizing families or whole villages for generations over the slight.

* * *

Gremlins are malicious fey that infest and prey upon mortal communities. They live in tunnels, beneath eaves, and in abandoned buildings, stealing what they need from their neighbors instead of creating for themselves.

While there are gremlins of any and every gender, their appearances don't differ by gender. Young gremlins grow to maturity with alarming speed. Their entire nest raises them communally, though they are often encouraged to wander unsupervised and create mischief away from home instead of inside it.
