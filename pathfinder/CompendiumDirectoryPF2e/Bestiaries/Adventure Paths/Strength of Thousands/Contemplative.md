A contemplative can't properly wield a two-handed weapon or object without dedicating its telekinetic powers to supporting the weapon, and even then, it takes a -2 penalty to Strikes with such a weapon.

Even the average contemplative demonstrates an intellect that far surpasses those of most other beings.
