    desc: "`pf2:1` (incapacitation,mental,possession,primal) A formian queen transfers her consciousness to the body of any formian within range of her telepathy to whom she has a line of effect. As long as the queen's consciousness is outside her body, her body is [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]] (though she is aware if any damage is dealt to it).\n\nAn unwilling target can attempt a `DC 38 Will check` saving throw to resist being possessed, but the queen's offspring are part of her hive mind and thus are almost always willing. The queen receives all sensory input from the target creature; she can speak through it, and she can use her own modifier for Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and Charisma-based skill checks.\n\nIf the target creature is slain or moves to a different plane from the queen's body, the queen returns to her own body immediately and is [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]]; otherwise, she can return to her own body as a free action, ending the possession effect."

Upon recovering from the stunned condition, the creature becomes sickened 2."

The formian queen is the center of the formian hive. The queen identifies and attends to the hive's needs, laying egg clusters that vary from a single formian born to a particular task to hundreds of workers at a time. All formians are born with an instinctive deference for the queen that borders on slavish devotion, though this urge can be corrupted, as with the King of Biting Ants' mutant mageslayers.

* * *

Formians resemble unusually large ants with an insectile humanoid's upper torso. More powerful or influential formians are physically larger; common formian workers are roughly the height of a gnome, while the largest formians, such as taskmasters and queens, rival a giant in size.

Formian society is a strict matriarchy. Though each hive's queen is theoretically independent and her rule absolute, allegiances are common, and less powerful hives often (grudgingly) defer to more powerful matriarchs.
