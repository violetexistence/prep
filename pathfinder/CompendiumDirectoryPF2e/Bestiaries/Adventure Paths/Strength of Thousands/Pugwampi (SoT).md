Mean, dog-faced, and craven, pugwampis take disproportionate enjoyment from the accidents and missteps of other creatures-something that happens often due to the supernatural aura of ill fortune these gremlins project. They enjoy preparing pranks involving spikes, excrement, pits full of spiders, and the like. Pugwampis are somewhat deaf and thus often yell loudly to each other when not hiding. Many pugwampis worship gnolls as gods and aspire to be more like gnolls, although gnolls hate pugwampis even more than most creatures do, due to their sycophantic fawning.

Gremlins are cruel fey tricksters and saboteurs who have fully acclimated to life on the Material Plane, finding distinct niches for their inventive destructiveness. All gremlins delight in ruining or breaking things, whether it's something physical like a device or vehicle or something intangible such as an alliance or relationship. A gremlin's greatest joy is watching the collapse of complex creations, preferably after the lightest and slightest, carefully targeted push from the gremlin. Gremlins tend to denigrate, bully, or even slaughter their lesser kin, particularly mitflits, whom gremlins (and many others) derisively call "mites."
