That creature uses the result one degree of success worse than its Fortitude save result against Constrict, but it is then no longer Grabbed or restrained by the ant.\n* * *\n\nThe monster deals the listed amount of damage to any number of creatures [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]] by it. Each of those creatures can attempt a basic Fortitude save with the listed DC."

    desc: "`pf2:2` (olfactory) The red commander ant gives a pheromone signal to spur other ants into a fury.

    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate) The red commander ant designates a single creature within 60 feet that it can see as its queen's enemy. All ants within 120 feet of the red commander ant deal an additional 1d8 bleed damage when they hit the target with mandibles Strikes. These effects last for 1 minute, or until the red commander ant uses The Queen's Enemy on a different creature."

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead spend an action to use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."
