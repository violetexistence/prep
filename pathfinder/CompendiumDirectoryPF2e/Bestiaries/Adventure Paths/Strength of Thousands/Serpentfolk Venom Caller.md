Once per turn, starting the turn after the venom caller uses Venom Pool, the venom caller can use a single action, which has the concentrate trait, to increase the radius of the burst by 5 feet. The pool of venom lasts for 1 minute, at which time it evaporates without a trace."

Venom callers are zyss serpentfolk spellcasters that specialize in the use of acid and poison magic, viewing them as natural extensions of their inherent venom. They have a reputation for bold action, something that puts them at odds with other zyss who prefer stealth and subterfuge. When a venom caller can't eliminate their rivals to seize control of their colony, they often leave in a dramatic demonstration of arrogance, insisting that slithering in shadows does the serpentfolk cause no favors.

Though venom callers aren't considered subtle by their kin, their schemes-which often revolve around acquiring rare magical lore-can nevertheless take humanoid communities by surprise. Venom callers often lure away unsuspecting victims, murder them, and disfigure their venom-wracked bodies with acid; the venom caller then assumes the victim's form. Authorities, believing all members of the community are accounted for, assume the unrecognizable corpse must have been a traveler. Most venom callers have broken with other serpentfolk communities and have no qualms about murdering their kin or infiltrating other serpentfolk cells if it serves their purposes.

Ancient and cunning, the once mighty serpentfolk have suffered numerous setbacks and indignities since the decapitation of their god, Ydersius, millennia ago. Scattered in isolated pockets, the reptilian humanoids constantly scheme their return to glory. Though many serpentfolk labor to restore Ydersius and reclaim power through him, others pursue different avenues to greatness, such as by mastering uncanny magic or practicing spycraft to take down enemy organizations from the inside.
