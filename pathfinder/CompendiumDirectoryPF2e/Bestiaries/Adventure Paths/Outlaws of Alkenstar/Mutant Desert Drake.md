Mana Wastes mutated desert drake

A mutant desert drake often dwells in regions where magic has transformed the desert sands into sheets of glass or growths of strangely growing crystals.

The magic-warping effects of the Mana Wastes extend to the life forces of creatures unfortunate enough to become lost in the cursed desert. Those who undergo the wasteland's most dramatic metamorphoses are referred to as Mana Wastes mutants.
