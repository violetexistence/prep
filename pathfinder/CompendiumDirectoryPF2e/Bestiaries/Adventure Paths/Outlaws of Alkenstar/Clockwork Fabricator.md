    desc: "  24 hours, `DC 19 Thievery check` check, standby\n* * *\n\nFor a clockwork to act, it must be wound with a unique key by another creature. This takes 1 minute. Once wound, it remains operational for the listed amount of time, usually 24 hours, after which time it becomes unaware of its surroundings and can't act until it's wound again. Some clockworks' abilities require them to spend some of their remaining operational time. They can't spend more than they have and shut down immediately once they have 0 time remaining. If it's unclear when a clockwork was last wound, most clockwork keepers wind all their clockworks at a set time, typically 8 a.m.\n\nA clockwork that lists standby in its wind-up entry can enter standby mode as a 3-action activity. Its operational time doesn't decrease in standby, but it can sense its surroundings (with a -2 penalty to Perception). It can't act, with one exception: when it perceives a creature, it can exit standby as a reaction (rolling initiative if appropriate).\n\nA creature can attempt to Disable a Device to wind a clockwork down (with a DC listed in the wind-up entry). For each success, the clockwork loses 1 hour of operational time. This can be done even if the clockwork is in standby mode."

Clockwork creatures are as common in Alkenstar as carts and horses are in most Inner Sea region cities. In the City of Smog, clockworks perform many of the simple, repetitive tasks that sentient workers find boring, as well as dangerous jobs such as private security or riot control.

A common sight among Alkenstar work crews, construction teams, and mining operations, the clockwork fabricator is a one-size-fits-all construction companion. These clockworks can be programmed to perform up to two simple, repetitive tasks such as hauling equipment, chopping down trees, or grinding up hunks of ore. The modular nature of these units makes them even more valuable-after finishing a day's work sawing planks, the same machine can be unwound, updated with a new modular arm or two, and then re-wound and given new instructions.

While it's possible to remove or replace an arm while a fabricator in use, doing so is dangerous and likely to void the manufacturer's warranty, to say nothing of the danger posed to the engineer doing the retrofitting.
