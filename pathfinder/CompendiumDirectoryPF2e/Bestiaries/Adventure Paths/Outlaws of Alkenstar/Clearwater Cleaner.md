This area fills with tangling vines, becoming difficult terrain. If the terrain is not a viable environment for the vines, they wither after 24 hours."

    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,polymorph,primal) The vine leshy transforms into a Small plant with vines. This ability otherwise uses the effects of [[Spells/One with Plants|One with Plants]].\n* * *\n\nThe monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

    desc: "`pf2:1`  The vine leshy Interacts to extend or shorten their arms. With limbs extended, the vine leshy has a 10-foot reach. The leshy can't use weapons that already have reach in this way, because they would be unable to keep their balance."

    desc: "`pf2:2` (manipulate) **Requirements** The Clearwater Cleaner is adjacent to a crate\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The Clearwater Cleaner picks up a crate and heaves it up to 15 feet. Upon landing, the crate breaks open in a 5-foot burst. Each creature within the area takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage (`DC 13 Reflex check`), and the area becomes difficult terrain until cleared."

male and female vine leshys

Often found assisting practitioners of nature magic, leshys are sentient flora that protect the natural world and sacred spaces within forests, fields, and other environments. Leshys are nature spirits inhabiting bodies constructed of plant matter fused together by a primal ritual.

* * *

Irrepressible vine leshys love to explore and collect tales to share. They're curious without being reckless. Other cultures interest them greatly, and they can build friendships quickly as they trade stories with traveling companions. They also feel a pull toward protection, much like other leshys. Vine leshys, though, tend to protect a ward for only a brief period of danger before the leshy's wanderlust drives them onward into the unknown.
