    desc: "(3 actions; misfortune) The gremlin horde hurls one tinkering curse with each action, targeting an item within 60 feet wielded or worn by a creature. The creature must attempt a `DC 27 Will check` save. The gremlin horde loses 1 action for each gremlin gang that's scattered.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The hex bounces back to affect the gremlin horde. For 1 round, all creatures gain a +1 status bonus to checks to disable this hazard.\n\n**Success** The item is unaffected.\n\n**Failure** The item becomes unreliable for 1 round. If a creature attempts to Activate the item or Interact with it, it must succeed at a `DC 5 Flat check` or the action is wasted. If the item doesn't have an active use (such a mundane cloak), the creature wearing the item must instead immediately succeed at a `DC 5 Flat check` or become tangled with the item and fall [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]].\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature wielding or wearing the item also becomes [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 2]]."
