    desc: "  24 hours, [[Actions/disable-device dc=26|disable-device dc=26]]{DC 26 Thievery}, standby\n\nFor a clockwork to act, it must be wound with a unique key by another creature. This takes 1 minute. Once wound, it remains operational for the listed amount of time, usually 24 hours, after which time it becomes unaware of its surroundings and can't act until it's wound again. Some clockworks' abilities require them to spend some of their remaining operational time. They can't spend more than they have and shut down immediately once they have 0 time remaining. If it's unclear when a clockwork was last wound, most clockwork keepers wind all their clockworks at a set time, typically 8 a.m.\n\nA clockwork that lists standby in its wind-up entry can enter standby mode as a 3-action activity. Its operational time doesn't decrease in standby, but it can sense its surroundings (with a -2 penalty to Perception). It can't act, with one exception: when it perceives a creature, it can exit standby as a reaction (rolling initiative if appropriate).\n\nA creature can attempt to Disable a Device to wind a clockwork down (with a DC listed in the wind-up entry). For each success, the clockwork loses 1 hour of operational time. This can be done even if the clockwork is in standby mode."

Variant clockwork buccaneer

Clockwork buccaneers are powerful constructs designed for naval combat. Whereas most clockwork creations sink to the ocean floor while at sea, clockwork buccaneers can use their water jets to easily propel themselves through the water or leap aboard enemy ships. In addition to an internal water tank and hydraulic pumps, most clockwork buccaneers are equipped with a cutlass and arm gun loaded with scatter shot.

As one delves deeper into the industrial heart of Alkenstar, the clockwork adversaries one faces become ever more complex and deadly.
