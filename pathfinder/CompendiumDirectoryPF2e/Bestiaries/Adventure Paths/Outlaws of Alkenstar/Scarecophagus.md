Originally created by Gebbite necromancers during the war against Nex, the scarecophagus is an evil construct that draws power directly from the undead mummy trapped forever within its sealed core. This necromantic energy is channeled throughout the construct's body, allowing it to scuttle about on legs of stone, animate tentacles to strike at foes, and use the mummy's trapped mind for its own sapience and magical powers.
