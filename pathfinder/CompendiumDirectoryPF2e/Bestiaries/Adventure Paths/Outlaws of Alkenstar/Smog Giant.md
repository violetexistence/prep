  - name: "Shrapnel"
    desc: "  A smog giant has a dozen implanted knives, rocks, chunks of metal, spikes, and other adornments that they can fire from their body with great force to make ranged shrapnel Strikes. Once a smog giant has used all 12 shots, they must replace them one at a time using a 1-minute Interact activity."

Corrupting magical storms and the interference of unethical gear- smiths birthed the first of the so-called smog giants. These hot-tempered behemoths all originate from a clan of unfortunate hill giants which became so attuned to their strange environment they developed unique mutations and incredibly violent dispositions. For all their physical abnormalities, it's still fair to say the violent confrontations common along the Western Ravage are the true cause of smog giants' monstrous nature.

Smog giants can eat meat and bone, but they prefer diets of black powder and the raw materials that make up this alchemical concoction. Their bodies store repositories of the stuff infused with the unstable occult energies that lace their flesh, granting them the ability to "crack" these pockets of subdermal explosives when they attack, much like a tough cracking their knuckles during a fight. In this case however, the results are much more violentâ€”especially when coupled with the large quantities of weaponized body piercings and adornments smog giants often wear.
