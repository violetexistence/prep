Any creature under the portcullis when it drops takes 4d10+18 piercing damage and is [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]]. A creature that succeeds at a `DC 26 Reflex check` save takes no damage and rolls away in a random direction; on a critical success, they can choose the direction.\n\nIf the trap was triggered by a creature moving north with a Speed of at least 10 feet, they're considered to be under the portcullis when it triggers. Creatures moving south when triggering the portcullis aren't considered to be under the portcullis when it triggers."
