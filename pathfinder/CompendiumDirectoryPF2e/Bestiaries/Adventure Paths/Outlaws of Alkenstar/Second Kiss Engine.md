    desc: "`pf2:r` **Trigger** A creature Strides in the engine nacelle\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The creature's clothing or limbs get caught in the spinning gears and axles of the engine. The creature must attempt a `DC 24 Reflex check` save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature takes 2d8+9 bludgeoning damage.\n\n**Failure** The creature takes 4d8+18 bludgeoning damage.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature's clothing is pulled into the clockworks. The creature takes 4d8+18 bludgeoning damage and is [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]. Until the creature [[Actions/Escape|Escapes]] (DC 24), it takes 2d8+9 bludgeoning damage each round as it's pulled into the spinning rotors. A creature wearing clothing can automatically Escape by doffing its caught clothing; this destroys the doffed clothing."
