Shock zombies are hideous undead covered with bolts and electrical wiring. Most have two large electric coils mounted on their backs to absorb and project electricity. If uncontrolled, shock zombies often wander far afield in search of inventors' labs or lightning storms to draw power from. In a pinch, the natural electric currents inside living creatures more than suffice.
