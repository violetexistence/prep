During the height of the legendary war between Nex and Geb, Nex's agents grew increasingly creative in their "recruiting" methods for their armies. One such effort involved the construction of mechanical soldiers powered by arcane engines but directed by transplanted minds. While the process generally involved willing donors who were eager to give up dying bodies to "live on" in constructed frames, rumors persist that Nex harvested the minds of prisoners of war and criminals for these creations.

Today, thousands of years after those wars ended, hundreds of daelums still live. Their intellects have, in large part, fully embraced their new "lives," and very few remember their previous existences today. Daelums can be found throughout the Mana Wastes serving as guides, porters, mine workers, and mercenaries.
