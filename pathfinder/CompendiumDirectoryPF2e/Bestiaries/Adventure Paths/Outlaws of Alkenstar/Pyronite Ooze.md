    desc: "  Tremorsense allows a monster to feel the vibrations through a solid surface caused by movement. It is an imprecise sense with a limited range (listed in the ability). Tremorsense functions only if the monster is on the same surface as the subject, and only if the subject is moving along (or burrowing through) the surface."

This explosion can't cause other pyronite oozes to split. After exploding, the ooze splits into two Medium pyronite oozes, each with half the original's HP, which each fly through the air and land 15 feet from the original ooze in a random direction. If no space is unoccupied where the ooze would land, it automatically pushes creatures and objects out of the way to fill a space (the GM decides if an object or creature is too big or sturdy to push)."

With the discovery of the incredible gelatinous explosive called pyronite, it was perhaps inevitable alchemical monstrosities made of the stuff would soon follow. So-called pyronite oozes sometimes spontaneously manifest from stockpiles of pyronite or other powerful explosives, typically amid mana storms or when affected by powerful magic.

Pyronite oozes have an extremely unstable life cycle and are defined by their ability to continuously explode and reform themselves. A pyronite ooze's violent explosions hinder observations, making it difficult to learn anything from the volatile jelly. To complicate matters further, pyronite oozes seem drawn to other unstable alchemical concoctions. Test subjects brought to the Spellscar Desert have been observed bathing themselves in pools of magic-polluted effluvia. Although they typically reform into a single entity after exploding, pyronite oozes bathed in chemicals sometimes remain apart after splitting, creating two independent oozes. Some speculate that an as yet unknown reagent must be essential for the oozes to reproduce on their own.
