Cranium preservers serve necromancers as walking laboratories for undead. A typical cranium preserver has a metallic and spider-like body, which holds aloft a large central glass vat surrounded by a dozen or more smaller, head-sized glass vats. Each vat is filled with a special embalming fluid that can preserve the minds of slain enemies.
