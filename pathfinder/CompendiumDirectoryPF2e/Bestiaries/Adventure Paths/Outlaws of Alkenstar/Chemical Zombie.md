Variant sulfur zombies

Necromancers most often create these mindless undead as obedient, expendable servitors. Left to its own devices, a zombie seeks only to consume the living, stopping only when its rotting body can no longer hold together.

Glowing with a dull amber light, these odious creatures spawn from a combination of necromancy and fire. These destructive creations sow chaos and demolish fortifications, making them the bane of besieged cities.
