    desc: "  A nyktera whose hospitality is betrayed becomes enraged at the violation of a fundamental aspect of their fey nature. They must succeed at a `DC 20 Will check` save or begin involuntarily attacking the traitor. At the end of each of their turns, if they choose, they can attempt another Will save to end the effect; otherwise, the effect lasts until the traitor is subdued or leaves the nyktera's presence. As long as their righteous fury lasts, the nyktera gains a +2 status bonus to attack and damage rolls for their fist Strikes.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Wrath of Spurned Hospitality|Effect: Wrath of Spurned Hospitality]]"
