    desc: " (aura,occult,visual) 30 feet. The Claws of Time's eyes glow balefully, causing painful but bloodless wounds to rip open in the body of a creature that meets its awful gaze.

  - name: "Angled Entry"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  The Claws of Time casts a 4th-rank [[Spells/Translocate|Translocate]] spell, but it must transport itself into a space adjacent to an angle of 90ยบ (or more acute) in the structure or environment around it. This means the hound can use _dimension door_ to appear adjacent to any wall or corner in the Cradle of Quartz except for the central geode (area **D16**).\n\nOnce per day, the hound can use this ability to [[Spells/Interplanar Teleport|Interplanar Teleport]] to or from the Dimension of Time, with the same restrictions on what angles next to which it can appear."
