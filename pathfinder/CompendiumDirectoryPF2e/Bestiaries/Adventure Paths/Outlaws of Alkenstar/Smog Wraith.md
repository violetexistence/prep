    desc: "  A living humanoid slain by a smog wraith's noxious hand Strike rises as a smog wraith spawn after 1d4 rounds. This spawn is under the command of the smog wraith that killed it. It doesn't have noxious smog or smog wraith spawn and becomes [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 2]] for as long as it's a smog wraith spawn. If the creator of the spawn dies, the spawn becomes a full-fledged, autonomous smog wraith; it regains its free will, gains smog wraith spawn and noxious smog, and is no longer clumsy."

Clouds of choking fumes and toxic smog continuously shroud these potent undead. They constantly belch forth noxious vapors and find great humor in the death of creatures too weak to resist their vile fumes. These fetid vapors are so dense the corpses of a smog wraith's victims can float among them.

Though it's possible to create smog wraiths through necromancy, most are the result of industrialists, inventors, and polluters who in life relished opportunities to exploit nature for profit, power, or prestige. In death, these wretched souls can rise as smog wraiths to continue their spoliation.
