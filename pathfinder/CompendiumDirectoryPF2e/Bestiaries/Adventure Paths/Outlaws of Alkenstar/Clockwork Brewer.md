  - name: "Standard Greeting"
    desc: "  Clockwork brewers have a limited set of pre-recorded phrases they can use to interact with clientele, based on their instructions. The audio is recorded on an embedded gemstone worth 5 gp. Removing a gemstone from or installing a gemstone into a clockwork brewer requires a successful [[Actions/disable-device dc=18|disable-device dc=18]]{DC 18 Thievery} check to Disable a Device; on a failure, the gemstone is undamaged, but any recorded sounds are erased."

    desc: "  24 hours, [[Actions/disable-device dc=18|disable-device dc=18]]{DC 18 Thievery} check, standby\n* * *\n\nFor a clockwork to act, it must be wound with a unique key by another creature. This takes 1 minute. Once wound, it remains operational for the listed amount of time, usually 24 hours, after which time it becomes unaware of its surroundings and can't act until it's wound again. Some clockworks' abilities require them to spend some of their remaining operational time. They can't spend more than they have and shut down immediately once they have 0 time remaining. If it's unclear when a clockwork was last wound, most clockwork keepers wind all their clockworks at a set time, typically 8 a.m.\n\nA clockwork that lists standby in its wind-up entry can enter standby mode as a 3-action activity. Its operational time doesn't decrease in standby, but it can sense its surroundings (with a -2 penalty to Perception). It can't act, with one exception: when it perceives a creature, it can exit standby as a reaction (rolling initiative if appropriate).\n\nA creature can attempt to Disable a Device to wind a clockwork down (with a DC listed in the wind-up entry). For each success, the clockwork loses 1 hour of operational time. This can be done even if the clockwork is in standby mode."

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

Clockwork creatures are as common in Alkenstar as carts and horses are in most Inner Sea region cities. In the City of Smog, clockworks perform many of the simple, repetitive tasks that sentient workers find boring, as well as dangerous jobs such as private security or riot control.

With the rise of the automated workforce in Alkenstar came the "professional" line of clockworks, capable of carrying out more complex tasks and even interacting with the public. These clockworks were given modules inscribed with information and procedures for carrying out a specific profession. The clockwork brewer is one such example, capable of extracting wort, stirring a fermenter, or monitoring a boiling temperature. As many other types of clockwork professional exist as there are professions; clockworks have been programmed to reshelf library books, swab ship decks, and fill holes in heavily trafficked roads.

Clockwork professionals made by reputable manufacturers are generally considered safe to interact with the public. Accidents have been known to occur, however, particularly when careless engineers fail to perform regular maintenance checks or when operators program a clockwork with insufficiently specific directives. Flesh and blood laborers forced to work in close proximity to a clockwork professional tend to keep a wide berth.
