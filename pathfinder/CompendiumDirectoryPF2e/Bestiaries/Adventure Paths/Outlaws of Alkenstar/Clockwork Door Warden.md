    desc: "  24 hours, [[Actions/disable-device dc=19|disable-device dc=19]]{DC 19 Thievery}, standby\n* * *\n\nFor a clockwork to act, it must be wound with a unique key by another creature. This takes 1 minute. Once wound, it remains operational for the listed amount of time, usually 24 hours, after which time it becomes unaware of its surroundings and can't act until it's wound again. Some clockworks' abilities require them to spend some of their remaining operational time. They can't spend more than they have and shut down immediately once they have 0 time remaining. If it's unclear when a clockwork was last wound, most clockwork keepers wind all their clockworks at a set time, typically 8 a.m.\n\nA clockwork that lists standby in its wind-up entry can enter standby mode as a 3-action activity. Its operational time doesn't decrease in standby, but it can sense its surroundings (with a -2 penalty to Perception). It can't act, with one exception: when it perceives a creature, it can exit standby as a reaction (rolling initiative if appropriate).\n\nA creature can attempt to Disable a Device to wind a clockwork down (with a DC listed in the wind-up entry). For each success, the clockwork loses 1 hour of operational time. This can be done even if the clockwork is in standby mode."

This mechanical humanoid serves the role of a gatekeeper or even a greeter, but its strength also enables it to repel unwanted visitors.

In the Grand Duchy of Alkenstar, the creation of constructs is complicated by the intermittent interference of the nearby Mana Wastes. Golems and animated objects depend on lengthy magical rituals that the magic-warping effects of the Wastes often disrupt, but clockwork constructs use far less magic in their creation. A clockwork device replaces magical intricacy with superb manufacturing skill, using magic only for the final acts of animating and powering the device. Skilled local creators and inventors rarely follow someone else's design, so most clockworks found in Alkenstar are custom creations with abilities designed for a specific purpose or individual's needs.
