Variant elite sand sentry

Shifting back and forth between a detailed likeness of a human and a muted and featureless bipedal form, this creature of pure sand moves with an eerie grace. The sand sentry is often called upon by spellcasters to stand guard over an area of great importance-these elementals are patient participants in such roles, making them well suited for long-term service.
