Variant Captain Of The Guard

The captain of the guard leads a troop of soldiers who serve as security forces for a powerful individual, most often a high-ranking noble or very rich merchant, though this stat block could also represent a lower-ranking captain of the guard for the leader of a nation. A formidable opponent in their own right, the captain of the guard skillfully employs their troops to protect the life and health of their ward.

Larger societies rely on those with the authority and the ability to interpret and enforce laws. In good-aligned societies, these officials carry out their duties fairly. In neutral and evil ones, these officials can be harsh and cruel (with an altered alignment to reflect this), imposing severe punishments on those who can't pay for mercy.
