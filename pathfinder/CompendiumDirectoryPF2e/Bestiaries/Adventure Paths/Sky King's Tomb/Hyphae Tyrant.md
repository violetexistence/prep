    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,polymorph) The hyphae tyrant transforms into a Small fungus. This ability otherwise uses the effects of [[Spells/One with Plants|One with Plants]].\n* * *\n\nThe monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

Leshy creations sometimes fall prey to herbivores and foragers. Whereas most take the loss in stride, fungus leshies sometimes grow bitter and explore the grimmer elements of fungi: decomposition and possession. Combining unethical experiments, mind-altering cordyceps spores, and occult magic fueled by their own victim narrative, a fungus leshy can transform into a hyphae tyrant, who in turn transforms corpses into sporeborn puppets to torment local fauna. These leshies' greatest tragedy is perhaps their own impermanence. As their agendas increasingly celebrate decay, a hyphae tyrant's spite and occult narrative slowly drain their life force, ultimately ending in a final burst of destructive energy.

## Troubled Reincarnation

Typically, a leshy's spirit wanders the natural world after death, eventually inhabiting a new leshy body. It's unclear whether a hyphae tyrant's spirit can ever become a new leshy. It's speculated that they eventually become natural haunts, transform into oni, or even fade forever unless found and redeemed.
