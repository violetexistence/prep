Early in the alghollthu's attempt to control the sapient creatures of Golarion, they created the ungothol to feed them information. These slime-covered creatures would infiltrate humanoid settlements and send back information to their masters using powerful telepathy. Over centuries, the slime puppeteers proved inferior compared to the more versatile faceless stalkers. Slime puppeteers disguise themselves as their humanoid meals. They envelop their target, killing it, then the puppeteer's skin and the corpse's skin both become gelatinous and merge. The puppeteer's form replaces the outer layer of the corpse's body, while long, wiry tendrils implant themselves in the corpses' nervous system. The result is a nearly-perfect copy of the dead creature, now controlled from within by the sinister alghollthu agent. The slime puppeteer can speak using the dead creature's voice, though without the original creature's language or memories.

The alghollthu that ruled Golarion for millennia created numerous hideous creatures using torturous processes and magic; many yet survive.

## Puppeteer Variations

The slime puppeteer is only one attempt at creating a terrestrial spy; the alghollthu created countless more. It's challenging to tell how many of their kind survived until the modern day. Some slime puppeteers traded the sensitivity to hot environments for cold. Others were massively enlarged, targeting various giant communities. There are even rumors of elemental-infused slime puppeteers capable of infiltrating the elemental planes, but so far no solid evidence has been presented to recognized scholars.
