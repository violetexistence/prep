Creatures it moves past or lands on take 5d6 bludgeoning damage and are forced to move west to the first available space (`DC 27 Reflex check`). Creatures who critically succeed at the Reflex save are not damaged but are still moved west. If the rolling stone tries to move into a non-creature obstruction, such as a wall or barricade, it deals bludgeoning damage to the obstruction and only continues moving if the obstruction is destroyed, otherwise the trap stops."
