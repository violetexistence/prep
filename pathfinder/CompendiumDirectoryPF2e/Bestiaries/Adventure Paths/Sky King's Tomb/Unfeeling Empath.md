The soul of a gnome killed by tragedy sometimes becomes so entangled in conflicting emotions that it becomes trapped and reanimates its own corpse. Known as unfeeling empaths, these undead wander in search of others' emotions. When they find thinking prey, they relentlessly goad that creature to elicit and consume their feelings. Though initially harmless, feeding drives an unfeeling empath into an expressive frenzy as they overload the victim's mind, resuming their senses only after their prey is dead.

## Misery Loves Company

Unfeeling empaths appreciate any companions who can endure their outbursts. Lost souls and beings who prey on emotions sometimes adopt an unfeeling empath out of solidarity or because the undead gnomes are easy to torment. Thus, where these creatures appear, a sakhil, will-o'-wisp, or ghost is often nearby.
