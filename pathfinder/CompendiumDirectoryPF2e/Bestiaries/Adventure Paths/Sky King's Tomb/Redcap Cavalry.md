Whomever first imagined putting a fey with a bloodsoaked hat on a giant blood-crazed insect certainly had a sense of humor, but that didn't stop the redcaps from trying to domesticate and train giant bloodseekers. Although a flying cavalry was Queen Frilogarma's goal, her court ended up accidentally inventing redcap racing. In this sport, one redcap with a freshly soaked cap is swung around a racetrack by a giant arm while several other redcaps on giant bloodseekers fly after them. The "bait" redcap doesn't usually survive, but they are the center of attention for about two minutes.

* * *

In the Ether Court, redcaps train to ride giant bloodseeker specially bred to be mounts. While their fey cousins outside the court see this as folly, redcap courtiers consider riding bloodseekers a noble sport.

## That Bloody Hat

Even when a redcap isn't taking persistent bleed damage, their red caps drip crimson, soaked in the blood of their enemies. This is more than enough to provoke creatures who react strongly to the scent of blood. Creatures with scent treat a redcap as a creature taking persistent bleed damage.
