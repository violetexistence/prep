When not being controlled and manipulated by alghollthus, ulat-kinis have found they can develop formidable psychic powers. Those who master this craft are dubbed "mindreavers" by their awestruck kin.

## Ulat-Kini Culture

The creatures who surface humanoids consider scum still hold grand empires beneath the waves. While some ulat-kinis still revere the alghollthu who created them and others have learned to hate their creators, there are ulat-kinis who have found a new way forward. They have developed their own culture outside of alghollthu influence, founding new underwater traditions and creating new cultural standards.
