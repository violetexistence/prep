One ether sprite is quite enough for most, and can be tiresome for even the fey. When a group of them get together, it's outright bedlam.

The fey of the Ether Court in the Darklands have evolved somewhat differently from the First World kin that exiled them, becoming more cruel and less mischievous than is typical for their kind.

## Sprite Collections

Ether sprites have a reputation for being thieves. In truth, they're generally curious about the world and simply have a tendency to walk away with objects that don't belong to them, not understanding the concept of ownership. As a result, ether sprites tend to have small interesting objects in their possession, such as talismans or gemstones.
