In secret conclaves around Nar-Voth, hidden in plain sight within hryngar settlements, are the workshops and training grounds for the Darklands' most technologically sophisticated group of killers. Most hryngar assassins train from childhood, having been recruited from orphanages, and are under a life-debt obligation to their guild leader. While on contract, hryngar assassins are on the lookout for new technologies, gadgets, and alchemical creations. They bring what they find back to their guild to be reverse engineered and replicated for other guild assassins. When the opportunity presents itself, they destroy the schematics and formulae that other organizations, inventors, and alchemists have created if they can't steal them.

Deep under the surface of Golarion, dwarves still dwell in the darkness. Once abandoned by their kin who were obsessed with reaching the surface, these dwarves have found that by working harder than their brethren, they can build a society far greater than anything under the sun. Droskar, Master of the Dark Furnace, teaches them that toiling for their masters, who in turn toil for their masters above, will lead all of them to become stronger than ever. Every hryngar knows that their labor defines them, and brings them glory in the eyes of Droskar and their peers. Exhaustion at the end of the work day is an honor, proof of their worth in society.

## Bleeding Edge Killing Tech

Hryngar assassins use the most advanced gadgets and technology available to them. Their inventors are hard at work reverse engineering any specialized equipment they find so they can provide moderately equivalent designs to the best assassins. Elite assassins gain one consumable gadget (Pathfinder Guns & Gears) of their level or lower, often selected for a specific job.
