Variant Gang Leader

Cutthroats, killers, thieves, and toughs prey upon the vulnerable of society. Directing their activities and keeping them in line are the duties of the gang leader.

Villains pursue selfish and cruel goals, trampling over anyone foolish or purehearted enough to stand in their way.
