Lauded and shunned, caligni assassins often become unwitting pawns in clashes between caligni settlements or between rival factions of caligni society.

* * *

Calignis often get stereotyped as murderers, but the title of assassin is one of the rarest in their society. Caligni settlements go decades without having offspring born with enough potential. However, once a child shows they have "the gift"; the settlements leaders might give the babe to the owb, who mold and shape the child into an instrument of shadows and death.

## Shadowfade

Caligni assassins gain their power from an infusion of planar essence directly from the Netherworld, which the owb help them develop into powerful abilities. This comes at a cost: all caligni assassins eventually succumb to an affliction known as shadowfade. This magical malady causes the caligni's body to painfully warp when concealed in shadows, as the plane's ability to create twisted reflections of reality changes their physical form directly.

Sometimes a caligni assassin will flee home and strike out on their own to avoid becoming a twisted tool for their greedy leaders. Such freelancers are in high demand for those seeking a fatal solution to their own political problems.
