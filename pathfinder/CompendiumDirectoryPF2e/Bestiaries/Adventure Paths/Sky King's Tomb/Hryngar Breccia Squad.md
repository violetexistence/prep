  - name: "[[Compendium.pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Item.RJbI07QSiYp0SF9A|Troop Defenses]]"
    desc: "  Troops are composed of many individuals, represented by four \"segments\" on a battle grid. Each segment is 10 feet on each side and as tall as the individual members of the troop. Segments must remain contiguous. Each one has to share at least 5 feet of one of its edges with another segment—being adjacent on a diagonal isn't sufficient! You can measure flanking, cover, and the like using the center of any segment.\n\nA troop has two Hit Point thresholds in its HP entry and loses segments as it crosses thresholds. Typically, the higher threshold is at 2/3 of the troop's maximum Hit Points and the lower is at 1/3 of its maximum. Once the troop drops below the higher threshold, it loses one segment, leaving three segments (12 squares) remaining and setting the first threshold as the troop's new maximum Hit Points. This repeats when the troop drops below the lower threshold, leaving two segments (8 squares). At 0 Hit Points, the troop disperses entirely, with the few remaining members surrendering, [[Conditions/Fleeing|Fleeing]], or easily dispatched, as determined by the GM. Typically the creature who caused the troop to lose a segment decides which to remove, or the GM decides when a specific creature wasn't responsible. To restore lost segments and maximum Hit Points, a troop needs to spend downtime to use long-term treatment on casualties or recruit new members to replace the fallen.\n\nTroops are typically immune to non-damaging effects that target a single creature, such as a [[Spells/Charm|Charm]] spell or the [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] action. An ability that can target 5 or more creatures can target an entire segment, increasing to two segments if it can target 10 or more creatures and to the entire troop if it can target 20 or more creatures. An ability that affects all creatures in a certain range affects all segments in range (make any checks or saves separately for each segment). As examples, an 8th rank _charm_ spell (with 10 targets) can affect two segments, and an ability that Demoralizes all creatures within 30 feet of you would affect all segments that are fully within that range. A non-damaging ability that would prevent a segment from acting, cause them to flee, or otherwise make them unable to function as part of the troop for a round or more removes the segment entirely. The troop loses a number of HP required to bring it to the next threshold. If an ability both deals damage and has a non-damaging effect, apply the damage then the rest of the effect."

    desc: "`pf2:2`  The hryngar breccia squad draws or reloads its crossbows, then launches a ranged attack in the form of a volley. This volley is a 10-foot burst within 120 feet that deals 4d8 piercing damage (`DC 28 Reflex check` save). When the hryngar breccia squad is reduced to 8 or fewer squares, this area decreases to a 5-foot burst."

    desc: "  Whenever the hryngar breccia squad Strides, it first Forms Up as a free action to condense into a 20-foot-by-20-foot area (minus any missing squares), then moves up to its Speed. This works just like a Gargantuan creature moving; for instance, if any square of the hryngar breccia squad enters difficult terrain, the extra movement cost applies to the entire hryngar breccia squad."

  - name: "Push Back"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** The hryngar breccia squad has its shields raised\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The hryngar breccia squad pushes against adjacent foes, knocking them back. The hryngar breccia squad attempts an Athletics check to [[Actions/Shove|Shove]], comparing the result to the Fortitude DC of each enemy within 5 feet of the hryngar breccia squad. The hryngar breccia squad is not knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] on a critical failure."

A hryngar breccia squad is a group of hryngar martial combatants armed with melee weapons and steel shields. Though more likely to be encountered near large hryngar settlements, these strike forces see wide use throughout the Darklands. Hryngar breccia squads often serve as military units, mercenary companies, city patrols, and caravan guards. Like all warriors, the favored combat methods of a hryngar breccia squad change by location, often due to surrounding environment and popular equipment.

* * *

Deep under the surface of Golarion, dwarves still dwell in the darkness. Once abandoned by their kin who were obsessed with reaching the surface, these dwarves have found that by working harder than their brethren, they can build a society far greater than anything under the sun. Droskar, Master of the Dark Furnace, teaches them that toiling for their masters, who in turn toil for their masters above, will lead all of them to become stronger than ever. Every hryngar knows that their labor defines them, and brings them glory in the eyes of Droskar and their peers. Exhaustion at the end of the work day is an honor, proof of their worth in society.

## Rift Jumpers

Hryngar breccia squads that specialize in spelunking are known as Rift Jumpers, named for their reckless leaps into perilous chasms. They swap their shields and warhammers for light picks and train with their climbing equipment until it serves as an extension of their body. Rift Jumpers lose the Raise Shields, Shield Block, and Push Back actions, and gain a climb Speed of 20 feet.
