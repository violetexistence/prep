Variant male invidiak

An invidiak has no physical body and is born out of a deep sense of envy over this lack. An invidiak only feels properly "alive" when they're possessing a host. In many cases, an invidiak remains dormant in such a host, spending months, even years, observing from within and building up its influence over the host slowly, so as to cause as much long-lasting despair and emotional trauma to the host's friends and family as possible.

## Lengthy Possessions

An invidiak can possess a favored host for an unlimited amount of time, and over the course of years their influence can result in their host gaining strange new and unique supernatural powers that grow from this spiritual corruption. Such powers only function as long as the possession lasts; if the invidiak is forced out of the body, these powers vanish and don't return, even if the invidiak later re-possesses the same host. These unique invidiaks are generally much more powerful than the typical one presented here.
