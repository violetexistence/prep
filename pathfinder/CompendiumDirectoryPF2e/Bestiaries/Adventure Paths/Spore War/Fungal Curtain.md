The whistling sound alerts the occupants of area **E6**. Any non-fungus, non-demon creature within 30 feet of the fungal curtain is exposed to the flesh-eating spores and takes 8d6 poison damage and 4d6 persistent void damage (`DC 42 Fortitude check` save). The fungal curtain then rolls initiative."

  - name: "Routine"
    desc: "(3 actions) The fungal curtain takes the following actions each round in this order; the fungal curtain can perceive targets via darkvision and has a Perception modifier of +38. On its first action, it extends a thorny tentacle to attempt a melee Strike on the closest target in reachâ€”if there's no target in reach, the fungal curtain loses this action. On its second action, it fires a volley of thorny spores into area **E5**, attempting a ranged thorny spore Strike against all potential targets in the chamber. On its third action, it emits another whistling decay effect."
  - name: "Reset"
    desc: "The fungal curtain deactivates at the end of any round where there were no foes in area **E5**, then resets at the start of the next round. It restores 10 Hit Points to each damaged section every hour."
