A creature entering the aura or starting its turn in the aura must succeed at a `DC 38 Will check` save or become confused for 1 round (2d4 rounds on a critical failure).

Each of those creatures can attempt a basic Fortitude save with the listed DC."

    desc: "`pf2:2`  `DC 40 Reflex check`, 6d6 acid damage, [[Actions/escape dc=40|escape dc=40]], Rupture 40\n* * *\n\nThe monster Strides up to double its Speed and can move through the spaces of any creatures in its path. Any creature of the monster's size or smaller whose space the monster moves through can attempt a Reflex save with the listed DC to avoid being engulfed. A creature unable to act automatically critically fails this save. If a creature succeeds at its save, it can choose to be either pushed aside (out of the monster's path) or pushed in front of the monster to the end of the monster's movement. The monster can attempt to Engulf the same creature only once in a single use of Engulf. The monster can contain as many creatures as can fit in its space.\n\nA creature that fails its save is pulled into the monster's body. It is [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]], is [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]], and has to hold its breath or start suffocating. The creature takes the listed amount of damage when first engulfed and at the end of each of its turns while it's engulfed. An engulfed creature can get free by [[Actions/Escape|Escaping]] against the listed escape DC. An engulfed creature can attack the monster engulfing it, but only with unarmed attacks or with weapons of light Bulk or less. The engulfing creature is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] against the attack. If the monster takes piercing or slashing damage equaling or exceeding the listed Rupture value from a single attack or spell, the engulfed creature cuts itself free.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Engulf and Swallow Whole|Effect: Engulf and Swallow Whole]]\n\nA creature that gets free by either method can immediately breathe and exits the swallowing monster's space.\n\nIf the monster dies, all creatures it has engulfed are automatically released as the monster's form loses cohesion."

Each successive round that a fungal abomination activates this spore cloud, the range of the aura extends by 10 feet, to a maximum distance of 60 feet after six rounds of activity. A creature in the aura or that ends their turn in the aura takes 8d6 poison damage and must attempt a `DC 37 Fortitude check` save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature takes no damage.\n\n**Success** The creature takes half damage and is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the end of their next turn.\n\n**Failure** The creature takes full damage and is [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] until the end of their next turn.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and is [[Conditions/Paralyzed|Paralyzed]] until the end of their next turn."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Grab|Grab]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** The monster's last action was a successful Strike that lists Grab in its damage entry, or the monster has a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]\n* * *\n\n**Effect** If used after a Strike, the monster attempts to [[Actions/grapple|grapple]] the creature using the body part it attacked with. This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

Variant shoggoth

Although even raving fanatics and doom-saying prophets desperately claim the monstrous shoggoth is nothing more than a drug-induced vision or a thankfully unreal nightmare, the truth is altogether more dire. Shoggoths exist, yet they tend keep to the deepest of ocean trenches or the most remote of caverns and ruins, emerging to spread chaos and destruction in their slimy wakes.

The first shoggoths were created by an alien species to serve as mindless beasts of burden. Their vast bulk, incredible strength, and amorphous nature made them useful slave labor, and their ability to spontaneously form whatever new eyes, mouths, limbs, and other organs they might need made them incredibly versatile. Eventually, the shoggoths developed enough intelligence to rebel against their masters, and now they lurk, patient but potent, in the lightless deeps.

A shoggoth has goals and methods unknowable to humanoid beings. They remember their eons of servitude and, compared to their mysterious masters, humans, elves, dwarves and other intelligent beings are mere specks which crawl upon the surface of the world, indistinguishable from animals. When a shoggoth rolls its immense, hideous body over a band of explorers, engulfing them in a gelatinous press of flesh and gnawing teeth, it is not so much evil as uncaring.

Shoggoths can become the object of worship for humanoid cults dedicated to chaos and entropy. The shoggoth does not respond to this worship, but it can be counted on to consume any hapless victim the cult can capture and sacrifice to it. Rumors of shoggoths that have developed even greater intellects are, one would hope, just that, for the damage a shoggoth capable of reasoning could wreak upon a world is unsettling to say the least.
