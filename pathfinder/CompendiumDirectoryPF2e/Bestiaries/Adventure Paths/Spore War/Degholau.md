Degholaus form from wretched souls who betrayed their societies to evil ends or for personal gain. These fiends resemble bloated, bestial humanoids with eyeless mole-like faces. They have five tails, all of which feature blood-red eyes.

## High Crimes

Those whose souls become degholaus abused positions of authority in their nation for personal gain or simply out of a need for cruelty. They might have sold secrets, weakened institutions, or initiated military action against their own people. Some initially deluded themselves into believing their actions were righteous or victimless, but eventually embraced their destructive role, damaging their soul so completely they transform into these demons after their judgment.
