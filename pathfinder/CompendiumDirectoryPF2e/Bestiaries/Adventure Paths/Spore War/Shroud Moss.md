Shroud mosses are often confused for ghosts, as they appear as a shimmering, insubstantial imprint of a deceased creature. In truth, nothing of the deceased remains within a shroud moss. Rather, what appears to be a ghost is an image created by clouds of shimmering spores surrounding the wispy tendrils of the moss itself. When not disguised by a stolen shape, a shroud moss appears as a mass of gray-green tendrils of moss capable of shifting its shape into the basic framework of a creature, looking not unlike a free-standing humanoid nervous system with a mass of tangles where a brain would be.

## Grayshroud Sufferers

Those who become infected with grayshroud may at first assume they're just suffering from overexertion or lack of sleep, but once they become drained by the disease, their flesh turns increasingly gray and is riddled with flaky sheets as their skin takes on the appearance of peeling bark. Those who die from grayshroud move on to the afterlife as normal, but their remains spawn a new shroud moss who adds their form to its stolen shapes.
