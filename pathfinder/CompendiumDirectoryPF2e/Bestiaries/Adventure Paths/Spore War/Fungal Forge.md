    desc: "`pf2:r` (primal, unholy, void) **Trigger** A sapient living creature enters or is placed inside the fungal forge, a fungal forge takes damage, or an attempt to disable a forge critically fails\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The fungal forge floods its interior with sickly green demonic energy that looks like a mix of fluid and fog. A creature within the fungal forge takes 5d8 variable damage and 5d8 void damage as their soul withers and their flesh decays, while a creature within 20 feet of the forge is exposed to vented unholy energy and only takes the void damage as their flesh rotsâ€”in either case, an affected creature must attempt a `DC 41 Fortitude check` save. The type of non-void damage a fungal forge inflicts on those within varies. The green forge (**D6a**) deals cold damage, the yellow one (**D6b**) poison damage, the orange one (**D6c**) acid damage, the black one (**D6d**) electricity damage, and the purple one (**D6e**) mental damage. Demons and fungi are immune to this effect entirely.\n\n**Green:** 5d8 cold + 5d8 void\n\n**Yellow:** 5d8 poison + 5d8 void\n\n**Orange:** 5d8 acid + 5d8 void\n\n**Black:** 5d8 electricity + 5d8 void\n\n**Purple:** 5d8 mental + 5d8 void\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature takes half damage.\n\n**Failure** The creature takes full damage. If the creature is inside the fungal forge, they also become [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]] and [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] with an unlimited duration.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage. If the creature is inside the fungal forge, they also become [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 2]] and [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] with an unlimited duration."
