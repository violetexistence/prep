Devasances are typically felt before they're seen, as they constantly sap vitality from creatures around them. On the Void, a devasance's aura can be easily confused for a pocket of particularly potent planar energy, especially as they meld into the darkness around them. Legless and incorporeal with glowing red eyes, these vaguely humanoid creatures are commonly confused for shadows, wraiths, or other forms of incorporeal undead.

## Summoned to the Netherworld

Devasances can be found in the Netherworld, where they are sometimes summoned to serve. Their ability to sap light makes them powerful allies between the planes. However, the Netherworld is not always prepared to control their void essence, and devasances rarely understand the concept of planar diplomacy.
