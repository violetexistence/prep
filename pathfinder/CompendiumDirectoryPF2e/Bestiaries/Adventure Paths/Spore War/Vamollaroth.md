  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Swallow Whole|Swallow Whole]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (attack) Hiuge, 4d10+9 bludgeoning, Rupture 60\n* * *\n\nThe monster attempts to swallow a creature of the listed size or smaller that it has grabbed or restrained in its jaws or mouth. If a swallowed creature is of the maximum size listed, the monster can't use Swallow Whole again. If the creature is smaller than the maximum, the monster can usually swallow more creatures; the GM determines the maximum. The monster attempts an `Athletics check` check opposed by the grabbed creature's Reflex DC. If it succeeds, it swallows the creature. The monster's mouth or jaws no longer grab a creature it has swallowed, so the monster is free to use them to Strike or Grab once again. The monster can't attack creatures it has swallowed.\n\nA swallowed creature is [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]], is [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]], and has to hold its breath or start suffocating. The swallowed creature takes the listed amount of damage when first swallowed and at the end of each of its turns while it's swallowed. If the victim [[Actions/Escape|Escapes]] this ability's grabbed condition, it exits through the monster's mouth. This frees any other creature grabbed in the monster's mouth or jaws. A swallowed creature can attack the monster that has swallowed it, but only with unarmed attacks or with weapons of light Bulk or less. The swallowing creature is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] against the attack. If the monster takes piercing or slashing damage equaling or exceeding the listed Rupture value from a single attack or spell, the swallowed creature cuts itself free. A creature that gets free by either Escaping or cutting itself free can immediately breathe and exits the swallowing monster's space.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Engulf and Swallow Whole|Effect: Engulf and Swallow Whole]]\n\nIf the monster dies, a swallowed creature can be freed by creatures adjacent to the corpse if they spend a combined total of 3 actions cutting the monster open with a weapon or unarmed attack that deals piercing or slashing damage."

  - name: "Swamp Stride"
    desc: "  Vamollaroth ignores difficult terrain caused by swamp terrain features."

  - name: "Tongue Grab"
    desc: "  A creature hit by the mobogo's tongue becomes [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] by the mobogo. The creature isn't [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]], but it can't move beyond the reach of the mobogo's tongue.\n\nA creature can sever the tongue with a Strike against AC 43 that deals at least 30 slashing damage. This deals no damage to the mobogo but prevents it from using its tongue Strike until it regrows its tongue, which takes 1 round.\n\nThe mobogo can move without ending the Grab as long as the creature remains within the tongue's reach."

  - name: "Tongue Reposition"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  The mobogo attempts to move a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] by its tongue. The mobogo rolls an `Athletics check` check against the creature's Fortitude DC.\n\nOn a success, the mobogo moves the creature into any space within the tongue's reach. If it wishes, the mobogo can transfer the grabbed creature to its jaws."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Improved Grab|Improved Grab]]"
    desc: "  **Requirements** The monster's last action was a successful Strike that lists Improved Grab in its damage entry, or the monster has a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]\n* * *\n\n**Effect** If used after a Strike, the monster attempts to [[Actions/grapple|grapple]] the creature using the body part it attacked with as a free action. This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead spend an action to use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

Variant mobogo

Mobogos are massive, swamp-dwelling monstrosities that combine the worst aspects of giant toads and evil dragons. Lazy, cruel, and greedy, these vile creatures make their lairs in the most ancient and primordial swamps. The boggards who call such places home worship mobogos as living demigods, regularly bringing sacrifices of food and valuables lest they become the next victims of the mobogos' boundless appetites.
