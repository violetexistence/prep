    desc: "  This monster regains the listed number of Hit Points each round at the beginning of its turn. Its [[Conditions/Dying|Dying]] condition never increases beyond Dying 3 as long as its regeneration is active. However, if it takes damage of a type listed in the regeneration entry, its regeneration deactivates until the end of its next turn. Deactivate the regeneration before applying any damage of a listed type, since that damage might kill the monster by bringing it to Dying 4."

A living creature in the aura must succeed at a `DC 42 Fortitude check` save or become [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] ([[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]] on a critical failure) from the sensation of these spores taking root on their bodies. A creature that's already sickened and fails their save against the aura of spores becomes [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] for 1 round because of excessive fungal growth on their bodies."
