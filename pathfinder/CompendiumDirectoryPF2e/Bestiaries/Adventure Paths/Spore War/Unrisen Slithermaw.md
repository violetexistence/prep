  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Lifesense|Lifesense 30 feet]]"
    desc: "  Lifesense allows a monster to sense the vital essence of living and undead creatures within the listed range. The sense can distinguish between the vitality energy animating living creatures and the void energy animating undead creatures, much as sight distinguishes colors."

  - name: "Meant to Live"
    desc: " (occult) Whenever an unrisen would take damage from vitality energy, it instead heals half that number of Hit Points."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Reactive Strike|Reactive Strike (Special)]]"
    desc: "`pf2:r`  The unrisen Slithermaw gains 12 extra reactions per round beyond its first, which it can only use to make Reactive Strikes. He can't use more than 1 reaction on the same triggering action, even if a creature leaves several squares on the same triggering action.\n\n**Trigger** A creature within the monster's reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The monster attempts a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, the monster disrupts that action. This Strike doesn't count toward the monster's multiple attack penalty, and its multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike."

  - name: "Resurrection Vulnerability"
    desc: "  A creature with a prepared or spontaneous spell that can restore the dead to life (such as [[Spells/Breath of Life|Breath of Life]] or [[Spells/Raise Dead|Raise Dead]]) can expend an appropriate spell slot as a 2-action activity to destroy an unrisen within 30 feet. The attempt fails if the unrisen succeeds at a Will save against the creature's spell DC."

  - name: "Rise Again"
    desc: " (occult) If the unrisen Slithermaw is reduced to 0 Hit Points by means other than fire damage, disintegration, damage caused by a character wearing Slithermaw's Bane, or his resurrection vulnerability, he returns to unlife at the start of his next turn. He has 150 Hit Points and is [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] in the space in which he was destroyed. He can't be returned to unlife by this ability again for 1 hour."

  - name: "Slithermaw's Bane"
    desc: "  If a PC wears _[[Equipment/Slithermaw's Bane|Slithermaw's Bane]]_, the unrisen Slithermaw focuses his attacks on that PC. A PC who wears _Slithermaw's Bane_ is immune to all poison damage caused by the unrisen Slithermaw. Whenever such a PC scores a critical hit on the unrisen Slithermaw, the undead hydra becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]]. The unrisen Slithermaw is not immune to poison inflicted by _Slithermaw's Bane_ when Calistria's Sting is activated and in fact has weakness 15 to this poison damage."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Void Healing|Void Healing]]"
    desc: "  A creature with void healing draws health from void energy rather than vitality energy. It is damaged by vitality damage and is not healed by vitality healing effects. It does not take void damage, and it is healed by void effects that heal undead."

attacks:
  - name: ""

  - name: "**Melee** `pf2:1` Jaws"
    desc: "+34 (deadly d10, magical, unarmed)\n__Damage__  2d6 poison plus *Grab* 3d10 + 17 piercing plus *Grab*"

  - name: "Awful Approach"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  The unrisen reshapes its grotesque form to move swiftly. It Strides twice. Any living creature that can see the unrisen during this movement must succeed at a `DC 37 Fortitude check` save or be [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] ([[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]] on a critical failure). This is a mental and visual effect. The unrisen can't use Awful Approach again for 1d4 rounds."

  - name: "Death Grip"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (curse,occult) **Requirements** The unrisen has a living creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The unrisen attempts to destroy its victim's life force to share the unrisen's fate. The creature must succeed at a `DC 40 Fortitude check` save or become [[Conditions/Doomed|Doomed 1]]. While the curse lasts, the creature regains only half as many HP from vitality healing effects; if it dies, any attempt to raise it from the dead causes it to return as an unrisen. The curse ends automatically if the creature's doomed value is reduced to 0."

  - name: "Poisonous Breath"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (occult,poison) The unrisen Slithermaw breathes out a toxic cloud of foul vapor from its heads in all directions at once. Creatures within a 30-foot emanation take 15d8 poison damage (`DC 40 Fortitude check` save). The unrisen Slithermaw can't use Poisonous Breath again for 1d4 rounds."

  - name: "Storm of Jaws"
    desc: "`pf2:2`  The unrisen Slithermaw makes up to 12 jaws Strikes, each against a different target. These attacks count toward his multiple attack penalty, but the multiple attack penalty doesn't increase until after he makes all of his attacks."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Grab|Grab]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** The monster's last action was a successful Strike that lists Grab in its damage entry, or the monster has a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]\n* * *\n\n**Effect** If used after a Strike, the monster attempts to [[Actions/grapple|grapple]] the creature using the body part it attacked with. This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

Variant unrisen

An unrisen is a mangled conglomeration of splintered bones, decaying organs, and rotting flesh, created when a ritual such as resurrect goes catastrophically wrong. Immense care must be taken, for if the ritual is a critical failure, an unrisen can be the resultâ€”as many a ritualist has learned to their horror.

Unrisen are barely intelligent, aware only of the agony constantly inflicted by their flawed creation and their resentment for the living. They tend to attack the casters involved in the botched ritual first before lashing out at everyone else around them. Though an unrisen's twisted form is unrecognizable as the intended target of the resurrection, its wordless howls are often disturbingly similar to the deceased's voice. If an unrisen is destroyed before it can rise again, it's reduced to a handful of metallic blue-green salts referred to as essential salts.
