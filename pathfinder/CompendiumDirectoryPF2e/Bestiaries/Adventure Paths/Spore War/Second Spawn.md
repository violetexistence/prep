The timber body of a second spawn cracks with each movement, as if its very frame protests its abominable mobility. Grown from arboreals native to the Plane of Wood, the greatest of the second spawn—in effect, the "First Spawn"—is Treerazer's mobile fortress, the Witchbole.

Cleftwood fiends blend the properties of demons and wood elementals, their timber bodies distorted by burls, rot, and fungal growths. Planar scholars have debated into which category cleftwood fiends are better categorized, but to cleftwoods themselves there is no question—they feel much more at home in the Outer Rifts than they do the Plane of Wood.

## Demonic Elementals

Cleftwood fiends aren't true demons or elementals, but they possess both of those creature traits. Since they aren't formed from sinful souls, they lack the typical sin vulnerability most demons possess, and since they possess blood-like sap, they lack the typical immunity to bleed most elementals possess.

## Other Cleftwood Fiends

Rift pulpers and second spawn are the only types of cleftwood fiend currently active in Tanglebriar, but others exist in the Outer Rifts, particularly in the realm of Jeharlu. Here, one might encounter the blood-drinking stump-like splintertooth, the humanoid primal-magic-wielding blighted gardener, or the enormous horror of the fell deadfall.
