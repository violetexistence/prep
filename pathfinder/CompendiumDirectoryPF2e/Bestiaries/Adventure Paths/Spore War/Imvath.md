Some demons embody subtle methods in their pursuit of tempting mortals to fall into sin so that their souls will be damned to the Outer Rifts. Others embrace brutality and devastation and seek instead to ruin mortal lives and accomplishments. The imvath is both, for their whispers encourage mortals to seek not only their own destruction, but also the destruction of their worlds, so the imvath can enjoy the spectacle of extinction. Thankfully rare, imvaths arise from the souls of mortals whose acts came close to, or actually ended, worlds.

An imvath appears as an androgynous, towering, pale humanoid with four red eyes, an oversized mouth filled with fangs, and dozens of blood-red spurs. One arm is muscular, while the other is gaunt. Its legs end in burning hooves, while a lion's tail and bat wings complete its frame.

## Imvath Goals

Whether as generals among demonic armies or as assassins and saboteurs of nations, imvaths know that a world's destruction requires time and dedication. When not actively enjoying planetary devastation, they lend their talents at ruination to those whose work can set a world on just such a path to doom.
