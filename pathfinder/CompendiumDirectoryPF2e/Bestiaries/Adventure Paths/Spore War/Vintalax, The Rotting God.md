    desc: "  Vintalax is driven forward by a singular, otherworldly will, guiding their actions. Whenever Vintalax attempts a Will saving throw against a mental effect that would control or dictate their actions, Vintalax treats the result of the saving throw as one category better."

  - name: "Spore Burst"
    desc: "`pf2:r`  **Trigger** Vintalax takes damage from a melee Strike made by an adjacent creature\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Vintalax's corrupted body unleashes a cloud of spores that envelopes the attacker, quickly growing and dissolving their flesh. These spores deal 4d6 persistent poison damage (`DC 34 Fortitude check` save)."

  - name: "Throne Tethered"
    desc: "  Vintalax is attached to his throne by a twisted length of thorny fungal vines that limit his mobility to areas **B9** and **B10**. This tether can be destroyed (**AC** 30, **Hardness** 12, **HP** 50 (BT 25), **Immunities** acid, bludgeoning; **Resistances** piercing 10), in which case Vintalax howls in pain as his body rapidly begins to decay. Each round that he remains severed from the throne he loses his fast healing and takes 4d6 spirit damage at the start of his turn, but his AC increases to 36 and his speed to 25 feet, due to his increased mobility. He can end this effect by sitting back down on his throne (an Interact action) and remaining there until the end of his turn, at which point a new fungus tether reattaches to him."

These creatures take 2d6 persistent bleed damage as long as they remain sickened. This bleed damage cannot be stopped as long as the sickened condition persists. Any creature that takes damage from spore breath is exposed to rotting gift."

  - name: "Tentacle Eruption"
    desc: "`pf2:2`  Vintalax drives his tentacles into the ground, causing tendrils of fungus to erupt everywhere in area **B9**. This deals 2d8 bludgeoning damage plus 3d6 acid damage to each creature in the area (`DC 34 Reflex check` save). Creatures that fail their save against tentacle eruption are grasped by the tendrils, reducing their speed by 10 feet until the start of Vintalax's next turn (or are [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] on a critical failure)."
