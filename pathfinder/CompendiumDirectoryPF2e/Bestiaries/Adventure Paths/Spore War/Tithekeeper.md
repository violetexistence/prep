The creature's mask becomes an invested item that allows them to see and hear as though peering through the tithekeeper's mask. The creature must use a 3-action activity envisioning the tithekeeper to activate the scrying effect, and the effect can be Dismissed. Multiple creatures can create connections to the tithekeeper's mask simultaneously, and a creature can have connections to multiple tithekeepers with just one mask.

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead spend an action to use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

Razmir's most powerful priests deploy tithekeepers to ensure his followers don't develop sticky fingers. These ziggurat-like constructs have over two dozen legs and a trap-like mouth. At its top, a mask with a colored ribbon attached denotes its symbolic rank in the Church of Razmir.

## Instruments of Terror

Though the tithekeeper's primary function is to collect coins, they're capable of great violence. Priests who determine a village is too far behind on payments might have their tithekeeper skewer multiple residents and wave its victims' bodies in the air as it parades through the streets. Those who survive the ordeal are highly motivated to avoid a repeat experience.
