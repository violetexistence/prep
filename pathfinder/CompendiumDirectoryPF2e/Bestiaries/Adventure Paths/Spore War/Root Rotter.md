Root rotters are all that remain of the unfortunate elven residents of Greengold. Some died in the initial bursts of Jeharlu spores, while others succumbed to infestation by sinmolds. Fungus now riddles their bodies, wrapping around their brains and nerves to reanimate them.

## Corruption Spreaders

A root rotter that remains in place for 24 hours causes a 5-foot emanation to become overgrown with foul-smelling unpleasant fungus. This spread increases by 5 feet for each additional 24 hours the root rotter remains motionless, to a maximum area of a 60-foot emanation after 12 days of motionless lurking. This fungus is permanent as long as it has a source of nourishment but can be destroyed as easily as any patch of mundane fungus.
