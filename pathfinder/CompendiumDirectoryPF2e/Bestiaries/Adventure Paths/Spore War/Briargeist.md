Living creatures hit by a briargeist's infesting seed must attempt a `DC 36 Fortitude check` save with the following effects. A living creature can only host one briarvine at a time; a creature that currently has a briarvine growing out of them after failing a previous saving throw does not need to attempt additional Fortitude saves.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The seed fails to take root.\n\n**Success** The seed fails to take root, but the target still takes 2d10 void damage as the seed dies out.\n\n**Failure** The seed takes root within the target and inflicts 2d10 void damage. At the start of the creature's next turn, a long ghostly thorny vine grows out of their body. This ghostly growth makes a vine Strike (as if the briargeist were making the attack) against a randomly determined ally of the host creature within reach at the start of the host creature's turn. If there's no viable target, the vine inflicts 2d10 void damage (`DC 36 Fortitude check` save) on the host. The host can attempt a new Fortitude save at the end of each of its turns; otherwise, this effect ends automatically after 1 minute.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, except the host can't attempt new Fortitude saves to end the Briarvine early."

Briargeists are verdorites unique to Tanglebriar. Millennia spent steeping in Treerazer's corruptive influence has granted them far greater strength while distorting their forms away from the vaguely humanoid to an animate tangle of thorny vines, roots, and fungal growths.

## About Verdorites

Verdorites are the enraged spectral echoes left behind when an ecosystem experiences a catastrophic collapse. Calling upon the essences of millions of extinguished plants and animals, they punish any they deem responsible for the disaster, as well as whoever might try to harm the lands to which they are bound. Additional verdorites are detailed on pages 164–165 of Pathfinder Book of the Dead.
