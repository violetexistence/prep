When in their true form, miastrileks have a spider-like appearance. However, they prefer humanoid forms when interacting with mortals, posing as rich or influential figures such as nobles, merchants, or leaders of criminal organizations.

## Polluters Of Flesh

Miastrileks are demons associated with pollution and corruption, but unlike the omox (a demon that rises from souls who routinely befouled and polluted their environmental surroundings in life), the miastrilek's sin is more focused on the pollution and corruption of the flesh—such as those who in life ran complex webs of corruption in society that manufactured and distributed drugs that ruined communities, or used pollution and toxins to torture and transform their victims.
