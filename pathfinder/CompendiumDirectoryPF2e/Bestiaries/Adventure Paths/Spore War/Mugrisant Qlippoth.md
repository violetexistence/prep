  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Swallow Whole|Swallow Whole]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (attack) Large, 3d6+14 bludgeoning + 2d6 acid, Rupture 25\n* * *\n\nThe monster attempts to swallow a creature of the listed size or smaller that it has grabbed or restrained in its jaws or mouth. If a swallowed creature is of the maximum size listed, the monster can't use Swallow Whole again. If the creature is smaller than the maximum, the monster can usually swallow more creatures; the GM determines the maximum. The monster attempts an `Athletics check` check opposed by the grabbed creature's Reflex DC. If it succeeds, it swallows the creature. The monster's mouth or jaws no longer grab a creature it has swallowed, so the monster is free to use them to Strike or Grab once again. The monster can't attack creatures it has swallowed.\n\nA swallowed creature is [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]], is [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]], and has to hold its breath or start suffocating. The swallowed creature takes the listed amount of damage when first swallowed and at the end of each of its turns while it's swallowed. If the victim [[Actions/Escape|Escapes]] this ability's grabbed condition, it exits through the monster's mouth. This frees any other creature grabbed in the monster's mouth or jaws. A swallowed creature can attack the monster that has swallowed it, but only with unarmed attacks or with weapons of light Bulk or less. The swallowing creature is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] against the attack. If the monster takes piercing or slashing damage equaling or exceeding the listed Rupture value from a single attack or spell, the swallowed creature cuts itself free. A creature that gets free by either Escaping or cutting itself free can immediately breathe and exits the swallowing monster's space.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Engulf and Swallow Whole|Effect: Engulf and Swallow Whole]]\n\nIf the monster dies, a swallowed creature can be freed by creatures adjacent to the corpse if they spend a combined total of 3 actions cutting the monster open with a weapon or unarmed attack that deals piercing or slashing damage."

  - name: "Teratomatous Display"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (concentrate,emotion,fear,mental,occult,visual) The mugrisant opens their central maw to display a roiling mass of teratomas. The bodies of those who view this revolting sight change of their own accord, sprouting teratomas of their own. Creatures in a 30-foot emanation must attempt a `DC 36 Will check` save, after which they are temporarily immune to further Teratomatous Displays for 1 minute. Tumors created from this ability vanish when the creature isn't sickened.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature takes 3d6 piercing damage and is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]].\n\n**Failure** The creature takes 6d6 piercing damage, is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]], and is [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]].\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature takes 12d6 piercing damage, is sickened 2, and is [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 2]]."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Improved Grab|Improved Grab]]"
    desc: "  **Requirements** The monster's last action was a successful Strike that lists Improved Grab in its damage entry, or the monster has a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]\n* * *\n\n**Effect** If used after a Strike, the monster attempts to [[Actions/grapple|grapple]] the creature using the body part it attacked with as a free action. This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead spend an action to use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

Mugrisants are manifestations of the Outer Rifts' capacity for destructive transformation. This qlippoth's cycle of never-ending transformation gives them an insatiable appetite. While a mugrisant can derive nourishment from any flesh, they need not eat to survive, and favor prey that are strong enough to put up a bit of a fight before being devoured, almost turning their bodies inside out to gulp down creatures nearly as large as they are.

## Constant, Horrific Change

A mugrisant's body is always consuming itself and generating new organs. While a few of these new body parts appear in functional locations, the rest are drawn toward the mugrisant's central growth sac, a composite organ that lies within their largest maw and is used to warp the bodies of those exposed to it. A rare few who are consumed by a mugrisant don't actually die, but are instead transformed body, mind, and soul into a new qlippoth.
