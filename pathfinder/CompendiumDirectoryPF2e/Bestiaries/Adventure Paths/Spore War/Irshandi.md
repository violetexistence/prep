    desc: " (primal) When a siabrae is destroyed, they can attempt a `DC 10 Flat check` (they automatically succeed if they're standing on blighted or diseased terrain, and automatically fail if they're standing on sacred ground). If the flat check succeeds, the siabrae's body crumbles to dust and absorbs into the earth. After 1d10 days, the siabrae's body reforms from a mass of unworked stone large enough to create a new body; this stone is in a random location within 1d10 miles of where the siabrae was destroyed. The siabrae emerges from the stone with a peal of thunder, though without any of their gear."
