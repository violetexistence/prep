    desc: "  After Zuldanavox nearly bit off Zauglagaul's right wing decades ago, it never quite healed right. A crescent-shaped patch of discolored scales at the base of his wing on his right side marks this wound. The PCs might already know about this wound (see Zauglagaul at a Disadvantage below); otherwise, a PC only learns about this weakness if they witness a critical hit against Zauglagaul that inflicts piercing damage. Once a PC knows about Zauglagaul's old wound, they can [[Actions/Seek|Seek]] during their turn to focus on this old wound, automatically treating Zauglagaul as [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the start of their next turn. If a PC critically hits Zauglagaul in the same round they Seek in this way, the pain causes the dragon to become [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]] and [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] for 1 hour. Multiple critical hits can increase the value of these conditions up to a maximum of [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 4]] and [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 4]]."

Variant horned dragon

The magic that flows through primal dragons can manifest more animalistic or bestial features in a given type of dragon. Notably among these are the massive paired horns of the horned dragon. While their bulky frames, natural coloration, and prominent ridged scales are all remarkable in their own way, it's the horns that are most obvious and striking at first glance. Horned dragons use their horns to impale their prey in a quick and brutal display of their might. They are generally contemplative and have a fixation on knowledge and self-discipline, traits belied by their bestial appearance. As a result, horned dragons are generally more open to speaking with outsiders.

Dragons come in myriad forms, with many having magical abilities or connections to magic. Some dragons draw greater power from magic than others, allowing them to manifest abilities or alter their physiques with prolonged exposure to magic. These dragons become more powerful as they age and strengthen their connections with their magical origins. Scholars debate the classification of these dragons, with some preferring the name magical dragons and others using traditional dragons due to their connection to specific magical traditions. Regardless of their names, these dragons share a number of characteristics: their ability to tap into magical energies, intensified might and cunning as they grow older, and an inclination to hoard vast amounts of treasure and wealth.
