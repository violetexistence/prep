Variant gongorinan

While most qlippoths focus on wiping mortals from existence, gongorinans follow the divergent plan of trapping mortals in forms incapable of understanding their actions and performing any sin meriting condemnation to the Outer Rifts. What may seem as a mercy to some is a matter of dire necessity to the gongorinans, who see killing sinful mortals as tantamount to helping their foes.

* * *

Long before the creatures known as demons came to be the dominant force in the Outer Rifts, qlippoth ruled the innumerable cracks of the Outer Sphere. These inimical creatures are a form of primordial and alien evil that predates mortal life, and most immortal life as well. Since the rise of mortal sin and the associated expansion of demonic life through the Outer Rifts, qlippoth have been driven to their deepest reaches, and they seethe with rancor at the loss of their realms. Yet, rather than directly oppose demons, qlippoth instead turn to the source—mortal sin—and wage an endless war to eradicate all creatures capable of sinful acts so that the demonic tide might be turned back. To ensure they do not bolster their foe's ranks, they enact horrific transformations on their targets, converting their victims into beings incapable of discerning right from wrong; this renders them unable to be judged by Pharasma's courts and thus incapable of becoming fiends. Most mortals consider the ministrations of a qlippoth to be far worse than any fate awaiting them in the afterlife.
