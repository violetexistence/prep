    desc: "`pf2:r` (divine, emotion, mental) **Trigger** A round begins after all demons in the spires have been slain\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Aravashnial's distorted face unleashes an overwhelming shriek of agony that threatens to completely warp the thoughts of all intruders. All creatures within 20 feet of a soul pod must succeed at a `DC 36 Will check` save or become [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]] for 1 round (1 minute on a critical failure). A confused creature can attempt a new save at the end of each of their turns to end the confusion early. The soul pods then roll initiative."

  - name: "Routine"
    desc: "(2 actions) The soul pod releases a soulrending shriek on its first action, then on its second action exhales a blast of spore-laden wind in a 40-foot cone. Creatures in this area must attempt a `DC 36 Fortitude check` save. This blast has the air and poison traits.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature takes 4d6 poison damage.\n\n**Failure** The creature takes 8d6 poison damage and is knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] by the wind.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature takes 16d6 poison damage, is knocked prone, and is blown 10 feet backward directly away from the soul pod, possibly being blown off the edge of a platform or stairwell."
