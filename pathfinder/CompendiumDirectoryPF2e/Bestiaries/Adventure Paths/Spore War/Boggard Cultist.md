A creature can sever the tongue by hitting AC 33 and dealing at least 28 slashing damage. Though this doesn't deal any damage to the boggard, it prevents them from using their tongue Strike until they regrow their tongue, which takes a week."

Variant boggard

Boggard warriors exalt single combat and prefer to fight alone so that no one can contest their kills. They have been known to pursue enemies who flee combat with a single-mindedness that seems almost supernatural.

* * *

Boggards are aggressive humanoid amphibians who thrive in swamps, marshes, and even some rain forests. Boggards hatch from eggs into tadpoles, fiercely competing for food and even consuming their siblings in that struggle. Over 3 years, the surviving boggards develop arms, legs, and lungs while learning the rudiments of hunting, crafts, and warfareâ€”everything needed to survive in their might-makes-right society. At the top of most boggard hierarchies lords a hulking swampseer imbued with sinister divine magic.
