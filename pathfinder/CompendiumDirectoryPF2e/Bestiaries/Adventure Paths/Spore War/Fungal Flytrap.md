    desc: "  Tremorsense allows a monster to feel the vibrations through a solid surface caused by movement. It is an imprecise sense with a limited range (listed in the ability). Tremorsense functions only if the monster is on the same surface as the subject, and only if the subject is moving along (or burrowing through) the surface."

It deals no damage on a critical failure. This counts toward the flytrap's multiple attack penalty as a number of attacks equal to the number of leaves the flytrap has."

Variant giant flytrap

Because they blend in so well with surrounding foliage, giant flytraps can use the element of surprise to make quick strikes against unsuspecting adventurers and forest travelers.

Flytraps eagerly feed on humanoids, monstrous insects, and larger prey.
