    desc: "`pf2:r` (divine, emotion, fear, mental) **Trigger** The fungal heart takes damage, or an attempt to disable it fails\n* * *\n\n**Effect** A sinister voice fills the minds of all creatures in area **D1** or **D2**, speaking in Chthonian: \"And so my whelp has failed, yet you have not found salvation—you have doomed Kyonin to fall. Will you be the first to die, or shall you linger long enough to see all you hold dear become mine?\" The PCs immediately recognize this voice as belonging to Treerazer and must attempt a `DC 39 Will check` save or become [[Conditions/Doomed|Doomed 1]] and [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] (or doomed 1, [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 4]], and [[Conditions/Fleeing|Fleeing]] for as long as they remain frightened on a critical failure).

    desc: "(1 action; divine, poison) The fungal heart clenches as if beating like a real heart, then exudes a churning cloud of toxic spores that fills areas **D1** and **D2**. All creatures in these areas take 10d6 poison damage (`DC 34 Fortitude check` save; creatures in area **D1** gain a +4 circumstance bonus to this save due to the diffusion of the spores as they wash into the larger area)."
  - name: "Reset"
    desc: "The fungal heart deactivates and resets if 3 rounds pass during which no attempts to disable or damage it take place. On subsequent activations of \"Treerazer Notices,\" no telepathic message is sent—it's simply an overwhelming sensation of imminent doom."
