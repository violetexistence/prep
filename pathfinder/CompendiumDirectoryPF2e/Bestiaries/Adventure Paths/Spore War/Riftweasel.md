Riftweasels have long, thin tendrils along their snouts that function like whiskers in sensing movement; these grant riftweasels the precise tremorsense to pinpoint delicious grubs and other scavengers while they hide inside of larger corpses.

## Sadistic Scavengers

As a scavenger, the riftweasel is rather intelligent, though it also finds great delight in tormenting creatures. It won't hesitate to arrange victims in unpleasant tableaus, and particularly enjoys feeding on [[Conditions/Paralyzed|Paralyzed]] creatures, eating parts of the body that won't quickly kill. Once a victim dies, they enjoy using talking corpse to mock and interrogate their meals as they finish them. Those subjected to a vision of death by a rift weasel typically see themselves eaten and mocked after death by the cruel creature.
