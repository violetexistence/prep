    desc: " (curse,divine,mental) When Lukarazyll hits a creature with his jaws Strike, the creature becomes infected with the demon's self-loathing. The creature must succeed at a `DC 34 Will check` save to avoid gaining a –1 status penalty to Charisma-based checks. This penalty is cumulative up to –3, and remains even if the wounds are healed. The penalty is reduced by 1 every 24 hours until it reaches 0.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Mutilating Bite|Effect: Mutilating Bite]]"

Creatures in a 15-foot emanation from Lukarazyll take 4d12 bludgeoning damage (`DC 32 Reflex check` save). Those who fail are knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]. In addition, all squares within 15 feet of Lukarazyll become difficult terrain."

  - name: "Spore Burst"
    desc: " (divine,poison) Whenever Lukarazyll picks up debris to throw, tendrils of fungus burrow out from his hands, infesting the debris so that when it hits, it explodes into a cloud of toxic spores. All non-fungus creatures in a 10-foot emanation (including the target) must attempt a `DC 32 Fortitude check` save. The target of the debris takes a –2 circumstance penalty to this save. Those that fail take 2d6 persistent poison damage and are [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]]. Creatures can't remove the sickened condition while this persistent damage remains."

  - name: "Wreck"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  Lukarazyll makes two claw Strikes against an unattended object, wrenching and gouging it while infesting it with tendrils of fungus. If both Strikes hit, combine their damage for the purpose of overcoming its Hardness. These Strikes don't count toward Lukarazyll's multiple attack penalty, nor does that penalty apply to these strikes. If the object is destroyed, Lukarazyll can use it as hurled debris—the remnants automatically become fungus-infested as part of this act and can create a spore burst on a successful hit."

Variant male abrikandilu demon

Wrecker demons, also known as abrikandilus, despise beautiful things and do everything in their power to destroy both people and objects regarded as such. An abrikandilu forms from the souls mortals who were vandals, misanthropes, or defacers of artwork, particularly if their destructive actions stemmed from feelings of powerful envy.

An abrikandilu loathes only one thing more than beauty: their own visage. The mere sight of their face-reflected in a mirror, a shield, or even a pool of water- can send a wrecker demon into a rage. Many demon slayers leverage tactic to their advantage, venturing into battle with polished steel shields and cold iron blades at the ready.

Mortal souls that have been twisted and corrupted by sin sometimes arise in the afterlife as demons. These powerful and destructive fiends seek to spread their particular sin to warp more souls, thereby bolstering their numbers and continuing the cycle.
