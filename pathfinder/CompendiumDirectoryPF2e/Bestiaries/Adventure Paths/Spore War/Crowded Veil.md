    desc: "  A crowded veil is an individual creature that shares one mind with all other crowded veils. What one crowded veil experiences, all experience. If a crowded veil gains any conditions, all other crowded veils know this; they also know the direction to every other crowded veil and the distances between them. A crowded veil can communicate instantly and telepathically with any other crowded veil on the same planet. To crowded veils located on other planets, messages can take up to an hour or more to transmit. A message to a crowded veil on another plane takes 24 hours to transmit. A crowded veil is immune to mental effects that target only a specific number of creatures. If a mental effect targets all creatures in an area, only the crowded veils in that area are affected, although all other crowded veils sense all damage or conditions endured by those crowded veils."

The first time in a round when a creature enters this spore trail, that creature is exposed to crowded veil spores."

Only one crowded veil exists, but it does so as separate entities in many different bodies. As each "individual" member shares a core extraplanar essence with the others, communication between them moves without regard to planar boundaries or the limitations of distance, allowing for swift transmission of information throughout Tanglebriar and beyond.

## The Many are One

A colony of crowded veil hosts appears unlinked to a casual observer. As intelligent, moving fungi, they can stray far from their clonal siblings, yet cannot move beyond regions that support their growth. On Golarion, this limits the crowded veil to Tanglebriar alone.
