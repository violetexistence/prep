Vansidieths rise from the souls of politicians or generals whose pride resulted in great social suffering and tragedy.

## Demonic Generals

While some consider demons to be bickering monsters known more for infighting than uniting in a single army, the story of the Worldwound teaches an important lesson. A powerful demon can organize demonic hordes into an incredibly destructive war machine, and vansidieths often lead those armies as generals, coaxing cooperation from the fiendish rabble.
