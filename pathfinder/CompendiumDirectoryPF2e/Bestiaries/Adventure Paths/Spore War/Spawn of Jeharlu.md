Spawns of Jeharlu typically drift in the skies above the realm of Jeharlu, content to enjoy blasphemous and horrific dreams and fancies while they watch the fungal world below for intruders. It isn't that far off the mark to equate a spawn of Jeharlu to a white blood cell, except in this case the body they defend is Jeharlu. Encountered beyond this realm, a spawn's role reverses—now they play the part of infective agents, seeking to spread corruption through soil, vegetation, and fleshy life wherever they go.

## From Jeharlu Spores

Treerazer uses Jeharlu Spores as his opening gambit against Kyonin in an attempt to spread fungal blights in a sudden and explosive manner. Those same spores, left to germinate in the Outer Rifts, instead develop into spawns of Jeharlu.
