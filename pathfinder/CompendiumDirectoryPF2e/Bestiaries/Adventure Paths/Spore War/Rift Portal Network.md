    desc: "`pf2:r` **Trigger** the mushroom takes damage, any of the seven rifts are touched, or any attempt to disable the network critically fails\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The demonic energies within each of the seven rifts take note, and the cacophonous sound of howling fiends fills the room. All creatures in area **D4** must attempt a `DC 41 Will check` save or become [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]] ([[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] on a critical failure). The hazard then rolls initiative."

    desc: "(7 actions) Each round, each of the seven rifts fires a beam of demonic energy into the room, targeting one creature (regardless of alliance to Tanglebriar) at random. A single creature cannot be targeted by more than one rift beam per round, so if there are fewer than seven potential targets, the rift portal network loses any remaining actions for that round."
  - name: "Reset"
    desc: "The network deactivates and resets if 1 minute passes without any creature moving in area **D4** and without any attempt to disable it."
