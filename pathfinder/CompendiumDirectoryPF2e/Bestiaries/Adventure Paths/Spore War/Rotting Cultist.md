    desc: "`pf2:r`  **Trigger** The rotting cultist is reduced to 0 HP\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The rotting cultist avoids death and reduces their HP to 1. They are [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]], and each time they use this ability, their slowed value increases by 1, up to a maximum of 3. Each time they use this ability, a bloom of fungus erupts from their flesh as their movements become even more disjointed. This slowed condition is reduced by 1 each day. Note that since this is a reaction, any further damage done to a rotting cultist that reduces them to 0 HP before they regain their reactions kills them."

  - name: "Pray to the Rotting God"
    desc: "`pf2:2`  **Frequency** once per day\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The rotting cultist calls out to the Rotting God, offering up their flesh in exchange for power. The rotting cultist is healed 4d6+8 healing HP, gains a +1 status bonus on attack rolls for 1 minute, and they reduce any condition (other than slowed) affecting them by 1 (if they have a numerical value; this has no effect on conditions without values). The rotting cultist becomes [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] for 10 minutes as a fungal bloom erupts from their flesh."
