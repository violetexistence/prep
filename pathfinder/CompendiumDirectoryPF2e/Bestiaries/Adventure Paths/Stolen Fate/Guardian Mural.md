Any other creatures in this area are knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] and pushed out of this squareâ€”those who succeed at a `DC 40 Reflex check` save can choose to be pushed north or south, while those who fail are pushed west, out of the room entirely down a 200-foot fall. These creatures can Grab the Edge with a successful `DC 36 Reflex check` save. The mukradi then rolls initiative but vanishes completely after 1 minute."
