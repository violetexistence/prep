Known also as terror daemons, the horrifying phasmadaemons make use of illusions and their own frightening appearance (that of a serpent with a bony tail, a horned crocodilian skull for a head, and several insectile pincers) to strike fear into the hearts of others. They represent deaths brought about by fright.

## Fearful Machinations

While daemons don't typically require food, phasmadaemons seem intent on feeding on the emotions, and especially the fears, of mortals. Some believe that the life force and emotions of creatures serves as the fuel for a phasmadaemon's magic, while others believe that phasmadaemons simply enjoy facing a mortal eye-to-eye while feeding, delighting in the fear in their prey's final moments.
