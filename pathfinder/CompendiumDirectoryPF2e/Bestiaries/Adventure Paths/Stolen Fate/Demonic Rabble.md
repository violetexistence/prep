    desc: "  Troops are composed of many individuals, represented by four \"segments\" on a battle grid. Each segment is 10 feet on each side and as tall as the individual members of the troop. Segments must remain contiguous. Each one has to share at least 5 feet of one of its edges with another segment—being adjacent on a diagonal isn't sufficient! You can measure flanking, cover, and the like using the center of any segment.\n\nA troop has two Hit Point thresholds in its HP entry and loses segments as it crosses thresholds. Typically, the higher threshold is at 2/3 of the troop's maximum Hit Points and the lower is at 1/3 of its maximum. Once the troop drops below the higher threshold, it loses one segment, leaving three segments (12 squares) remaining and setting the first threshold as the troop's new maximum Hit Points. This repeats when the troop drops below the lower threshold, leaving two segments (8 squares). At 0 Hit Points, the troop disperses entirely, with the few remaining members surrendering, [[Conditions/Fleeing|Fleeing]], or easily dispatched, as determined by the GM. Typically the creature who caused the troop to lose a segment decides which to remove, or the GM decides when a specific creature wasn't responsible. To restore lost segments and maximum Hit Points, a troop needs to spend downtime to use long-term treatment on casualties or recruit new members to replace the fallen.\n\nTroops are typically immune to non-damaging effects that target a single creature, such as a [[Spells/Charm|Charm]] spell or the [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] action. An ability that can target 5 or more creatures can target an entire segment, increasing to two segments if it can target 10 or more creatures and to the entire troop if it can target 20 or more creatures. An ability that affects all creatures in a certain range affects all segments in range (make any checks or saves separately for each segment). As examples, an 8th rank _charm_ spell (with 10 targets) can affect two segments, and an ability that Demoralizes all creatures within 30 feet of you would affect all segments that are fully within that range. A non-damaging ability that would prevent a segment from acting, cause them to flee, or otherwise make them unable to function as part of the troop for a round or more removes the segment entirely. The troop loses a number of HP required to bring it to the next threshold. If an ability both deals damage and has a non-damaging effect, apply the damage then the rest of the effect."

    desc: "`pf2:1` (unholy) **Frequency** once per round\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The throng rips and tears at each enemy within its squares and within 5 feet (`DC 33 Reflex check` save).

  - name: "Demonic Tide"
    desc: "  A demonic rabble is less organized and more vicious than most troops. They can move into other creatures' spaces, and other creatures can move into their spaces. Their spaces are difficult terrain to non-demon creatures. The first time during a turn that a creature hostile to the throng willingly moves into their space, that creature is subjected to the one-action version of Claws, Fangs, and Horns."

  - name: "Hurl Debris"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Frequency** once per round\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The throng hurls debris, creating a 10-foot burst within 30 feet (`DC 25 Reflex check` save). When the throng is reduced to 8 or fewer squares, this area decreases to a 5-foot burst. Damage depends on the number of actions.\n\n`pf2:1` Damage 2d10 bludgeoning damage\n\n`pf2:2` Damage 4d10 bludgeoning damage\n\n`pf2:3` Damage 6d10 bludgeoning damage"

  - name: "Serenity Vulnerability"
    desc: "  A demonic rabble thrives on mayhem, and when members of the throng find themselves facing moments of calm, however brief or temporary, the throng suffers. Whenever the demonic rabble fails a saving throw against an affect that would normally [[Conditions/Fascinated|Fascinate]], [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigue]], [[Conditions/Paralyzed|Paralyze]], [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrain]], or [[Conditions/Slowed|Slow]] at least four creatures, the troop takes 3d6 mental damage."

  - name: "Troop Movement"
    desc: "  Whenever the rabble Strides, they first Form Up as a free action to condense into a 20-foot-by-20-foot area (minus any missing squares), then moves up to their Speed."

The typical demon throng consists of a chaotic mix of less powerful demons—typically abrikandilus, dretches, and quasits, with a few brimoraks, babaus or other, more powerful demons swept up in the mayhem. This tangled mess of different creatures makes coordinated tactics untenable but, while individual demons in the throng might not be able to fully utilize their abilities, the throng itself makes up for these deficiencies with dangerous options of its own.

* * *

Demons are legion. Countless examples crowd the Abyss, many of which have yet to be categorized by mortal scholars. In the Abyss, might very much makes right, and so despite their chaotic nature, weaker demons often gather together to enjoy safety in numbers.

## Throng Abilities

Demon throngs are troops, as defined in Pathfinder Bestiary 3. They have the Troop Defenses, Troop Movement, and Form-Up abilities. They also have the demonic tide ability, which allows them to occupy the same space as other creatures, which is unusual for troops, and Serenity Vulnerability—a result of the troop's demonic nature.
