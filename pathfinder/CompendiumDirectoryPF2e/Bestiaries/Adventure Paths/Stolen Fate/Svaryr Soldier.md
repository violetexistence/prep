Variant einherji

Einherjar are mighty warriors chosen by valkyries from the ranks of those slain in terrible and legendary battles. Forged from the souls of the greatest warriors, the implacable einherjar serve as the foot soldiers of pantheons, skilled in handto-hand combat and slaying giants.

Einherjar often come from warrior cultures, including Ulfen vikings (like the einherji represented in this entry), particularly fierce pirates from the Shackles, and even Osirian conquerors. They can be chosen from wherever war and might hold sway; many deities who hold the call of battle and the pursuit of physical power more sacred than concepts of good and evil might count einherjar warriors and valkyrie choosers of the slain among their chosen servitors. For example, Gorum, Besmara, and Sekhmet have all elevated fallen worshippers as einherjar. Einherjar dedicated to different deities often wield weapons or possess varying cosmetic appearances based on their deity's preferred weapon and their place of death; however, they're universally stalwart, implacable, and efficiently deadly. Einherjar with two-handed weapons or who arise from other backgrounds often have different abilities in place of Jotun Slayer and Instant Repair.
