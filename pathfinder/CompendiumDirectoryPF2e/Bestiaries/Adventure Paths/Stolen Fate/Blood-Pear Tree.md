This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

Variant corpseroot

Corpseroots are rotten, undead trees that grow bright-red poisonous fruit and spread blight to surrounding plants, transforming healthy trees into new corpseroots. These cunning killers drain the life from creatures through their root systems, posing as dead trees until their victims come within reach.

Corpseroots most commonly form from rotten husks of trees that died from supernatural blights, making them common threats in the Fangwood and Fierani forests. The most powerful are ancient trees used as shrines and sacrificial altars, their roots absorbing the blood, flesh, and terror of those condemned under their boughs. Some of these ancient corpseroots still command the respect and devotion of the cults that inadvertently created them.
