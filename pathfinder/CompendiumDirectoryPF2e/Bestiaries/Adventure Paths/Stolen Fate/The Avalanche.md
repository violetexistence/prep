    desc: "Two `DC 41 Athletics check` or `DC 43 Survival check` checks to approach the pedestal, resisting the quaking earth and other hazards and eventually holding strong enough to take the gem from the pedestal; a creature who can approach the pedestal without touching the ground, such as by jumping or flying, can simply snatch the gem and end the Avalanche's assault"

    desc: "`pf2:r` (earth, incapacitation) **Trigger** The PCs reach the area depicted on the Trial of the Avalanche map\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The Avalanche shudders, causing a thunderous boom to fill the area. All creatures without the Earth trait in the area must succeed at a `DC 39 Fortitude check` save or become [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]] ([[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 3]] on a critical failure). The Avalanche then rolls initiative."

    desc: "(1 action) The Avalanche releases its fury at a point within 120 feet, affecting all creatures within its area. Each creature must attempt a `DC 41 Reflex check` save to hold their ground or avoid the incoming danger. The amount and type of damage dealt are based on the nature of the natural disaster the Avalanche unleashes, and certain types of disasters impose additional effects. The Avalanche can't unleash the same type of disaster twice in a row. The sturzstromer is immune to these effects.\n\n**Earthquake** The ground in a 20-foot burst violently shakes and launches rubble in the area, dealing 3d12+20 bludgeoning damage. On a failure, the creature also stumbles back 5 feet, away from the Avalanche. On a critical failure, the creature stumbles back 10 feet and is knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]].\n\n**Fire Rain** A hail of burning rock rains down in a 20-foot burst, dealing 3d12+20 fire damage. Creatures that fail their save catch on fire and take 2d6 persistent fire damage (double on a critical failure).\n\n**Landslide** A mass of rubble falls in a 20-foot burst, dealing 9d8 bludgeoning damage. Creatures that critically fail their save become trapped under this rubble as if it were an avalanche, except a creature can attempt to [[Actions/Escape|Escape]] from beneath the rubble (DC 40).\n\n**Lava Channel** A burst of molten rock violently spews forth in a 30‑foot‑long and 10‑foot‑wide line, dealing 9d8 fire damage. Creatures that fail their Reflex save are swept 15 feet away by the lava (30 feet on a critical failure). The lava cools almost instantly, allowing creatures to walk over its path immediately after resolving the effects of the disaster.\n\n**Powerful Winds** A massive burst of wind travels in a 60-foot line, kicking up dust and dealing 3d12+20 slashing damage. Creatures that fail their Reflex save become [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] for 1 round and also fall prone on a critical failure.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature takes no damage.\n\n**Success** The creature takes half damage.\n\n**Failure** The creature takes full damage.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage."
