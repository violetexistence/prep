Male ghalzarokh

Ghalzarokh demons, also known as tyranny demons, form from the souls of cruel autocrats. These demons subjugate weaker fiends. After amassing an army, a ghalzarokh begins a chaotic spree of bloody conquest.

## Demon Thralls

Ghalzarokhs are bullies who prefer numerous thralls to allies. These demons loathe owing any other being a favor and serve stronger creatures only with the expectation of rich reward. A ghalzarokh can rarely be found without a fiendish entourage or army (such as a demon throng). They prefer "pacts" with "lesser" demons, usually offering only a feeble guarantee to allow the weaker fiend's continued existence.
