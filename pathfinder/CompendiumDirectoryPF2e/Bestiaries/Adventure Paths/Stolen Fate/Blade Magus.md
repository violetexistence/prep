  - name: "Spellstrike"
    desc: "`pf2:2`  The Blade magi channels a spell into a melee Strike to deliver a magically charged attack. The Blade magi casts [[Spells/Acid Splash|Acid Splash]], [[Spells/Ray of Frost|Ray of Frost]], or [[Spells/Vampiric Feast|Vampiric Feast]]. The effects of the spell don't occur immediately but are imbued into the Blade magi's attack instead. The Blade magi makes a melee Strike, which gains the arcane trait. The spell is coupled with the attack, using the Blade magi's attack roll to determine the effects of both the Strike and the spell. This counts as two attacks for their multiple attack penalty, but the penalty isn't applied until after the magus has completed the Spellstrike. After using Spellstrike, the Blade magi can't do so again until they recharge this ability as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. The Blade magi also recharges their Spellstrike when they cast [[Spells/Thunderous Strike|Thunderous Strike]]."
