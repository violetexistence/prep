Legend suggests that Shory mages might have created derhiis as soldiers. Although folklore can be in error, little doubt exists that these flying apes make excellent warriors. History is also clear that derhiis fought countless battles for the Shory Empire, honing their tactical skills and martial traditions. Regardless of whether Shory magic was responsible for the birth of the first derhiis, lore passed down from those times shows the Shory Empire honored their soldiers and treated them as valued allies rather than mere servants.

Derhiis are scarce even in the Mwangi Expanse, where the last of the Shory flying cities, such as Kho and Ulduvai, fell. Still, some dwell among the spires that tower above Shory ruins; these derhii are often quite a bit more powerful than the one detailed below. Other derhiis have spread from the remains of the fallen Shory empire to populate remote highlands and old-growth forests.

Derhiis form small filial groups called troops, centered on one elder derhii and their relations. Several troops might gather into a larger society with a council of troop leaders under one dominant elder. Derhiis are omnivores who favor meat, unlike the terrestrial and largely herbivorous gorillas they resemble. It's possible that this habit developed due to a derhii need for substantial amounts of food coupled with their soldierly ways.

## Derhii Artistry

Derhiis have little use for money, but they're talented crafters. Their goods are practical, beautiful and, when needed, deadly. Shory influences can still be seen in derhii art, including crystalline designs, beadwork, and geometric patterns that hint at the arcane. Derhii leatherwork and metalwork is also top notch, owing to their desire for functional, durable armaments.
