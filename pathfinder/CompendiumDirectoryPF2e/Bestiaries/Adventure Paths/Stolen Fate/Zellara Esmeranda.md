    desc: " (divine) When Zellara is destroyed, she re-forms after 2d4 days at the site of her destruction, fully healed. If she is bound to a harrow deck or harrow card, Zellara can manifest near the bound item instead. Once her ex-student Raven has been defeated, Zellara will return to the Boneyard to face her final judgment."

  - name: "Unbound Fate"
    desc: "  Zellara's connection to the harrow and fortune-telling in life have given her full control of her fate in the afterlife. She can ignore any fortune or misfortune effects that affect her. If she is forced to roll twice as part of a fortune and misfortune effect, she can take whichever die result she prefers, even if the effect would normally force her to choose one of the results."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Void Healing|Void Healing]]"
    desc: "  A creature with void healing draws health from void energy rather than vitality energy. It is damaged by vitality damage and is not healed by vitality healing effects. It does not take void damage, and it is healed by void effects that heal undead."

    desc: "`pf2:3` (occult) **Requirements** Zellara is within 120 feet of a harrow card or harrow deck\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Zellara intentionally binds herself to a harrow card or deck she can sense. While bound in this way, she grants her Stack the Deck ability to anyone carrying the bound card or deck. The trigger and effect for Stack the Deck changes to affect the creature carrying the bound item. She can still Stack the Deck for herself while bound. Zellara can unbind herself from the item as an action, which has the concentrate trait."

    desc: "`pf2:r` (divine,fortune,occult) **Trigger** Zellara is about to attempt a saving throw\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Zellara looks to her immediate future and determines the most favorable outcome for her. She gains a +4 circumstance bonus to the triggering saving throw. If she rolls a critical failure on her saving throw, she can reroll the check, but does so without the bonus."
