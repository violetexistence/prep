Born of the souls of doomsayers and cult leaders who sought to undermine and unravel reality, katpaskirs are demons of nihilism and unmaking.

## Rift Makers

Katpaskirs sense weaknesses in planar fabric. These demons worm their way into spaces between dimensions and break down the barriers. They leave holes aimed at causing chaos and dissolution. In this way, katpaskirs gnaw at reality, hoping to one day unravel it.
