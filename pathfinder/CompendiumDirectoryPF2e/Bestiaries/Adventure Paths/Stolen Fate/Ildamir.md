The suvarden decides on a favorable or an unfavorable outcome. With a favorable outcome, the creature rolls the triggering check a second time and takes the higher result; this is a fortune effect. With an unfavorable outcome, the creature rolls the triggering check a second time and takes the lower result; this is a misfortune effect. Regardless of the outcome, the triggering creature becomes immune to Reweave Fate for 1 day."

  - name: "Web of Fate"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (primal) The suvarden creates a web spun from the threads of fate in a 10-foot burst within 30 feet. The squares filled with the web are difficult terrain. Each square can be cleared of the web by a single attack or effect that deals at least 5 slashing damage or 1 fire damage. A square has AC 5, and it automatically fails its saving throws. Each time a creature in the web begins to use a move action or enters the web during a move action, it must attempt a `DC 42 Will check` save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected and doesn't need to attempt further saving throws against the web.\n\n**Success** The creature is momentarily baffled by glimpses of possible futures and is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] for 1 round.\n\n**Failure** Possibilities spun throughout the web overwhelm the creature. It becomes [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]] for 1 round.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the duration is 1 minute and the creature is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] while it's confused."

While the Material Plane and the Dimension of Time remain distinct realities, the two share a powerful connection. Suvardens are living embodiments of this connection.

## A Matter Of Time

Suvardens have a connection to the Dimension of Time, but exist more as natives of the Material Plane. As a result, they do not possess the Time trait. Suvardens refuse to elaborate on their place within existence and time. A suvarden first tries to maintain the order of cause and effect with its guidance, but when that fails, more powerful or cruel creatures increasingly get involved. Most agree that meeting a suvarden is preferable to encountering a hound of Tindalos or siktempora, although there certainly exist powerful suvardens as well.
