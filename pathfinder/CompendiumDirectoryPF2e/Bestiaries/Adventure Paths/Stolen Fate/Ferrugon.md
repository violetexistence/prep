    desc: "`pf2:r` (divine,linguistic,mental) **Trigger** A non-devil creature within 30 feet of the ferrugon succeeds (but doesn't critically succeed) at an attack roll, skill check, or saving throw\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The ferrugon whispers subversive messages to the triggering creature, causing it to become overly confident in its abilities, while in fact it becomes less accomplished overall. The target must attempt a `DC 32 Will check` save. On a failure, the target gains a +2 status bonus to saving throws against fear effects but also takes a –2 penalty to all attack rolls and skill checks for 1 hour. During this time, the victim can't benefit from [[Actions/Aid|Aid]] reactions, use healing effects on themselves, or use [[Actions/Take Cover|Take Cover]] or Raise a Shield actions, as these actions seem unnecessary to the creature at this time. Similar defensive actions might not be available to the victim as well, at the GM's discretion. The target is then temporarily immune to Vainglorious Whispers for 24 hours."
