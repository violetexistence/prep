    desc: "`pf2:r` **Trigger** The PCs arrive at the island\n* * *\n\n**Effect** A fiery point of light appears in the sky at the center of the Eclipse, swiftly growing in size as it becomes apparent that a meteor is hurtling toward the island. The Eclipse rolls initiative."

    desc: "(1 action) The Eclipse heals 50 healing points of damage, retreats upward from PCs if any have approached (as determined by its Distance Score), then unleashes a meteor down on the island below. The meteor explodes upon striking the island, creating a 30-foot burst that inflicts 8d6 fire damage and 4d6 bludgeoning damage (`DC 41 Reflex check` save) to all creatures caught in the blast. The eclipse targets these strikes to catch as many PCs in the blast as it can each time—while it doesn't seek to damage a bul‑gae, it won't worry about catching one or both in the area of effect if that spot is the most advantageous to striking the most possible PCs."
