If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, the monster disrupts that action. This Strike doesn't count toward the monster's multiple attack penalty, and its multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike."

  - name: "Meditative Therapy"
    desc: " (healing) **Frequency** once per day\n* * *\n\n**Effect** One of Usilket's most unusual abilities is a technique they learned during a long visit to Jalmeray. Usilket enters a trancelike state for 10 minutes, during which they can attempt to remove a disease or one of the following conditions: [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy]], [[Conditions/Drained|Drained]], [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled]], or [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied]]. To remove the disease or condition, Usilket must counteract the disease or condition with a Medicine check. Usilket can attempt to counteract a disease or condition present in another creature, as long as that creature remains adjacent to the witchwyrd during the entire meditation."

  - name: "Powerful Fists"
    desc: "  Usilket's fist Strikes are treated as cold iron and silver and don't take penalties when making lethal attacks."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Grab|Grab]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** The monster's last action was a successful Strike that lists Grab in its damage entry, or the monster has a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]\n* * *\n\n**Effect** If used after a Strike, the monster attempts to [[Actions/grapple|grapple]] the creature using the body part it attacked with. This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."
