Variant aluum

The most common aluum is powered by the bound soul of a loyal city servant, but its creation is among the Pactmasters' most guarded secrets. There are dozens of dormant aluums spread throughout Katapesh, and only someone wearing an aluum charm can activate and command one of these 14-foot-tall soldiers. The Pactmasters entrust few beyond the Zephyr Guard to carry these charms, and stealing such a charm is one of the most severe crimes in the city.

* * *

Aluums are powerful metal and stone constructs originally created by the Pactmasters to maintain order in Katapesh. The construction of each aluum includes the creation of an _[[Equipment/Aluum Charm|Aluum Charm]]_, a brass pendant set with a blue crystal designed to control that particular construct. The charm constructed at the same time as an aluum is called its linked charm.
