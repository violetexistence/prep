    desc: "`pf2:r` (divine, incapacitation, mental, visual) **Trigger** A creature who can see the Smith's skull approaches within 20 feet\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The skull's eyes flare. Each non-storykin creature within 60 feet who can see the skull is subjected to an overwhelming feeling of being sucked into it, and must attempt a `DC 40 Will check` save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature feels pain across its body, as if the skull's inhalation were pulling the skin from its bones. The creature becomes [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] and takes 8d6 mental damage.\n\n**Failure** The creature is convinced that the skull just \"breathed in\" its skin, and it takes 16d6 mental damage. The overwhelming pain leaves the creature [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] for 1 round as well.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but 24d6 mental damage and the creature is [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 3]] from the pain."
