On a failure, the trap triggers as the character steps on a pressure plate—the trap automatically triggers if a creature steps on either square just west of the hallway leading to **H12**\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The trap makes a crystal spike Strike against all creatures in the room, then each creature in the room takes 6d10 piercing damage as the spikes explode (`DC 36 Reflex check`)."
