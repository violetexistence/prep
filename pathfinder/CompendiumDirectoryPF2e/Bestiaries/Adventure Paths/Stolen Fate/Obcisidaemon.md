Destroying the daemon frees the souls, though this doesn't return the deceased creatures to life.

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

Obcisidaemons (known to some as obliteration daemons) care only for the brutality and violence that conflict brings.

## Soul Hoarding

Obcisidaemons carry some souls for months or even years at a time, choosing never to consume them, even when doing so might grant an advantage in combat.
