The longer criminals hold on to stolen loot, the greater the chance they will get caught. Fences make themselves indispensable in the underworld by paying for stolen goods in order to resell them later, whether through a seemingly legitimate business or to a closed group of elite buyers.

Some criminals are the desperate who have no option but to break the law to survive, while others choose a life of crime for thrills, forming gangs or underworld guilds that specialize in certain illegal ventures.
