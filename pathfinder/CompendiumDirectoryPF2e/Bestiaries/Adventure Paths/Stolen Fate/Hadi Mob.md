    desc: "  Troops are composed of many individuals, represented by four \"segments\" on a battle grid. Each segment is 10 feet on each side and as tall as the individual members of the troop. Segments must remain contiguous. Each one has to share at least 5 feet of one of its edges with another segmentâ€”being adjacent on a diagonal isn't sufficient! You can measure flanking, cover, and the like using the center of any segment.\n\nA troop has two Hit Point thresholds in its HP entry and loses segments as it crosses thresholds. Typically, the higher threshold is at 2/3 of the troop's maximum Hit Points and the lower is at 1/3 of its maximum. Once the troop drops below the higher threshold, it loses one segment, leaving three segments (12 squares) remaining and setting the first threshold as the troop's new maximum Hit Points. This repeats when the troop drops below the lower threshold, leaving two segments (8 squares). At 0 Hit Points, the troop disperses entirely, with the few remaining members surrendering, [[Conditions/Fleeing|Fleeing]], or easily dispatched, as determined by the GM. Typically the creature who caused the troop to lose a segment decides which to remove, or the GM decides when a specific creature wasn't responsible. To restore lost segments and maximum Hit Points, a troop needs to spend downtime to use long-term treatment on casualties or recruit new members to replace the fallen.\n\nTroops are typically immune to non-damaging effects that target a single creature, such as a [[Spells/Charm|Charm]] spell or the [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] action. An ability that can target 5 or more creatures can target an entire segment, increasing to two segments if it can target 10 or more creatures and to the entire troop if it can target 20 or more creatures. An ability that affects all creatures in a certain range affects all segments in range (make any checks or saves separately for each segment). As examples, an 8th rank _charm_ spell (with 10 targets) can affect two segments, and an ability that Demoralizes all creatures within 30 feet of you would affect all segments that are fully within that range. A non-damaging ability that would prevent a segment from acting, cause them to flee, or otherwise make them unable to function as part of the troop for a round or more removes the segment entirely. The troop loses a number of HP required to bring it to the next threshold. If an ability both deals damage and has a non-damaging effect, apply the damage then the rest of the effect."

The character loses previous ancestry feats, selecting replacements from the ratfolk ancestry."

    desc: "  Whenever the hadi mob Strides, they first Form Up as a free action to condense into a 20-foot-by-20-foot area (minus any missing squares), then moves up to their Speed. This works just like a Gargantuan creature moving; for instance, if any square of the troop enters difficult terrain, the extra movement cost applies to the whole troop."

aemons, including leukodaemons, once ruled over part of the fallen city of Kho. While they did, they created the first hadis.

Hadis look more fiendish and sinister than typical ratfolk. In hadi society, those who foster and cultivate blights and sickness are alchemists known as "tafens". Others, known as "rajwans," focus their training on brutal combat and barbarian rages.

Individually, most hadis are no match for a high level group, but when confronted in their lair, they can gather together into a dangerous mob.

## Hadi Evil

Although the original hadis created by daemons in ages past were ascended from rats infused with fiendish qualities that tempered their sapience with an engineered evil, over the generations the hadi people have formed their own society. They cling to evil ways largely out of tradition or fear, but there are an increasing number of hadis who admire Kho's derhiis and seek their own paths. Others, particularly those who have traveled far from Kho, have come to understand the plight of their folk under the weight of a fiendish past. Non-evil hadi thus exist, but they are viewed by those in positions of power in Kho as dangers to the social order. These hadi do not carry the pestilence their more sinister kin do and many actively work to suppress the spread of illnesses.
