The creature must attempt a `DC 37 Will check` save, and the shadow maze then rolls initiative.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature sees through the illusions and can move freely through squares within the shadow maze's effect. It's temporarily immune to the effects of the trap's routine for 1 minute.\n\n**Success** The creature understands that what it's experiencing is an illusion, but it isn't immune to the effects of the trap's routine.\n\n**Failure** The creature believes it has stepped into a vast maze. To those observing the creature outside of the shadow maze, the creature remains motionless. The creature becomes [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 2]] for 1 round, during which time all of its speeds are reduced to 5 feet.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature not only believes it has entered a vast maze, but is overwhelmed with the sensation of being hopelessly lost. The creature is [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] until the end of its next turn."

  - name: "Routine"
    desc: "(1 action; illusion, incapacitation, mental) The shadow maze shifts and adjusts its appearance, affecting all creatures currently located within its area. Any creatures in the area at this time must attempt a `DC 37 Will check` save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature sees through the illusions and can act normally.\n\n**Success** The creature treats all squares within the trap's area as difficult terrain, and the trap fills the creature's mind with sensations and false memories that it has been wandering these alleys for nearly an hour. The creature takes 5d6 mental damage from the perceived strain of navigating the alien flooded alleys.\n\n**Failure** As success, but the creature believes it has been wandering the alleys for several hours. It becomes [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 2]] for 1 round and takes 10d6 mental damage from the perceived strain.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature believes it has been hopelessly lost in the alleys of the shadow maze for days, and it is incapacitated for 1 round and takes 20d6 mental damage from the perceived strain."
