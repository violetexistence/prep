The vines cease growing after 10 rounds, and they wither away in 1d4 days if not shaved off before then. The vines can be destroyed if the creature is affected by a good spell or if holy water is applied to the vines (with an Interact action)."

  - name: "[[Compendium.pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Item.RJbI07QSiYp0SF9A|Troop Defenses]]"
    desc: "  Troops are composed of many individuals, represented by four \"segments\" on a battle grid. Each segment is 10 feet on each side and as tall as the individual members of the troop. Segments must remain contiguous. Each one has to share at least 5 feet of one of its edges with another segment—being adjacent on a diagonal isn't sufficient! You can measure flanking, cover, and the like using the center of any segment.\n\nA troop has two Hit Point thresholds in its HP entry and loses segments as it crosses thresholds. Typically, the higher threshold is at 2/3 of the troop's maximum Hit Points and the lower is at 1/3 of its maximum. Once the troop drops below the higher threshold, it loses one segment, leaving three segments (12 squares) remaining and setting the first threshold as the troop's new maximum Hit Points. This repeats when the troop drops below the lower threshold, leaving two segments (8 squares). At 0 Hit Points, the troop disperses entirely, with the few remaining members surrendering, [[Conditions/Fleeing|Fleeing]], or easily dispatched, as determined by the GM. Typically the creature who caused the troop to lose a segment decides which to remove, or the GM decides when a specific creature wasn't responsible. To restore lost segments and maximum Hit Points, a troop needs to spend downtime to use long-term treatment on casualties or recruit new members to replace the fallen.\n\nTroops are typically immune to non-damaging effects that target a single creature, such as a [[Spells/Charm|Charm]] spell or the [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] action. An ability that can target 5 or more creatures can target an entire segment, increasing to two segments if it can target 10 or more creatures and to the entire troop if it can target 20 or more creatures. An ability that affects all creatures in a certain range affects all segments in range (make any checks or saves separately for each segment). As examples, an 8th rank _charm_ spell (with 10 targets) can affect two segments, and an ability that Demoralizes all creatures within 30 feet of you would affect all segments that are fully within that range. A non-damaging ability that would prevent a segment from acting, cause them to flee, or otherwise make them unable to function as part of the troop for a round or more removes the segment entirely. The troop loses a number of HP required to bring it to the next threshold. If an ability both deals damage and has a non-damaging effect, apply the damage then the rest of the effect."

Wrath demons are among the most well-known and feared of the Abyss's fiends, but sometimes a wrath demon becomes stunted in size as the result of too many failed rampages, a punishment inflicted by an angry demonic commander or simple ill fortune. These smaller wrath demons, not much larger than humans, are typically slaughtered quickly by their larger kin, but rarely a group of undersized vrocks can gather in numbers large enough to form a wrath riot.

* * *

Demons are legion. Countless examples crowd the Abyss, many of which have yet to be categorized by mortal scholars. In the Abyss, might very much makes right, and so despite their chaotic nature, weaker demons often gather together to enjoy safety in numbers.

## Throng Abilities

Demon throngs are troops, as defined in Pathfinder Bestiary 3. They have the Troop Defenses, Troop Movement, and Form-Up abilities. They also have the demonic tide ability, which allows them to occupy the same space as other creatures, which is unusual for troops, and Serenity Vulnerability—a result of the troop's demonic nature.

## Other Throngs

Wrath riots form because vrocks have an intrinsic quality of cooperation in their dance of ruin, but other types of demons might form into throngs as well. The more notorious forms of demon throngs found in the various tales and historical records include demonic press gangs of babaus, who abduct hapless victims to serve on nightmarish ships, and firestorms of brimoraks, who caper and swoop above eldritch volcanoes.
