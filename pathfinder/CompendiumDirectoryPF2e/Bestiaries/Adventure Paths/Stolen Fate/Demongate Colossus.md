    desc: "  The Demongate Colossus is built around a seething, churning mass of Abyssal energy that looks like a sphere of electrified red mist encompassing a single floating harrow card at its center—The Survivor. The Abyssal link is obscured until the Demongate Colossus is reduced to fewer than 120 Hit Points, at which point glimpses of it become visible through tears and holes in its leathery \"flesh.\" The potent magic drawn from this card, combined with the radiant warden's gatewarper aura, is what allowed the Prince of Wolves to invade Harrow Court. Once the Abyssal link is revealed, a character can attempt to counter the Abyssal link with a [[Spells/Dispel Magic|Dispel Magic]] (7th rank; counteract DC 34), or can attempt to [[Actions/Steal|Steal]] the card with a `DC 35 Thievery check` (master) check (on a failure, a thief attempting to Steal the card takes 5d10 chaotic and 5d10 evil damage—this damage is doubled on a critical failure). Either success causes a link collapse."

  - name: "Link Collapse"
    desc: "  If the Demongate Colossus is destroyed or its belly portal is deactivated, demons that used the colossus's portal within a 40-foot emanation take 7d10 spirit damage (`DC 30 Fortitude check` save). A creature that takes full or double damage is [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 2]] for 1 minute. If the Demongate Colossus is still active when it suffers a link collapse, it becomes [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 3]] and loses its gatewarper aura."

On a critical failure, the creature is also [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 2]]."

Variant radiant warden

The enigmatic and strange radiant wardens were constructed thousands of years ago to protect observatories and scholars against the incursion of alien aggressors from the Dominion of the Black. Over time, their roles as guardians expanded to include watching over any region where the laws of time and space have worn thin, particularly near portals and permanent gates between planets, planes, or dimensions.

Named for both the radial nature of the concentric rings that make up their bodies as well as the glowing radiance of their attacks, radiant wardens carry on their orders, defending sites from invasion with single-minded purpose.
