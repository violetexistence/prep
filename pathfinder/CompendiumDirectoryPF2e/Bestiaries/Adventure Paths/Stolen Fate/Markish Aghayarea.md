If a creature is slain by this ability, the creature's soul becomes trapped within Markish. While its soul is trapped, a creature can't be resurrected except by powerful magic such as a [[Spells/Wish|Wish]] spell. Destroying Markish or successfully counteracting Devour Soul (see Spell Deflection) releases the soul. Markish can hold only one soul at a time. A soul has 5 soul charges per level of the originating creature (see Soul Spells). The devourer can expend these charges to cast spells. If the soul is freed and the creature returns to life, the creature is [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]] for every 5 soul charges expended. If reduced to 0 soul charges, the soul is consumed and can be restored to life only by wish or similar magic."

Male marid devourer

When fiends and powerful evil spellcasters are lost beyond the farthest reaches of the multiverse, they sometimes return as horrific undead called devourers that consume the souls of the living to fuel their arcane machinations. Their bodies are ruined and rebuilt, hollow and twisted, even as their minds undergo a spiritual transformation. They gain the ability to bind other souls to their own and drain their essence for magical power, yet can never be sated in their pursuit of it. Seething masses of distorted ghostly shapes surge within their hollow rib cages-manifestations of the devourers' most recently consumed souls.
