    desc: "(2 actions) The sound of something immense striding just out of sight through the forest, darkness, and fog fills the air. The haunt's first action is to unleash a Terrifying Roar (`DC 22 Will check` with the same effects as Terrifying Roar above). The second action is to infuse the trees of the entire mindscape with malevolent life, causing clawlike branches to lash out at each PC. These claws inflict 4d6 slashing damage (`DC 22 Reflex check` save) to each character. A character standing on the path or in a clearing gets a +1 circumstance bonus to this saving throw, and the character who carries Sui-Jing's heart gains a +4 item bonus to this saving throw. On a PC's turn, they can take further action to protect themselves from the clawed branches. By Raising a Shield or by Dropping Prone, a PC gains a +2 circumstance bonus to their Reflex saving throw. A [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] PC can [[Actions/Take Cover|Take Cover]] to gain the benefits of greater cover against the claws (increasing their circumstance bonus to this Reflex save to +4). A PC who Tumbles Through on their turn and succeeds at a `DC 22 Acrobatics check` check gains a +2 status bonus to their Reflex saves against the clawed branches. A PC who succeeds at a `DC 22 Stealth check` check to [[Actions/Sneak|Sneak]] improves the result of their Reflex save by one degree of success.\n\nIf a PC successfully used Nature or Religion to pray against the evil on the previous round, Kugaptee's Anger has only 1 action; randomly determine if it uses its Terrifying Roar or lashes out with trees with this action."
