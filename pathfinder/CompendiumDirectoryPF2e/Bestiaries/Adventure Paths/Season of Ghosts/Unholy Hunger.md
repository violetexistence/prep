The triggering creature instead must attempt a `DC 24 Will check` save to resist the compulsion to dip their face into the stew and swallow a mouthful of the stuff (this effect has the enchantment and mental traits). On a failure, the triggering creature takes 5d6 poison damage (`DC 24 Fortitude check` save)."
