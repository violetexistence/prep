    desc: " (aura,magical,mental) A monster with telepathy can communicate mentally with any creatures within the listed radius, as long as they share a language. This doesn't give any special access to their thoughts, and communicates no more information than normal speech would."

  - name: "No Face"
    desc: "  The noppera-bo has no sense of vision, but their hearing is precise. They don't breathe and are immune to effects that require breathing. They gain sustenance by absorbing fluids through their skinâ€”traditionally by immersing their hands or faceless head into the fluid to \"drink\" through osmosis; they can also benefit from consumables, such as potions or elixirs, in this way."

  - name: "False Weapon"
    desc: "  A noppera-bo impersonator carries a _+1 striking_ weapon that looks identical to the favored weapon of the PC being impersonated. If the PC favors unarmed strikes, it appears as hand wraps. If the PC favors a ranged weapon, then the noppera-bo impersonator has no melee weapon and instead uses the ranged weapon rules above; otherwise, the noppera-bo impersonator has no ranged weapon. If the PCs favors no weapon, then the noppera-bo wields a club as its false weapon. This false weapon is only partially real and inflicts only mental damage when it hits; it gains none of the original weapon's traits or magical enhancements. If a noppera-bo impersonator's false weapon is broken, disarmed, or set down, it fades away. The noppera-bo impersonator can craft a replacement false weapon by spending 10 minutes to recreate one."

  - name: "Impersonated Spellcasting"
    desc: "  The noppera-bo impersonator gains a suites of innate spells, matching the spellcasting tradition utilized by the PC being impersonated. You can adjust the spells to make a more perfect fit for the impersonation."
