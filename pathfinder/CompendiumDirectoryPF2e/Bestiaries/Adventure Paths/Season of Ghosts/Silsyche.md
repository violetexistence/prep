    desc: " (divine) The silsyche inhabits a modest building and controls it. While the building is possessed, its decor shifts to reflect the silsyche's mood, such as being filled with bright light (when the silsyche is happy) or appearing old and filthy (if they're depressed). A silsyche can't willingly leave their home; if forced out of their home, the silsyche takes 3d10 force damage (`DC 25 Fortitude check` save) at the start of each of their turns."

When a home is abandoned after it has been lived in for generations, sometimes the building itself mourns the loss of its family so greatly that it attracts the pity of a kami who has yet to claim a ward. Similar to how a tsukumogami manifests, such a conjoining of spiritual power can result in the formation of a silsycheâ€”a spirit of an abandoned home who craves companionship. A silsyche never aims to outright harm those who enter the homes they form from. They are merely desperate for connection and lack the understanding that most others don't take kindly to captivity.

The silsyche's true form is a slender, childlike shimmering figure with a headpiece resembling the structure they initially manifested from. These representations of the silsyche's first home reflect the warmth and welcome they yearn for, potentially even displaying mementos of the house's inhabitants that have long gone.

## Range Of Possession

Most silsyches bond with a single home, typically a small building with one or two floors. More powerful silsyches can bond with larger structures, like fortresses or castles, or even large vehicles like sailing ships. Legends of entire towns being claimed by a single, incredibly powerful silsyche persist in stories to this day.
