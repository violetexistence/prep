Shimmerthieves are blind, lizard-like cave dwellers with an insatiable yearning to consume the rare delicacy of light. This hunger compels them to travel beyond their subterranean lairs to the surface to feed, leaving pockets of darkness behind as they go.

They're far from unintelligent yet prefer to avoid other sapient creatures, aware that many find them off-putting. They become independent at a young age but are protective of their kind, and they travel in small groups when able. Prudent shimmerthieves try to avoid feeding on light in busy areas, but such places are also the most tempting, as bustling populations mean more light sources.

## Alternate Diets

Some shimmerthieves develop a taste for and the capacity to consume energy forms far more insidious than light, allowing them to feed on life energy or thought energy instead of light. Such behavior is considered monstrous by most shimmerthieves and a reason for exile. Shimmerthieves with these proclivities are dangerous predators that maintain the ability to feed on light and purposely create pockets of darkness to trap and feed on victims. A shimmerthief that feeds on life energy deals negative damage with their jaws, while one that feeds on thought energy deals mental damage with their jaws.
