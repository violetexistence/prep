A dalgyal gwishin is a faceless, undead spirit that wears a stone mask. This forlorn undead forms from the soul of a mortal who died a lonely death with no one to remember them, and is similarly unable to remember what it looked like in life. A dalgyal gwishin wanders the land of the living in search of any trace of who they were when they were alive. Full of anger, they remain envious of well-loved or famous individuals who are surrounded by close friends and admirers—the type of people who would never share the dalgyal gwishin's fate.

While a dalgyal gwishin has little more than a ghostly body made of mist, the featureless stone mask it wears on its head is solid. Even the stolen faces it claims are transitory, cracking off after a day to form what looks akin to a fragile porcelain death mask. Some of these lonely spirits keep these masks and add them to a collection in a remote and forlorn lair, hoping to find companionship in an ever-growing display of silent faces.

## Faceless Horror

The dalgyal gwishin's most significant physical trait—the lack of a face—is shared with the living aberrations known as noppera-bos. Despite this shared feature and the ability to steal faces, the two creatures don't cooperate and are more often bitter enemies. Anyone slain by a dalgyal gwishin leaves behind an unnerving faceless corpse.
