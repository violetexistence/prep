    desc: " (exploration) **Frequency** once per day\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Granny Hu can shift a PC's reputation in Willowshore over the course of 2 hours of work. She attempts a Deception check against the target's Deception, Diplomacy, or Intimidation DC, whichever is highest. If the target is admired or revered by at least one faction in Willowshore, Granny Hu takes a –1 status penalty to her check, or –2 if the target is admired or revered by both factions. The target is then temporarily immune to So Have You Heard? for 1 week.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target takes a –2 circumstance penalty to Charisma-based skill checks when interacting with Willowshore residents for a week.\n\n**Success** As critical success, but only a –1 circumstance penalty and for only 1 day.\n\n**Failure** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Critical Failure** The plan backfires; not only is the target unaffected, but Granny Hu can't use So Have You Heard? for 1 month."
