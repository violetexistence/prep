Worshippers in Shenmen who devote their every breath to Pharasma only to defy the goddess with their last sometimes transform, upon death, into path maidens. The garments all path maidens wear are the last vestiges of their former faith, a permanent reminder of their disgrace.

## Path Nomads

Path maidens almost always manifest in feminine forms. Those who manifest in masculine forms are instead known as path nomads. These undead have the same abilities but tend to travel more widely; they represent turning one's back on Pharasma's role as a prophet and manipulator of destiny than of her roles over birth and death.
