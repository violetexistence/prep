    desc: "`pf2:2` (divine,fire) The exorcist attempts to Strike a creature with their torch, attacking with great precision and causing the torch's fires to flare up. This Strike gains a +2 status bonus to its attack roll and inflicts an additional 2d6 fire damage on a hit instead of just 1d6 fire damage. An undead, spirit, or transmigrated creature hit by this attack must also attempt a `DC 26 Will check` save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected by this additional effect, and some of the fire flares back onto the exorcist, inflicting 2d6 fire damage to the exorcist (`DC 26 Reflex check` save).\n\n**Success** The creature is unaffected by this additional effect.\n\n**Failure** The purifying flames cause the creature to become [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] and [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] until the end of its next turn.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 2]] and [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] for 1 minute."
