Most nindorus are harmed by silver, but not the argyrzei. Instead, argyrzeis use silver as a method of spreading sickness and pain, and to help them manipulate the minds of those who unwittingly fall under the curse of their infected gifts. They delight in disguising themselves and then selling or giving infected silver to victims. Other nindorus particularly fear argyrzeis for their mastery over silver, knowing that they're capable of causing painful wounds with their silver blades.

Argyrzeis appear humanoid, but their feet point backwards and they have no heads. Their glowing red neck stumps are stuffed with a wide assortment of knives, blades, and shards of metal. These nindorus represent the cycle of art being created, destroyed, and recycled into new art.
