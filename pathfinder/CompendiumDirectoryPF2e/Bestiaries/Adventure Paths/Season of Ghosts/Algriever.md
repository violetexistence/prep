Some mistake these spiderlike spirits as scavengers looking to loot abandoned shrines, but they're actually the opposite: self-appointed guardians of forgotten places of worship, defending the sanctity of discarded faiths and tending sites that have no caretakers. Sometimes, an algriever's duties are tinged with sadness and grief, as they mourn the loss of those who once attended their chosen shrine. Others are filled with frustration and rage, viewing any who stumble upon their shrine as lapsed faithful at best or blasphemers at worseâ€”sinners who deserve punishment.

Algrievers have little interest in living creatures until they wander into their territory. Once an algriever's shrine has been breached, they block passage until the interlopers pay their respects. Aggressive algrievers steal from travelers or take hostages until their demands for an offering are satisfied. When algrievers suspect someone of committing blasphemy, no gifts can slake their thirst for vengeance.

## Reactive Punishment

An algriever follows the edicts and anathemas of the deity or faith of the shrine to which they're bonded, although they remain neutral in alignment. Regardless of how large the shrine is, an algriever chooses three Medium or smaller objects in the shrine as their own focus for defense, and can use Acolyte's Defense against any creature that touches or disturbs those objects.
