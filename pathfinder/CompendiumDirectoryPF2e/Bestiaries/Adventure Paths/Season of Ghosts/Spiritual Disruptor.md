    desc: "(three actions) The spiritual disruptor's first action each round is always to create a pulse of rippling energy in a 10-foot emanation that causes the surrounding structure to appear to age rapidly and become distorted, causing the ground in this area to become difficult terrain. If the spiritual disruptor is adjacent to a living target, it attempts to disrupt that target's life energy by making a Strike with its smoking torch. If the spiritual disruptor isn't adjacent to a living target, it Strides toward the closest target. If it has multiple adjacent targets, the spiritual disruptor favors higher-level targets, selecting randomly from multiple adjacent equal-level targets."
  - name: "Reset"
    desc: "If both hazards are disabled or destroyed, a new one forms adjacent to a randomly determined character still inside the crumbling building after 1d4+2 rounds. Once all three NPCs are rescued or exorcised, these hazards don't reset."
