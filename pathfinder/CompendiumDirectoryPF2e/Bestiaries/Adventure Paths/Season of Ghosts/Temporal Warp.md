    desc: "Just as a fight begins, time suddenly seems to break in the area, causing some elements to freeze in place and others to slow down or speed up, imparting a disjointed and nightmarish sensation upon those present."

    desc: "`DC 27 Occultism check` to cause the hazard to fade away and release all those affected by it from the hazard's effects, or `DC 30 Intimidation check` to shock a single adjacent creature out of the distortion and free them from the hazard's effects."

    desc: "`pf2:r` **Trigger** Initiative is rolled at the start of a combat where the PCs face a type of foe they have fought before\n* * *\n\n**Effect** As the combat begins, everything suddenly feels distorted and dreamlike. Just as in dreams, time itself seems to stretch or compress in ways that transform everything into a nightmare. All creatures within a 30-foot burst from the first creature to act in combat must attempt a `DC 25 Will check` saving throw as, for a brief moment, time appears to stand still.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is [[Conditions/Quickened|Quickened]] 1 for 1 minute; it can only use the extra action each round for actions with the move trait.\n\n**Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] for 1 minute.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 3]] as it perceives time to have stopped entirely for it. When it recovers from the stun, it is slowed 1 for 1 minute.\n* * *\n\n_Note: A DC was not provided for this ability by Paizo. The DC present here is a hard DC for the hazard level according to the Gamemastery Guide hazard building Tables._"
