The shisagishin automatically attempts to counteract any attempt to resurrect or animate as undead any creature that it has killed (counteract modifier +21, counteract level 6th).

The shisagishin takes delight in infiltrating a community and then disguising itself as the horribly decayed or mutilated remains of a loved one or adored public figure, only to spring to life in its true form during funeral services. A shisagishin epitomizes the cycle of decay giving rise to new life.

## Handmade Habitats

A shisagishin prefers to roam areas already rife with conflict and potential accidents, but it will happily create such a location if needed. They might poison wells, introduce disease to healthy livestock, or even collaborate with corrupt humans if it means the freedom to kill. Cursed towns or haunted roads are sometimes the playground of such a shisagishin.
