    desc: "`pf2:r` **Trigger** A creature attempts to interact with or speak to the haunt\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The ghostly woman shrieks and rises into the air as her hair grows swiftly, snaking through the shop to tangle into the rafters or weave through the seating area. All creatures in the shop must attempt a `DC 22 Reflex check` save to avoid becoming [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] (or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]] on a critical failure). The haunt then rolls initiative."

  - name: "Routine"
    desc: "(1 action) The haunt targets one creature in the shop at random, preferring targets who are [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]. The ghostly figure moves over to the victim and begins to strangle them with coils of her hair while she begins clawing through the target's hair as if ripping it out by the handful. The target takes 2d8+7 mental damage (`DC 22 Will check` save) from enduring the painful sensations of being strangled and having their hair plucked out, even though they're not actually being physically strangled or losing their hair."
