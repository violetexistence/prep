    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,divine,polymorph) Rin transforms into the tailless form of a specific small human. The tailless form can't be altered and resembles her fox-like humanoid form.\n\nThe monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

  - name: "Foxfire Curse"
    desc: " (curse,fire,primal) A creature damaged by Rin's burning touch must succeed at a `DC 25 Will check` save or become affected by this curse. During a cursed creature's moments of triumph, they become limned with spectral flames that punish their allies. Whenever the cursed creature scores a critical hit, each ally within their reach takes 1d6 persistent fire damage as the cursed creature's hubris sears them."
