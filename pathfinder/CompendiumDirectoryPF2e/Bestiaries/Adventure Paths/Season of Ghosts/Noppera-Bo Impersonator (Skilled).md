    desc: "  The noppera-bo has no sense of vision, but their hearing is precise. They don't breathe and are immune to effects that require breathing. They gain sustenance by absorbing fluids through their skinâ€”traditionally by immersing their hands or faceless head into the fluid to \"drink\" through osmosis; they can also benefit from consumables, such as potions or elixirs, in this way."

  - name: "False Weapon"
    desc: "  A noppera-bo impersonator carries a _+1 striking_ weapon that looks identical to the favored weapon of the PC being impersonated. If the PC favors unarmed strikes, it appears as hand wraps. If the PC favors a ranged weapon, then the noppera-bo impersonator has no melee weapon and instead uses the ranged weapon rules above; otherwise, the noppera-bo impersonator has no ranged weapon. If the PCs favors no weapon, then the noppera-bo wields a club as its false weapon. This false weapon is only partially real and inflicts only mental damage when it hits; it gains none of the original weapon's traits or magical enhancements. If a noppera-bo impersonator's false weapon is broken, disarmed, or set down, it fades away. The noppera-bo impersonator can craft a replacement false weapon by spending 10 minutes to recreate one."

This creature takes the form of the impersonated PC's animal companion, eidolon, or other fighting companion creature; choose a 4th-level creature that approximates the impersonated companion creature's abilities. This creature gains the minion trait.\n*   [[Adventure-Specific Actions/Elemental Attack|Elemental Attack]]\n*   **Sneak Attack** The noppera-bo impersonator deals an additional 1d6 precision damage to [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] creatures.\n*   **Weapon Perk** The noppera-bo impersonator chooses one of the following weapon traits to add to their false weapon: agile, backstabber, disarm, finesse, sweep, or trip."
