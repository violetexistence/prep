    desc: " (concentrate,occult) **Frequency** once per day\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The akashti manifests a hollow humanoid body around its slender skeletal frame over the course of 10 minutes of concentration. If this time is spent within 10 feet of a humanoid body that has been dead for less than a week, the akashti's manifested body looks identical to that of the dead humanoid when they lived and functions as a disguise of that creature. If the akashti can consume a portion of the body it's duplicating, it gains a +4 circumstance bonus to Deception checks to Impersonate the creature. While wearing a manifested body, the akashti loses its claw Strike, and its voice sounds like that of the dead creature; it doesn't possess any of the dead creature's memories or skills and must rely on deception to continue the charade in the face of scrutiny. An akashti's manifested body decays swiftly if it doesn't take 10 minutes once per day to maintain the manifestation of the false flesh. The body has 10 Hit Points and the same defenses as the akashti. When the body is destroyed, the akashti emerges unharmed and the fleshy shell left behind scatters into a cloud of red butterflies that swiftly fade into red mist."

  - name: "Stunning Despair"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (auditory,incapacitation,mental,occult) The akashti unleashes overwhelming sobs of despair. Creatures within 30 feet must attempt a `DC 29 Will check` save or become [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]] ([[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 3]] on a critical failure). The akashti can't use Stunning Despair again for 1d4 rounds."

Akashtis are manipulative fiends who prey on those in mourning; they assume the form of a recently deceased loved one so they can infiltrate homes, then murder and consume the souls of grieving families. Sometimes called a "copycorpse," an akashti in its true form appears as a skin-covered skeleton with sharp talons on its fingers and tears of blood dripping from its lidless eyes. Its skull appears open like a bowl, and inside nest handfuls of crimson butterflies. When an akashti hides within its manifested body, close investigation can sometimes reveal the truth when the scalp of the supposed beloved one returned to life seems to subtly ripple and bulge as the butterflies within writhe. Akashtis embody the complex cycle of grief.

## Deathly Invaders

Sometimes, akashtis ambush and murder targets not to bask in the grief of their loved ones, but instead to assume their form and infiltrate an organization from within to corrupt established bonds of camaraderie. Inevitably, though, these akashtis grow bored with deception and lead their new allies into a trap for slaughter.
