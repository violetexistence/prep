    desc: "`pf2:2` (primal) The imprecasia casts [[Spells/Cleanse Affliction|Cleanse Affliction]] against a curse afflicting a creature, but with a cast of two actions rather than 10 minutes. If they succeed in removing the curse, they also drains vitality from the creature, causing it to become [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]] unless it succeeds at a `DC 30 Fortitude check` save ([[Conditions/Drained|Drained 2]] on a critical failure). If the curse is removed, the imprecasia doesn't expend that use of remove curse as a primal innate spell.\n\n## Targeting Items\n\nAn imprecasia can cast remove curse on a cursed item rather than on a creature, but they can't use Devour Curse on it. They can only do so on an item that's of a level equal to or less than their own level; on a success, the item is uncursed for 24 hours if it's of a level equal to or higher than the imprecasia's level â€“4, or uncursed permanently if it's lower level than that."

An imprecasia, commonly known as a curse eater, is a solitary fey drawn to the energy emanating from curses. They appear as emaciated humanoid creatures with shadowy wings, long thin hands with sharp claws, and insectile heads with feathery antenna.

An imprecasia's appearance in a region signifies the land is troubled, but they're not unpopular creatures. On the contrary, an imprecasia's whereabouts are coveted information, as they have the ability to fully consume curses on objects and creatures. Many carrying the weight of a curse seek out curse eaters, most of whom will gladly accept doomed objects or charitably destroy an individual's curse.

An imprecasia will never accept the idea of healing a cursed land or blighted region. One might even seek to strengthen the afflictions on a region simply to ensure a regular supply of food. A bolder imprecasia tracks cursed families over generations, feeding off their misfortune until the curse ends or the bloodline dies off. Any who attempt to destroy such curses may find themselves the enemy of an imprecasia defending their source of sustenance.
