    desc: "  The condition of a stone spider's vessel dictates its maximum HP. Undamaged, the vessel is an object with 62 HP (BT 31). When the stone spider is in spirit form, damaging it doesn't hurt the vessel, but damaging the vessel deals an equal amount of damage to the stone spider. When the stone spider Inhabits its Vessel, they're a single target, and damage reduces the HP of both the stone spider and the vessel. If the vessel is broken, the stone spider can still fight while inhabiting it and suffers no ill effect, but if the vessel is ever destroyed, the stone spider is instantly slain and can't reconstitute."

The tradition of venerating spiders as wards against vermin, pests, and evil in general far predates the modern jorogumo rule, with stone spiders filling a role similar to stone lions. Stone spider guardian beasts can be found perched on plinths near town and village entrances, standing motionless—for generations in some cases—so that many locals have forgotten their local guardian is anything more than a decoration.
