    desc: "An unsettling wave of malice and sinister energy ripples invisibly out from the manor, causing those who view the building to see a leering, evil face glaring at them from the structure's architecture."

    desc: "`DC 32 Occultism check` or `DC 32 Religion check` to exorcise the haunt, `DC 35 Society check` to approach the manor in a proper way that defers to its occupant's symbolic standing in the community; displaying an official pass that legally grants permission to enter the building reduces both of these DCs by 5 (provided the PCs approach the front door and not from another direction).\n\n`DC 27 Occultism check` `DC 27 Religion check` `DC 30 Society check`"

  - name: "Horrifying Vision"
    desc: "`pf2:r` (emotion, fear, mental, occult) **Trigger** A Small or larger creature approaches within 30 feet of the house's exterior\n* * *\n\n**Effect** A wave of malice fills the minds of all living creatures outside of the manor within 60 feet with overwhelming fear; each creature must attempt a `DC 29 Will check` save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected and is temporarily immune to Horrifying Vision for 24 hours. In addition to this temporary immunity, the creature can attempt a `DC 23 Occultism check` or `DC 23 Religion check` check as a free action to notice that despite there being only one face in the facade, several spiritual echoes seem to infuse the building. On a critical success, the creature realizes that only the most powerful force infusing the manor is evil and that the other elements are non-hostile spirits who are overwhelmed and trapped by that singular force.\n\n**Success** The creature experiences a brief vision of the manor's facade twisting into an immense, horrific face and becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]]. The creature can attempt the same Occultism or Religion check as above, but the DC increases to 33. `DC 33 Occultism check` `DC 33 Religion check`\n\n**Failure** As failure, but the creature becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] and is [[Conditions/Fleeing|Fleeing]] for as long as it remains frightened. The creature can attempt the Occultism or Religion check to Recall Knowledge normally (DC 33).\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature can't reduce its frightened condition below 1 for 1 minute. In addition, the overwhelming fear causes the creature to become [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]]; this condition persists until it's cured magically or the hazard is disabled."
