    desc: "  Noppera-bos have no sense of vision, but their sense of hearing is precise. They don't breathe and are immune to effects that require breathing. They gain sustenance by absorbing fluids through their skin—traditionally by immersing their hands or faceless head into the fluid to \"drink\" through osmosis; they can also benefit from consumables, such as potions or elixirs, in this way."

Noppera-bo grunts lack the social graces necessary to fully disguise themselves with another person's face.

Noppera-bos appear to be regular humans from behind, and might even resemble someone you know, until they turn to reveal a featureless face.

## Consummate Professionals

While the typical noppera-bo is cruel and revels in the act of frightening or tormenting humanoid creatures, not all of them wallow in evil. Neutral noppera-bos tend to be pranksters who use their abilities to trick and tease, while the rare good noppera- bos instead use their abilities to honor and idolize those they admire while focusing their own time on developing their skills at art or crafting.

## Noppera-bo Origins

There are many theories on the origins of noppera-bos—from tanuki whose change shape ability went wrong, to humanoids who were warped by curses, to naturally spawning yokai. Some even theorize this condition is a transmissible curse like lycanthropy. Most noppera-bos don't recall their origins, and are often more interested in pretending to be someone else entirely.
