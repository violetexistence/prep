In addition, their flesh withers and weakens, leaving them to appear old and decrepitâ€”the creature becomes [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] and [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]] until the curse is removed.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature takes 30d6 void damage and becomes cursed as failure, but becomes [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 2]] and [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 2]]."
