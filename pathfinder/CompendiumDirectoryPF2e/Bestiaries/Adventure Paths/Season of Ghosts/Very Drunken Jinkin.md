Variant jinkins

Jinkins are sadistic tinkers who steal and sabotage items and take great pride in their power to curse precious objects. They hold grudges and create convoluted plans for revenge whenever they feel slighted, such as when a creature dares to remove one of their curses. Rarely content to wreak simple mayhem, jinkins also take immense pleasure in torture and murder, though they prefer to lead victims into traps designed to capture or incapacitate rather than kill outright. Deep pits are favorites, since victims who survive the fall face a slow death from starvation and thirst. Jinkins enjoy gathering at the edge of pits to mock, tease, and torment.

Gremlins are cruel fey tricksters and saboteurs who have fully acclimated to life on the Material Plane, finding distinct niches for their inventive destructiveness. All gremlins delight in ruining or breaking things, whether it's something physical like a device or vehicle or something intangible such as an alliance or relationship. A gremlin's greatest joy is watching the collapse of complex creations, preferably after the lightest and slightest, carefully targeted push from the gremlin. Gremlins tend to denigrate, bully, or even slaughter their lesser kin, particularly mitflits, whom gremlins (and many others) derisively call "mites."
