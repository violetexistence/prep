    desc: " (concentrate,occult) **Frequency** once per day\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The false governor has manifested a hollow humanoid body around their slender skeletal frame that looks identical to that of Governor Heh Shan-Bao. While wearing this manifested body, the false governor loses their claw Strike, and their voice sounds like that of Heh Shan-Bao's. The false governor's manifested body decays swiftly if they don't take 10 minutes once per day to maintain the manifestation of the false flesh. The body has 10 Hit Points and the same defenses as the false governor. When the body is destroyed, the false governor emerges unharmed, and the fleshy shell left behind scatters into a cloud of red butterflies that swiftly fade into red mist. This emergence is so grisly and unsettling that all creatures within 30 feet who witness it must attempt a `DC 29 Fortitude check` save or become [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]] ([[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 3]] on a critical failure); this has the mental and visual traits."

  - name: "Stunning Despair"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (auditory,incapacitation,mental,occult) The false governor unleashes several overwhelming sobs of despair. Creatures within 30 feet must attempt a `DC 29 Will check` save to avoid becoming [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]] ([[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 3]] on a critical failure). The false governor can't use Stunning Despair again for 1d4 rounds."

Variant akashti nindoru

Akashtis are manipulative fiends who prey on those in mourning; they assume the form of a recently deceased loved one so they can infiltrate homes, then murder and consume the souls of grieving families. Sometimes called a "copycorpse," an akashti in its true form appears as a skin-covered skeleton with sharp talons on its fingers and tears of blood dripping from its lidless eyes. Its skull appears open like a bowl, and inside nest handfuls of crimson butterflies. When an akashti hides within its manifested body, close investigation can sometimes reveal the truth when the scalp of the supposed beloved one returned to life seems to subtly ripple and bulge as the butterflies within writhe. Akashtis embody the complex cycle of grief.

## Deathly Invaders

Sometimes, akashtis ambush and murder targets not to bask in the grief of their loved ones, but instead to assume their form and infiltrate an organization from within to corrupt established bonds of camaraderie. Inevitably, though, these akashtis grow bored with deception and lead their new allies into a trap for slaughter.
