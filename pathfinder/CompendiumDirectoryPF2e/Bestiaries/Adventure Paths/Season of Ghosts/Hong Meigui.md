    desc: "  All jiang-shi possess the following vulnerabilities.\n\n*   **Revulsion** A jiang-shi can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of a brandished mirror or the sound of ringing handbells. A creature can Interact with a mirror or handbell to brandish or ring the item for 1 round (similar to Raising a Shield). If the jiang-shi involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of their revulsion, they gain the [[Conditions/Fleeing|Fleeing]] condition, running from the object of their revulsion until they are 10 feet or farther from the object. After 1 round of being exposed to the object of their revulsion, a jiang-shi can attempt a `DC 25 Will check` save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, they overcome their revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success).\n*   **Bitter Epiphany** A jiang-shi is afflicted by severe melancholia when reminded of their debased nature and the truth of their existential disconnection from living beings. When a jiang-shi sees an altar with at least 1 Bulk of food offerings to ancestor spirits, they must attempt a `DC 25 Will check` save. They are then temporarily immune to Bitter Epiphany for 1 minute.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The jiang-shi is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The jiang-shi is [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] for 1 round.\n\n**Failure** The jiang-shi is [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] for 1 minute.\n\n**Critical Failure** The jiang-shi is stupefied 2 and [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]] for 1 minute."

    desc: " (divine,void) Unlike other undead, a jiang-shi isn't destroyed at 0 HP. Instead, they fall [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]] and awaken in 1 minute with 1 Hit Point.

A creature can [[Actions/Steal|Steal]] the fulu to remove it, rolling against the jiangshi's Perception DC. This immediately ends the jiang-shi's immunity to these effects. If a creature then destroys the removed fulu with an Interact action, the jiang-shi also loses their fast healing ability. A jiang-shi can create a replacement fulu by spending 1 uninterrupted hour inscribing a strip of paper (or similar) with a writing instrument."

This requires an `Athletics check` check against the victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The victim is [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]] and the jiang-shi regains 12 healing HP, gaining any excess as temporary Hit Points. Draining qi from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the jiang-shi but increases the victim's drained condition value by 1, killing the victim when it reaches drained 5. If the victim has the ability to cast ki spells, it can spend 1 Focus Point to avoid becoming drained. This protects it only from the current attack, not from subsequent attempts to Drain Qi.\n\nA victim's drained condition value decreases by 1 every week. If the creature restricts their diet to glutinous rice for at least 1 day and spends 10 minutes dancing, jogging, or otherwise engaging in vigorous physical activity by succeeding at a `DC 25 Athletics check` check, it reduces its drained condition by 1."

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

Female provincial jiang-shi

Jiang-shi are terrifying hopping vampires from Tian Xia. Though similar to other vampires—they are undead, drain vital energy from the living, and can be slain only in specific ways—jiang-shi feast upon the breath of the living, also known as qi or ki, instead of blood. While they possess unique powers, including their magic-deflecting paper fulus, extraordinary jumping ability, and immunity to sunlight, jiang-shi also possess unique vulnerabilities, such as the inability to see living creatures save through breathsense, a revulsion to bells and mirrors, and near-stupefying melancholia. Thankfully, most jiang-shi can't create vampiric spawn.

Roused rudely from their nightmarish slumber, the provincial jiang-shi roams the villages and graveyards around their domain searching for sustenance to slake their hunger.
