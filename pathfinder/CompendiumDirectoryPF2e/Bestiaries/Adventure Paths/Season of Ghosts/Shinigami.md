    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,divine,polymorph) The shinigami takes on the appearance of a specific Small or Medium humanoid creature. This doesn't change their statistics, other than to remove the reach trait from their Strikes. The shinigami's human shape is unique to the shinigami and can't be used to Impersonate a creature.\n\nThe monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

If the shinigami dies, the gems are destroyed as well, and any souls they contain are released harmlessly to travel to the Boneyard."

All creatures within a 30-foot emanation take 18d6 untyped damage (`DC 38 Fortitude check` save); the shinigami chooses whether this damage is vitality damage or void damage. A creature who takes damage from this effect and fails the saving throw is also [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]] and [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]] (or [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 4]] and [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 2]] on a critical failure)."

Even immortals such as kami aren't immune to death. When a kami or equally powerful entity refuses the call of the Boneyard, a shinigami is summoned to bring these stubborn souls to heel. Exact and swift, shinigami are known to dispense the judgment of death efficiently and dispassionately.

## Guardians Of The Cycle

Shinigami are responsible for investigating and dealing with widespread phenomena that disrupt the natural flow of life. They might be tasked with solving the issue or be told to wait, observe, and provide minimal assistance. While most shinigami can retain their impartiality during such long vigils, some are far from emotionless and end up wavering toward mercy or cruelty.
