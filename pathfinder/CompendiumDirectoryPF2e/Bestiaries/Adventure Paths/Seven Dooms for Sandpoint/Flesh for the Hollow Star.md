    desc: "The flesh and leather sculpture of Azathoth seems to ripple and churn before eyes open across its surfaceâ€”eyes that then open into mouths that extend long whipping tendrils of rasping filaments to bless with warped flesh."

    desc: "`DC 23 Thievery check` twice to pull away one of the two primary anchor points for the sculpture to cause the leather and bones to slump harmlessly to the floor, `DC 26 Religion check` from a worshipper of a lawful or good faith to banish Azathoth's influence from the hazard, or [[Spells/Dispel Magic|Dispel Magic]] (3rd rank, counteract DC 20) to counteract the hazard"

    desc: "`pf2:r` (emotion, fear, mental, occult) **Trigger** a non-worshipper of Azathoth approaches within 5 feet, or a non-worshipper of Azathoth attacks Ziradini in this room\n* * *\n\n**Effect** A dozen eyes blink open on the spherical shape to glare at the triggering creature, who must succeed at a `DC 22 Will check` save or become [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]] ([[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] on a critical failure). The trap then rolls initiative."

  - name: "Routine"
    desc: "(2 actions; necromancy, occult) The eyes open like mouths to extrude a whipping tangle of filaments that lash out at a target in area **F19** or within 10 feet of any entrance into the room. The filaments can't attack a single target more than once per round. A creature targeted by a filament must attempt a `DC 22 Fortitude check` save. The body of a creature slain by poison damage from this hazard melts into a heap and then splits open to allow a gibbering mouther to slither free; this creature attacks any non-worshipper of Azathoth it sees, or otherwise slithers off to area **F20** to splash and gyre in the waters of the lake.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature takes 2d6 poison damage.\n\n**Failure** The creature takes 2d6+7 poison damage and becomes [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]] as their flesh and muscles grow limp and saggy.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but 4d6+14 poison damage and [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 2]]."
  - name: "Reset"
    desc: "The trap deactivates and resets after a worshipper of Azathoth spends 1 hour in prayer before it."
