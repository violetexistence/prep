Somewhat larger than the giant longlegs, the sicklefang is named for their unusually large, curved mandibles, which they use to bleed prey with deadly efficiency.

While smaller specimens of these unsettling-looking arachnids (known regionally by names like harvesters, tickle spiders, or daddy longlegs) are harmless, their larger cousins, known simply as longlegs, are anything but.

## Longlegs Species

Beyond the two common types presented here, many other variants of longlegs can be found throughout Golarion, with the exception of its arctic regions, where longlegs don't thrive. They often live on the periphery of cities, lurking in sewers or ruins where the hunting is good. Swarms of sewer longlegs are particularly dangerous and infest the undercities of many Taldan settlements, while to the west in Cheliax, the much-larger executor longlegs prefer to live among the rooflines of slums where Thrune's rule has been particularly horrific. Among the largest of all longlegs, though, is the dreaded (and thankfully rare) treeleg harvester of the Mwangi Expanse.
