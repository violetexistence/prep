    desc: "(2 actions) The clouds of vermin in the room fill the air, rain down from the walls and ceiling, and swarm up from the floor below. All creatures in the room are subjected to Swarming Bites on the hazard's first action. On the second action, the swarming vermin grow particularly dense and eager in their attentions to one randomly determined creature in area **J3c**. If that creature is suffering from ghast fever and is at stage 4 or lower, they must immediately attempt a `DC 30 Fortitude check` save. On a failure, the stage of their ghast fever advances one step."

    desc: "The hazard settles back down 1 round after all creatures leave the room and can trigger again at the start of the next round."
