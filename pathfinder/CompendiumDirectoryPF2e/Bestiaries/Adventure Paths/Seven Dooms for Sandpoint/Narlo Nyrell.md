    desc: "  Hundreds of biting flies crawl over Narlo's bones, filling out his armor almost like his flesh once did. When these flies burn, they harm Narlo as well, imparting weakness to fire 5. Whenever Narlo casts a spell, these flies burst from his body to fill a 10-foot emanation around him in a buzzing, biting cloud until the start of his next turn. During this time, he loses his weakness to fire, and any creature that ends their turn within the emanation takes 4d6 piercing damage (`DC 23 Reflex check` save) from the biting flies."

Male herexen oracle

When a cleric rebels against their deity and dies in the grip of blasphemous rage, the heresies they committed in life may fuel their transformation into an undead herexen. Herexens seek vengeance against the deity they once worshipped, defiling temples, slaying the faithful, and rallying lesser undead and death cultists to aid them in their unholy quests. Though a herexen's divine gifts have mostly been corrupted into the vileness of undeath, they stubbornly cling to remnants of their former power, still wielding magic and armaments favored by the deity they so greatly despise.

Groups of herexens that blasphemed against the same deity sometimes combine to form a mockery of a congregation, conducting blasphemous rites with something approaching euphoria. These congregations are more often formed from a blasphemous cult who practiced their heresy together in life and died together, though some gather independent herexens of the same former faith.
