Variant divine warden

This divine warden serves Nethys, the neutral god of magic. It uses its divine gift to defend temples or shrines of [[Deities/Nethys|Nethys]].

* * *

Created through complex rituals performed by a faith's adherents, divine wardens have been imbued with a fraction of the power that courses through a champion or cleric of a particular deity. This divine spark allows the divine warden to serve as the protector for a temple, shrine, or other holy site. Such guardians aren't intrinsically bound to a fixed location, but they rarely leave the temple or site over which they watch.

Most divine wardens have been crafted from clay, stone, wood, or similar materials and typically have features that resemble a deity or a deity's herald. Divine wardens often have other abilities typically exhibited by constructs, such as armor plating, the ability to disguise themselves as statues, or other similar benefits.

The faithful worshippers who craft divine wardens typically animate the constructs using a special ritual in which the followers beseech their deity to empower the guardian. The divine mandate that imbues a divine warden with power also allows the sentinel to recognize enemies of its deity and prevents the construct from attacking other members of the faith, unless these patrons choose to attack it first.

In rare cases or particularly dire times, a deity might create a divine warden by directly animating an existing statue or idol to aid faithful followers. These divine guardians are most likely to be found outside of their original locations, assisting displaced congregations or pursuing those who might harm the faithful.
