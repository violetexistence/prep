  - name: "Body Thief"
    desc: "`pf2:3` (manipulate,occult,possession) The intellect devourer reduces in size and burrows into the brain of a creature dead for no longer than 1 day. At the start of the intellect devourer's next turn, the body revives at its maximum Hit Points, controlled by the devourer. The intellect devourer is conscious and can sense everything the possessed body could.\n\nAny effect that ends the possession kills the host body with the same effects as Exit Body. The intellect devourer can't use any of the host creature's spells with Body Thief but can use its own spells.\n\nThe host body slowly decays while inhabited by the intellect devourer, becoming uninhabitable after 7 days unless preserved with [[Spells/Peaceful Rest|Peaceful Rest]] or a similar effect."

  - name: "Exit Body"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (move) **Requirements** The intellect devourer is controlling a body with Body Thief\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The intellect devourer leaves its host body, which dies instantly and is no longer a suitable host for any Body Thief ability. The intellect devourer appears at full size in an adjacent space."

  - name: "Nightmare Curse"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (curse,illusion,incapacitation,mental,occult) **Frequency** once per day\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Tiluatchek reaches out with his mind to infect the dreams of a single creature within 60 feet that he can see. The target suddenly experiences a brief but overwhelming memory of a harrowing nightmare it had at some point in the past and must attempt a `DC 32 Will check` save. The effects of this curse are permanent until the target is cured (although any frightened condition values imparted by the curse pass and end normally).\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected, and the nightmare vision passes as swiftly as it appears.\n\n**Success** The vision causes the target to become [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]]. The target also becomes cursed. Every time it attempts to sleep, it's plagued by nightmares of being stalked through an endless maze of caverns by something that wants to steal its body and eat its brain. The cursed creature now requires 10 hours of rest (rather than 8) in order to be able to make its daily preparations and can't take the Long-Term Rest activity at all.\n\n**Failure** As success, but [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]], and each time the target sleeps, it suffers the effects of a [[Spells/Nightmare|Nightmare]] spell (`DC 32 Will check` save).\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 3]] and [[Conditions/Fleeing|Fleeing]] for as long as it remains frightened. If the cursed target ever rolls a critical failure against a nightmare spell while it remains cursed (including those caused by the curse itself), it dies in its sleep. If at the time of this death Tiluatchek is also dead (but for no more than 1 year), the intellect devourer is restored to life inside of the target creature's body as if he'd used Body Thief to take the body over."

  - name: "Ravage"
    desc: "`pf2:3` (death) The intellect devourer makes two talon Strikes against a [[Conditions/Paralyzed|Paralyzed]], [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]], or [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]] creature, using the same attack modifier as its highest attack modifier.\n\nThese Strikes gain the death trait. If Ravage kills the target, the intellect devourer may use Body Thief against it as a free action."

  - name: "Stolen Identity"
    desc: "  While an intellect devourer uses Body Thief, it gains the ability to understand and speak all languages known by the host, as well as knowledge of the host body's abilities, identity, role in society, and personality. However, it does not gain the specific memories or knowledge of the host body."

Genderfluid intellect devourer transmuter

Intellect devourers serve as advance scouts and infiltrators for the powerful force of alien beings called the Dominion of the Black. These monsters roam the Darklands, from which they mount secret invasions of the world above. When an intellect devourer infiltrates a society, its first priority is to acquire a body. It might first seek out a graveyard for a fresh corpse, as this is easier than fighting and killing someone. When the aberration compresses itself into the host's brain cavity, its real body goes dull to sensation as it connects to the nervous system of its host. If found out, an intellect devourer might quickly inhabit a new body to make its escape, preferably something inconspicuous such as a domestic animal.
