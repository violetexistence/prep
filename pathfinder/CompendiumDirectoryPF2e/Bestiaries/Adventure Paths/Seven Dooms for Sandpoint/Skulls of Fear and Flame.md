    desc: "`DC 27 Stealth check` to move through the room unseen by the skulls (this does not disable the trap but does prevent it from triggering), `DC 27 Thievery check` three times to \"blind\" an adjacent skull by deftly scraping hidden runes away from the inside of the eye sockets, or [[Spells/Dispel Magic|Dispel Magic]] (4th rank, counteract DC 25) to counteract the trap"

    desc: "`pf2:r` (arcane, emotion, fear) **Trigger** A creature walks into view of the skulls and is spotted by them\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The candles atop all six skulls flare to light and the skulls shriek out fearsome, mind-numbing howls. All creatures in area **F6**, the stairs, or the eastern trough must attempt a `DC 25 Will check` save. The trap then rolls initiative.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]].\n\n**Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] and [[Conditions/Fleeing|Fleeing]] as long as they remain frightened.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but once the creature is no longer frightened, the previous minute of memories are erasedâ€”likely removing knowledge of the secret door at the top of the stairs in area **E7a**. All that remains are strange lingering fears about returning to the area."

    desc: "(6 actions) On its initiative the trap uses its first action to rotate a skull that can't see targets a full 360 degrees, stopping as soon as the skull spots a target. It repeats this action until all six skulls are looking at targets, then uses its remaining actions to shoot beams of fire from their eyes. The trap can only target a creature once per round, so if there are fewer targets than actions, any additional actions possessed by the trap are lost. The trap loses one action for each skull that is destroyed."
  - name: "Reset"
    desc: "If there are no visible targets, the trap deactivates at the end of its turn, then automatically resets."
