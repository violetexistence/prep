Although the coloxus has the hideous head of a monstrous fly, these demons are fastidious and clean, always dressing in stylish clothing without a blemish on them. Coloxuses are manipulators and schemers born from destructively vain souls. Evil mortals are fond of conjuring them to serve as emissaries or spies, but they also make excellent assassins. Even in the role of murderer, the demon remains cloyingly polite and formal, reveling in the irony of perpetuating such a horrible crime under the guise of good etiquette, as if it were a delicate bit of diplomacy.

## Enemies Of Filth

Filth is often inescapable in the Abyss, and as a result, coloxus demons are particularly eager to be conjured away from that plane to work their evils in cleaner realities. When one uses _planar ally_ or _planar binding_ to conjure a coloxus, summoning it into a clean environment and promising you won't compel it to serve under filthy conditions may make the demon easier to bargain with. At the GM's discretion, the demon may agree to serve you for longer or at a lower cost than normal.
