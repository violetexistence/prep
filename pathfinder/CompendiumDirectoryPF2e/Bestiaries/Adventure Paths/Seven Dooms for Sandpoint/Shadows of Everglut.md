    desc: "Three `DC 33 Arcana check` or `DC 33 Occultism check` checks to redirect the negative energy back in on itself and disrupt the hazard's source of power, a `DC 36 Religion check` check to offer prayers to sever the sacred link to Kabriri, or [[Spells/Dispel Magic|Dispel Magic]] (6th rank; counteract DC 29) to render the hazard inert for 10 minutes"

    desc: "`pf2:r` (divine, incapacitation) **Trigger** A creature moves into the room beyond the northern stairs\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Shadowy tendrils wisp up from the darkness below to brush against the triggering creature's body. The creature must attempt a `DC 30 Fortitude check` save or their strength is sapped from their body. The hazard then rolls initiative.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature's speeds are reduced by 10 feet for 1 round.\n\n**Failure** As success, but the creature also falls [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]].\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature also becomes [[Conditions/Paralyzed|Paralyzed]]. It can attempt a new save at the end of each of its turns, and the DC cumulatively decreases by 1 on each such save."

    desc: "(1 action) The shadows writhing on the floor extrude a storm of inky tentacles of smoke and darkness that whip and writhe throughout the room, filling the air with unsettling sounds of agonizing cries and shrieks. All creatures in area **J3a** take 8d6 void damage (`DC 30 Fortitude check` save)."

    desc: "The hazard settles back down 1 round after all creatures leave the room and can trigger again at the start of the next round."
