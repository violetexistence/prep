    desc: "`pf2:r` (incapacitation, linguistic, mental) **Trigger** A creature attempts to open the door or damages the door with a Strike or spell\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The door whispers into the triggering creature's ear, speaking in one of the following three languages: Shoanti, Thassilonian, or Varisian. If the target creature speaks any of these languages, it hears the whispers in the tongue it is most comfortable speaking. If the target does not speak these languages, the trap's whispers have no effect. If the target understands the whispers, the trap casts suggestion on the target (`DC 25 Will check` save), suggesting they \"stand guard before the door and fight any who attempt to pass by it to enter the chamber beyond until Mistress Liralarue's arrival.\" Once, the whispers also alerted Liralarue, but as she is long gone now, the PCs don't need to fear the arrival of a powerful runelord's apprentice."

    desc: "The trap resets over the course of a round and is ready to whisper at the next person who attempts to open the door 1 round later."
