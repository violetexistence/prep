If a family of zoogs avoids infighting and locates a reliable enough food source, their numbers can swell into truly massive swarms.

* * *

Furry, tentacle-snouted, and prone to chittering, zoogs dwell in the shadowy parts of the world where dreams have an uncanny knack for coming true. They typically gather in small families, and while zoogs normally eat fungi and plants, some have developed a taste for sentient beings.

## Zoogs Vs. Cats

Zoogs and cats have a storied hatred, though neither side can remember the original cause. Zoogs have been known to prey on kittens, but their courage fails quickly when confronted by a full-grown cat. Cats, on the other hand, are always quick to pounce, chase, and attack zoogs on sight.
