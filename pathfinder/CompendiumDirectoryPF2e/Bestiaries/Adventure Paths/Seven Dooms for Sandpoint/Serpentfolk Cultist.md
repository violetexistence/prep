Variant serpentfolk bone prophet

The speakers for the dead known as bone prophets hold an esteemed place as voices for their decapitated god. Burial rites, necromantic rituals, and the delivery of cryptic utterances supposedly whispered to them by Ydersius all fall under the dominion of these priests. Bone prophets often raise fallen aapophs as skeletons.
