    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,occult,polymorph) The Red Bishop takes on the appearance of a Tiny red sea gull or red hawk. This doesn't change his speed, but he can't make Strikes in this form.\n* * *\n\nThe monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

The Red Bishop restores 7d8+8 healing Hit Points to himself, and the target creature loses the frightened condition but must also attempt a `DC 34 Will check` save as other emotions are drawn out of their mind as well to fade uselessly away, resulting in mental trauma and a strange numbness in the mind itself.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The target takes 3d6 mental damage.\n\n**Failure** The target takes 6d6 mental damage and is [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] until the end of its next turn.\n\n**Critical Failure** The target takes 12d6 mental damage and is stupefied 1 until the condition is removed via an effect like restoration."

The target must immediately attempt a Will save against the mothman's portentous gaze.\n\nIf the creature is already frightened when it attempts this save, on a failure it becomes [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] for 24 hours in addition to the frightened effect.\n\nAfter attempting its save, the creature is then temporarily immune for 1 minute."

Male mothman agent of Pazuzu

Little is known of the strange creatures known as mothmen, save that when they make themselves known, calamity is sure to follow. The mothman sees themself as an agent of fate-provided such fate is devastating and destructive. Often, those who encounter a mothman never recall the meeting, yet live on to unknowingly pursue and enable the creature's obscure plans.

The name "mothmen" is, of course, not these creatures' own name for themselves, but an appellation granted by the fearful who glimpse them and tell harrowing tales of their sightings. They each keep their own names, or a collection for use in different situations, yet have no need for a collective word for their kind.
