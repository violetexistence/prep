    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,occult,polymorph) The gosreg takes on the appearance of any Small or Medium humanoid. This doesn't change its Speed or its attack and damage modifiers with its Strikes, but it might change the damage type its Strikes deal (typically to bludgeoning).\n* * *\n\nThe monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

  - name: "Mind Bolt"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (illusion,mental,occult) A gosreg concentrates its field of discordant mental energy and projects it into the mind of an enemy within 60 feet. The target takes 6d6 mental damage (`DC 30 Will check` save). On a critical failure, the creature is also [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]] for 1d4 rounds."

Variant gosreg

Gosregs are agents of the Dominion of the Black that insinuate themselves into humanoid societies to foster the goals of their sinister alien masters. They act as spies and special forces that can mingle with humanoid society while enacting plans for the rest of the Dominion in secret.

In their natural forms, gosregs dart about in a jerky gallop due to their stumpy legs and gangly arms. They take on the appearances of humanoids to infiltrate societies, and they drop their disguises only when they feel they are ultimately compromised and must resort to physical violence to protect their agendas. Their brain-like heads and bestial legs suggest a potential link with a similar Dominion of the Black agent: the dreaded intellect devourer.
