A creature that gives the wrong answer or tries to pass without answering must succeed at a `DC 26 Will check` save or be affected by one of the following spells, chosen by the sphinx when creating the symbol: [[Spells/Synaptic Pulse|Synaptic Pulse]] (5th), [[Spells/Charm|Charm]] (4th), [[Spells/Fear|Fear]] (4th), [[Spells/Phantom Pain|Phantom Pain]] (4th), [[Spells/Sleep|Sleep]] (4th). The sphinx learns the identity of any creature that answers the riddle and tends to be friendly to them if they answered correctly."
