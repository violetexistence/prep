    desc: "  In place of the spell's typical effect, the metal scamp can cast magnetic attraction to send metal tools, ingots, and other objects flying throughout the workshop interior. This deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage (`DC 16 Reflex check`) to all creatures inside the workshop except those with greater cover or the metal trait. Once per round, the scamp can Sustain the spell to repeat the damage. While this effect is active, the scamps are in contact with metal for the purpose of their fast healing."

Variant metal scamp

The capricious and destructive metal scamps are self-appointed forces of entropy, taking great pleasure in indiscriminately wrecking everything around them, sometimes even to their own detriment. Metal scamps have a severe appearance, with pointed facial features and angular limbs, and their skin can be the color of any metal, often heavily oxidized as if by years of exposure to the elements.
