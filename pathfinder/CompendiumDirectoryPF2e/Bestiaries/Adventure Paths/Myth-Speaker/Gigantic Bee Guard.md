These specialized worker bees investigate danger, protect the hive, and attack intruders. They're particularly sensitive to the pheromones of their colony and respond quickly to threats.

* * *

The honeybee is industrious and generally quite gentle. Following an upwelling of mythic power, however, a number of bee colonies found themselves transformed into gigantic specimens, along with the fields where they harvest nectar. These bees act mostly as they did prior to the infusion of mythic power, except they're far better able to defend themselves and their hives.

## Honey and Medicine

The honey produced by bees possesses several properties that make it useful for the treatment of wounds. It helps prevent infection and inflammation, and many folk remedies make use of it. The honey of gigantic bees, being infused with mythic power, is an even more potent healing aid. A character who manages to get their hands on such a substance heals 1 extra point of damage when using it as part of a successful [[Actions/Treat Wounds|Treat Wounds]] skill check.

## Other Giant Parasites

With the sudden infusion of mythic energy in Iblydos, the danger of giant versions of parasitic creatures is a very real threat. Increased size usually means increased appetite, and such creatures pose a danger not just to adventurers but livestock as well. Giant ticks, for instance, have long been a danger in the deepest wilderness, and now there are reports of housecat-sized fleas and lice.
