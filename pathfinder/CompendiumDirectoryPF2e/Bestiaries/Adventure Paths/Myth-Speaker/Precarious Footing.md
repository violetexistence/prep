    desc: "`pf2:r` **Trigger** A creature steps into the pit or within 5 feet of its edge\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The ground crumbles apart and the creature slides into the lava. That creature can use the [[Actions/Grab an Edge|Grab an Edge]] reaction to avoid falling. Otherwise it falls 20 feet (taking 10 fall damage) and is exposed to lava, taking 6d6 fire damage per round of contact. Climbing the crumbling rock face requires a successful `DC 20 Athletics check` check."
