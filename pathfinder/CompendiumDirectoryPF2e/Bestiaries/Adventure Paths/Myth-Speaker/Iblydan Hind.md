An unusual breed of cervid, Iblydan hinds are closer to the size of a bull or a moose than the average deer, often ten feet or more in height. They have smooth, pale coats, hooves formed of bronze, and both the males and the females of the species bear antlers of pure gold. Iblydan hinds are known for their exceptional speed and agility as well as their intelligence, making them extraordinarily elusive in the wild.

There's some debate as to the origins of the Iblydan hind. Some scholars believe the species came to the Universe from the First World through a long-ago planar breach, noting how the hinds' unusual characteristics are similar to the unpredictable evolutions of creatures from that plane. Others point to historical records that indicate the hind was purposefully bred by ancient druidic circles, though the purpose of their creation has been lost to time.

Regardless of their pedigree, Iblydan hinds are a key symbol of Iblydan culture, often depicted in art and heraldry, with various superstitions surrounding them. A recurring element in hero-god stories is for an Iblydan hind to lead a hero-god to the correct path when they become lost, and it's said that a hunter who glimpses a hind in the forest is assured of a long life and good fortune. Due to the hinds' near-sacred status throughout Iblydos, slaying one is banned by all the city-states and punishable by exile, even death. In tribute to the hinds' fire breath, a common punishment for poachers is a trial by fire; if they survive the flames, they're allowed to live in exile.

## Chasing the Hind

Chasing down and catching an Iblydan hind is a well-known rite of passage for Iblydan heroes and hero-gods, who often use this as a test of their speed and stamina. "Hind catching" is also a common game at festivals, with a dog or deer standing in for the hind, and golden antlers are a popular hair accessory at these events. Heroes aim to catch and release the hind without harming it; however, some who pursue Iblydan hinds do so with darker motivations, as the creatures' golden antlers fetch a high price on the black market.
