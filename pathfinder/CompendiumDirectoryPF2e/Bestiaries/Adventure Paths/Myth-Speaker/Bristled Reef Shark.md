Small enough to slip through labyrinthine corals yet large enough to overpower potential prey, bristled reef sharks prowl coastal reefs at night. By day, they're gregarious creatures that congregate in large groups and communicate with each other by performing dance-like maneuvers. On occasion, the sharks team up to drive away predators or mob large prey; more often, they dart for cover amid the corals. Those that aren't fast enough to avoid being swallowed by orcas and larger sharks flare their dorsal spines, forcing most predators to cough up the bristled shark who quickly flees to safety.
