    desc: "`pf2:2`  Sappil Casts a Spell that takes 1 or 2 actions to cast and requires a spell attack roll and makes a melee Strike, using the attack roll result to determine the effects of both the Strike and the spell. This counts as two actions for his multiple attack penalty, but he doesn't apply the penalty until after he's completed the Spellstrike. This grants the Strike the arcane and magical traits. After using Spellstrike, Sappil can't do so again for 1d4 rounds."
