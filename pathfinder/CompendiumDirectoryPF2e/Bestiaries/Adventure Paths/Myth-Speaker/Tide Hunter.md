    desc: " With a crew of 20 or more skilled rowers, the Tide Hunter can turn swiftly, turn in place, or row backward. Each 90-degree turn made while moving less than 150 feet costs 5 extra feet of movement. It can row backward at half speed, and it can't turn while rowing backward. With a crew of at least 40 rowers, the Tide Hunter's rowed speed increases to 40 feet."
