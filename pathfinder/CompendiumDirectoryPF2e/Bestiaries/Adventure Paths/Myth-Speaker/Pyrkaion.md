Reality is imperfect, yet many mortals focus on their world's virtues while refusing to address its failures. A pyrkaion believes mortal delusion is the last wall propping up a broken universe, and wisdom is the pickaxe that will tear it down. Pyrkaions vacillate between teaching mortals enough to wither from indulgent self-awareness and shredding their students' institutions through insidious interrogation that leads to infighting as the asura watches.

## Philosophical Zeal

With each philosophical victory, these asuras increasingly wrestle with their own thoughts, recognizing that they're as vulnerable to self-delusion as their victims. This can drive a pyrkaion to ravenous fits of reading and research before jealously sequestering the texts. Sometimes a pyrkaion with an inflated ego instead seeks and loses debates, craving the sting of humility to recenter their thoughts.
