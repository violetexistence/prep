    desc: "  Displaying the hospitality that a xenia spirit was denied in life can avert its wrath. A plate of food, mug of fine drink, or similar fare held in one hand can be Raised as a Shield and used to Shield Block the spirit's attacks as if it were a buckler; a creature can Shield Block in this way even if they lack the feat."

  - name: "Libation Weakness"
    desc: "  Pouring fine drink onto a xenia spirit can harm it. This functions like an alchemical weapon with a range increment of 10 feet and the bomb, consumable, spirit, and splash traits. A drink worth at least 1 cp (such as common ale) deals 1d4 spirit damage and 1 spirit splash damage. A drink worth at least 1 sp (such as a bottle of wine) deals 1d8 spirit damage and 1 spirit splash damage. As an Interact action, a creature can anoint a weapon with fine drink; the weapon's next successful Strike damages, the xenia spirit as though it had a ghost touch rune."

    desc: "`pf2:1`  The ghost possesses an object of size Large or smaller within 20 feet, making it an animated object. This animated object's level can be no higher than the ghost's level -2. If the target object is being held by a creature, the bearer can attempt a `Will check` save to prevent the possession.\n\nThis possession ends when the object is destroyed or the ghost leaves it. At this point, the ghost reappears in the object's square and can't Inhabit an Object again for 1d4 rounds.\n\nFor DCs, use the high spell DC of the ghost's level."

  - name: "Starving Invocation"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (auditory,divine) The xenia spirit laments the hospitality it was denied, awakening painful hunger in others. Each living creature within 30 feet must attempt a `DC 21 Fortitude check` save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is immune for 24 hours.\n\n**Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]]. A creature sickened in this way can ingest food and drink, and it can only recover from the sickened condition by spending an Interact action to consume food within reach.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]]."
