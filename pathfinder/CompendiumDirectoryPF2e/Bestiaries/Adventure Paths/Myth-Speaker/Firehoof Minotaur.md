Roll once and apply the result to all creatures. If the targets have their vision effected by smoke or a similar effect, the minotaur gains a +4 circumstance bonus to this check. Each target is temporarily immune for 10 minutes."

As the birthplace of the legendary first minotaur Tavdrinos, Iblydos is still home to many varieties of minotaurs not found elsewhere in the world. Among these are firehoof minotaurs, large creatures who are fused with elemental, sometimes even infernal fire. Firehoof minotaurs are known for their fierce tempers and skill at combat. Instead of mazes, they prefer to fill an area with smoke and stalk their prey while they're hazily visible.

## Mazes And Labyrinths

Although they're often used interchangeably, the terms maze and labyrinth have slightly different meanings. While a labyrinth has a single path to the center, a maze has multiple ones. Minotaurs see this distinction as vital and symbolic of free will versus fixed fate. Some traditionalist minotaurs see life as having one path: to follow in the footsteps of Tavdrinos. They believe there's no escape from this. But most minotaurs prefer to see life as a maze where one must choose the best way forward.
