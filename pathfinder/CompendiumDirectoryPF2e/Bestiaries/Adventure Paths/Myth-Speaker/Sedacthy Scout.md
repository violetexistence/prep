Scouts, usually young sedacthies, ply the ocean in search of animal servants or tread ashore to hunt. Scouts hunting on the surface press crocodiles and snakes into service, while those underwater prefer electric eels and hippocampi.

* * *

Sedacthies are amphibious, fish-like humanoids who lurk in Golarion's oceans and are known for leading their animal servants ashore to devour air breathers. When an entire fishing village disappears overnight, sedacthies are the first suspects. Sedacthies pride themselves as natural leaders, with ambition limited only by their strict adherence to hierarchy. A sedacthy's station is determined by the strength of the animal servants they press into service, and the mettle they prove during hunts and in battles against outsiders.
