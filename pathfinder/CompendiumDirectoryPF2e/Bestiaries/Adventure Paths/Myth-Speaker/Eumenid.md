While the keribos proved effective at protecting shades against those who traveled to Amneros to steal away souls, they weren't enough of a deterrent to prevent larger incursions. In response, Amnerion created eumenids for a new purpose: to track down and punish those who invaded and stole souls or memories from Amneros. Driven by a deep protectiveness of the shades, they react with fury against any who would do them harm. Able to follow their quarry across dimensional boundaries, eumenids track down their targets or speak words of vengeance no matter the distance.

Eumenids can be found in the skies of Amneros, constantly on the lookout for danger to the shades. They're occasionally tasked to capture a shade who has become a problem or wandered off. Most eumenids appear to be feathery-winged humans outfitted in leather armor.

Places in the afterlife are constantly under threat from those who seek the souls of the deceased for their own uses. Most realms in the Outer Sphere, however, have denizens who are tasked with guarding against such threat. Although psychopomps are best known for this task, even demons greedily protect the souls hoarded in the Outer Rifts. Other pockets of reality, such as Amneros, house great numbers of shades with fewer defenses aside from the ruler of the realm themself.

## Guardian Creation

To protect the vulnerable shades of Amneros, Amnerion created specialized guardians adapted to the particular environment of their realm. These creatures, called stygian guardians, serve primarily as deterrent against unwelcome visitors, although they're sometimes tasked with capturing or redirecting wandering shades.

## Other Stygian Guardians

While keribos and eumenids are the most frequently encountered stygian guardians, they're far from the only ones. Amnerion also created multi-armed giants called thalisons to carry out jobs requiring great strength and serve as protectors of their palace, although these giants spend most of their time melded into the cavern walls. Within Bothrios, horrid half-mantis, half-scorpion creatures called scynoxthis mete out punishments to the wicked.
