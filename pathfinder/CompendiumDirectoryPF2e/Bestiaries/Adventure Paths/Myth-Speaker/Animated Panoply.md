Variant animated armor

Suits of animated armor see use both as guardians and as training partners in high-end martial academies able to afford the extravagance. Often, a warrior's old suit of armor can be turned into animated armor once it accrues too much battle damage to provide adequate protection. They're found most often in wizard laboratories and ancient dungeons.

Granted a semblance of life through the use of rituals or other strange magic, animated objects take many forms and serve a variety of uses. A few examples of typical animated objects are listed below. Many of these creatures serve as guardians, surprising unsuspecting adventurers when they suddenly attack. Others serve as idle distractions for the exceptionally rich, simple servants created to handle odd jobs, and the like.
