  - name: "Spell Circle"
    desc: " (mental) By performing an hour-long ritual, an elemental vessel can form a spell circle with an arcane or primal spellcaster. After the spell circle is formed, other spellcasters can join the spell circle by performing the same hour-long ritual while assisted by at least one spellcaster already in the spell circle. Each member of the spell circle must contribute at least one spell to the elemental vessel. The spellcaster permanently loses access to a spell slot equal to the spell's rank and the elemental vessel adds the contributed spell to its list of arcane innate spells (regardless of the spell's original type). An elemental vessel can be imbued with no more than three spells per spell rank. If the elemental vessel is destroyed, all members of the spell circle regain the spell slots they contributed to the creature. The arcane innate spells shown below represent a typical spell list for an elemental vessel, but each elemental vessel is likely to have different spells depending on what its spell circle has contributed."

Only one creature can inhabit an elemental vessel at a time."

    desc: "`pf2:2`  `DC 35 Reflex check` save, no damage, [[Actions/Escape|Escape]] DC 35, Rupture 28\n* * *\n\nThe monster Strides up to double its Speed and can move through the spaces of any creatures in its path. Any creature of the monster's size or smaller whose space the monster moves through can attempt a Reflex save with the listed DC to avoid being engulfed. A creature unable to act automatically critically fails this save. If a creature succeeds at its save, it can choose to be either pushed aside (out of the monster's path) or pushed in front of the monster to the end of the monster's movement. The monster can attempt to Engulf the same creature only once in a single use of Engulf. The monster can contain as many creatures as can fit in its space.\n\nA creature that fails its save is pulled into the monster's body. It is [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]], is [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]], and has to hold its breath or start suffocating. The creature takes the listed amount of damage when first engulfed and at the end of each of its turns while it's engulfed. An engulfed creature can get free by [[Actions/Escape|Escaping]] against the listed escape DC. An engulfed creature can attack the monster engulfing it, but only with unarmed attacks or with weapons of light Bulk or less. The engulfing creature is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] against the attack. If the monster takes piercing or slashing damage equaling or exceeding the listed Rupture value from a single attack or spell, the engulfed creature cuts itself free.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Engulf and Swallow Whole|Effect: Engulf and Swallow Whole]]\n\nA creature that gets free by either method can immediately breathe and exits the swallowing monster's space.\n\nIf the monster dies, all creatures it has engulfed are automatically released as the monster's form loses cohesion."
