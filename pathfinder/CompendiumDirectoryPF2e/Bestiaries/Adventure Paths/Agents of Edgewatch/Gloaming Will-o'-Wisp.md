    desc: " (aura,light,mental) 30 feet. Similar to other will-o'-wisps, a gloaming will-o'-wisp is naturally invisible, but glows with a faint colored light. They cast dim light in the aura, which makes them visible. In addition, any non-aberration creature that ends their turn in the aura and can see the gloaming will-o'-wisp is distracted by the gloaming will-o'-wisp's glow and must attempt a `DC 31 Will check` save. On a failure, the creature is [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] for 1 round and takes 3d6 mental damage."

If they use their shock attack while invisible, the arc of electricity lets any observer determine their location, making the will-o'-wisp only [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] to observers until they move."
