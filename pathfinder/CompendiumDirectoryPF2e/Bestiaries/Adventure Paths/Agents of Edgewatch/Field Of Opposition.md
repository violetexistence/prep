  - name: "Mirror Duplicate"
    desc: "passive A mirror duplicate rolls initiative with a +45 modifier. It uses the same statistics as the original creature, but with a +2 status bonus to AC, attacks, and saving throws. The duplicate is evil, and any abilities reliant on alignment change accordingly. The duplicate is also aggressive, attacking and taking other hostile actions available to it against anyone other than mirror duplicates.\n\nIt has three actions and one reaction and can use any of the original creature's abilities. Any limited-use abilities (such as spell slots) are based on what the original had when duplicated and are used up separately from the original creature's. The duplicate also has duplicates of the creature's worn and held items, but not consumables.\n\nA duplicate is destroyed when reduced to 0 HP, when the trap is disabled or destroyed, or when the duplicate leaves area E2. Its duplicated items disappear when they leave its grip, though they last long enough for ranged Strikes."
