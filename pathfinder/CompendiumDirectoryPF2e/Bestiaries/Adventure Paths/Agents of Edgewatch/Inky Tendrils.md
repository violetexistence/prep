    desc: "action (arcane) The inky tendrils cast a 10th-rank [[Spells/Duplicate Foe|Duplicate Foe]] spell (`DC 40 Fortitude check`) on the target; on a failed save, a simulacrum of the target made from dripping ink and clockwork scraps emerges from any other spot (tendrils' choice) in the lake.\n\nThe tendrils don't need to Sustain the Spell; the duplicate exists for 1 minute or until it is destroyed before collapsing into a puddle of ink and scrap metal."

  - name: "Grab"
    desc: "action **Requirements** The monster's last action was a successful Strike that lists Grab in its damage entry, or the monster has a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]\n* * *\n\n**Effect** If used after a Strike, the monster attempts to [[Actions/grapple|grapple]] the creature using the body part it attacked with. This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

  - name: "Routine"
    desc: "(6 actions) The hazard loses 1 action for every tentacle that is disabled or destroyed. The tentacles can combine their actions to use the hazard's Inky Imitator ability. A broken tentacle can still Strike, but it can't Grab. This hazard takes no multiple attack penalty."
