    desc: "`pf2:2` (manipulate) The poison eater uses an Interact action to draw a dose of poison and eats it, gaining strength.\n\nThe poison-eater's Strikes deal two weapon dice of damage rather than one. The poison eater is affected by the consumed poison normally and, therefore, usually chooses poisons mitigated by their poison resistance and toxin-inured ability.\n\nAt the end of each of their turns, the poison eater attempts a `DC 17 Flat check` check; on a success, this ability ends."

While in a frenzy, the poison eater gains a +1 status bonus to attack rolls with melee Strikes, gains a +4 status bonus to damage rolls with melee Strikes, gains 20 temporary Hit Points until the end of the frenzy, and takes a -2 status penalty to AC. The poison eater can't voluntarily end their frenzy. After their frenzy, the poison eater is fatigued.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Poison Frenzy|Effect: Poison Frenzy]]"
