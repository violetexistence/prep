  - name: "Entropy Sense (Imprecise) 60 feet"
    desc: " (divine,prediction) An overdrive imentesh can anticipate the most likely location of a creature through their supernatural insight into the forces of chaotic probabilities and chance. This grants the overdrive imentesh the ability to sense creatures within the listed range.\n\nThe overdrive imentesh's entropy sense doesn't detect creatures under the effects of [[Spells/Veil of Privacy|Veil of Privacy]] or that are otherwise shielded from divinations and predictions."

  - name: "Protean Anatomy"
    desc: " (divine) A overdrive imentesh's vital organs shift and change shape and position constantly.\n\nImmediately after the hegessik takes acid, electricity, or sonic damage, it gains the listed amount of resistance to that damage type. This lasts for 1 hour or until the next time the protean takes damage of one of the other types (in which case its resistance changes to match that type), whichever comes first.\n\nThe overdrive imentesh is immune to polymorph effects unless it is a willing target. If [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] or [[Conditions/Deafened|Deafened]], the overdrive imentesh automatically recovers at the end of its next turn as new sensory organs grow to replace the compromised ones."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Change Shape|Change Shape]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,divine,polymorph) The imentesh takes the appearance of any Large or smaller creature. This doesn't change its Speed or its attack and damage bonuses with its Strikes, but it might change the damage type its Strikes deal.\n* * *\n\nThe monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Grab|Grab]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** The monster's last action was a successful Strike that lists Grab in its damage entry, or the monster has a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]\n* * *\n\n**Effect** If used after a Strike, the monster attempts to [[Actions/grapple|grapple]] the creature using the body part it attacked with. This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."
