    desc: "(1 action) On its turn, the bomb spews forth a smoky gout of airborne [[Equipment/Blackfinger Blight|Blackfinger Blight]] poison. The cloud fills a 20-foot radius, or a 10-foot radius if only one tank remains intact. If the bomb is already in the center of a blackfinger blight cloud, the radius of that cloud increases by 20 feet (or 10 feet, if only one tank remains intact) instead."

    desc: "The trap issues smoke for 3 minutes before its tanks run dry. The tanks must be replaced before the bomb can be reactivated."
