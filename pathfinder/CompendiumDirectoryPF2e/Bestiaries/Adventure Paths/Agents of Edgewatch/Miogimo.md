For the purposes of rejuvenation, a follower is defined as an intelligent creature who's well acquainted with Miogimo and is a true believer in Miogimo's mission, not merely a lukewarm supporter. Miogimo can be permanently destroyed only if he has no current followers or can be convinced to end his own life."

Creatures under Miogimo's _geas_ have their maximum HP reduced by 10 each day until they are burned away to a husk and perish. After 24 hours, such creatures rise as zeal-damned ghouls under Miogimo's control. Zeal-damned ghouls eat only the flesh of evil or chaotic creatures and deal an additional 1d6 spirit and 1d6 void damage with their attacks."
