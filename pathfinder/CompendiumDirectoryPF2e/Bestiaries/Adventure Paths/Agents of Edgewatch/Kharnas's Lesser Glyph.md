If the creature is undead, it takes 10d10 vitality damage. If it's living, it instead regains 10d10 healing Hit Points. It then must succeed at a `DC 40 Will check` save or be affected by a 6th-rank [[Spells/Dominate|Dominate]] spell.\n\nThe spell commands the affected creature to attack the nearest creature who doesn't bear the sigil of Kharnas."
