  - name: "Surface-Bound"
    desc: "  A living mural can move only along flat surfaces such as floors and walls. This allows it to end its movement wrapped around corners when on a continuous surface.\n\nIf the surface it's on is destroyed (such as a portrait hit by a fireball spell or a puddle being splashed), the mural takes 10d6 damage and is shunted to the nearest flat surface. If there is no flat surface within 5 feet, the living mural is destroyed."
