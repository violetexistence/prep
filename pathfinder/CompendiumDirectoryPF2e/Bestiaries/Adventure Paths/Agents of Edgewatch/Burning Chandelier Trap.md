The chandeliers drop several feet on elongated chains, allowing them to swing around the room. The closest chandelier to the triggering creature makes a swinging chandelier Strike against it. The trap then rolls initiative."

    desc: "(4 actions) For every chandelier disabled, the trap's actions are reduced by 1. For each of the trap's actions, a different chandelier attacks a random creature in the room. A chandelier uses its swinging chandelier attack if it can, but it can't make melee attacks against creatures in the cage, the closet, or the gap between the two double doors leading into the vault. Against a creature it can't reach with a melee attack, it uses a flame dart attack instead. The trap doesn't take multiple attack penalties."

    desc: "The trap deactivates and resets 1 minute after there are no living creatures remaining in the room."
