    desc: "(1 action) Each round on its initiative count, the trap pumps more toxic gas into the room.\n\nAny breathing creature in the room takes 4d6 poison damage (a successful `DC 22 Fortitude check` save halves the damage taken). If a creature acts before the trap on the first round, it has the option of holding its breath to postpone taking damage from the trap-holding one's breath after the trap's first action has no effect, since the air in the creature's lungs is already tainted. Locating and blocking one of the hidden gas vents reduces the poison damage by 1d6-if all four are blocked, the trap is disabled, though the door remains locked. Otherwise, the trap functions for 1 minute before all the gas is expended and characters in the room cease taking damage, after which the trap ventilates the room for 1 additional minute."

    desc: "The trap must be manually rearmed by unblocking the vents or replacing the poison gas tank in area **E30**."
