Any adjacent creature that attempts a melee attack against the avarek takes 1d6 piercing damage per attack, regardless of whether the attack hits.\n\nPrickly Defense lasts until the avarek uses a move action or makes a Strike with any weapon other than its spines."

The avarek Strides twice and makes up to two spine Strikes at any point during its movement, each against a different target within reach.\n\nThese attacks count toward the avarek's multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after the avarek makes all the attacks."
