    desc: "`pf2:1`  1d4+4 bludgeoning damage, `DC 16 Fortitude check`\n* * *\n\nThe monster deals the listed amount of damage to any number of creatures [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]] by it. Each of those creatures can attempt a basic Fortitude save with the listed DC."

  - name: "Control Body"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** The shredskin is adjacent to a Medium or Small humanoid-shaped corpse\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The shredskin wraps itself around the corpse and takes control of the host body. While controlling a host, the shredskin uses the host's Speed but its own attacks, and it loses its Grab and Enshroud abilities.\n\nAttacks that target the shredskin while it controls a body deal half of the damage to the shredskin and half of the damage to the host body. Attacks that target an area deal damage to both the shredskin and host body normally.\n\nThe shredskin can release the host body as a free action at the start of its turn. If the host is destroyed, the shredskin automatically releases the body and is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] for 1 round. A Medium corpse typically has 15 hit points, while a Small corpse typically has 10 Hit Points.\n\nCreatures can notice that a corpse is controlled by a shredskin by succeeding a Perception check against the shredskin's Deception DC."

  - name: "Enshroud"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** The shredskin is grabbing a creature\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The shredskin attempts to pin the creature and wrap itself around the creature like a shirt. The shredskin rolls an `Athletics check` check against the creature's Fortitude DC.\n\nOn a success, the creature becomes [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]] and the shredskin can take control of the creature as if using Control Body.\n\nAt the start of its turn, the shredskin can automatically Constrict the enshrouded creature as a free action.\n\nAn enshrouded creature can attempt a DC 16 [[Actions/Escape|Escape]] check to break free (DC 18 if the shredskin critically succeeded its Athletics check to Enshroud)."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Grab|Grab]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** The monster's last action was a successful Strike that lists Grab in its damage entry, or the monster has a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]\n* * *\n\n**Effect** If used after a Strike, the monster attempts to [[Actions/grapple|grapple]] the creature using the body part it attacked with. This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."
