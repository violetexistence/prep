For the next 24 hours, the affected target takes a -2 circumstance penalty (-3 on a critical failure) to additional Fortitude saving throws against the same chemist's Crude Bombs.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Dirty Bomb|Effect: Dirty Bomb]]\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Dirty Bomb (Critical Failure)|Effect: Dirty Bomb (Critical Failure)]]"
