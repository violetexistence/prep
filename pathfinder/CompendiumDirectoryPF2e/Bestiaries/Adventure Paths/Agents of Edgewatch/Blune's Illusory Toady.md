    desc: "`pf2:r`  **Trigger** A creature within the monster's reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The monster attempts a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, the monster disrupts that action. This Strike doesn't count toward the monster's multiple attack penalty, and its multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike."

    desc: " (arcane) When an illusory toady is destroyed, it dissolves into a puddle of cerulean quintessence before reforming to quasi-life once more. One round after it is destroyed, the toady starts re-forming. One round after that, the toady is completely healed and begins to fight once more.\n\nIf damaged while it is re-forming but before the process is complete, the toady is destroyed but splits into two cerulean puddles that begin re-forming into two identical toadies 1 round later, each with half the maximum HP of the original toady (this is similar to an [[Bestiary 1/Ochre Jelly|Ochre Jelly's]] Split ability); the toadies begin re-forming 1 round later.\n\nThe toadies are permanently destroyed only by [[Spells/Disjunction|Disjunction]] or if [[Agents of Edgewatch/Blune Bandersworth|Blune]] falls unconscious."

    desc: "`pf2:3` (arcane) The toady wills itself to become a conduit for Blune's next spell, empowering the spell.\n\nThe toady becomes [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] until the beginning of its next turn.\n\nIf Blune Bandersworth is within 30 feet and Casts a Spell before the toady's next turn, the spell travels through the toady before redirecting toward its intended target.\n\nThe spell is heightened by 1 rank, to a maximum of 10th rank. The toady is then destroyed."
