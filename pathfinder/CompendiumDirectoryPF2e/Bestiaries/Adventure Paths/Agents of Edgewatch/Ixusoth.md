Ixusoth can see through all of her eye probes. She can move the probes all in separate directions using a single action. Ixusoth can have no more than six eye probes active at a time; using this ability to create more eyes causes the eye or eyes farthest away to shrivel and die.\n\nIxusoth can deliver touch spells through her eye probes and make melee spell attacks through them. In addition, she can Steal Memories through an eye probe using a single action by touching the target with the eye."

  - name: "Steal Memories"
    desc: "`pf2:3` (emotion,mental,occult) Ixusoth reaches out with her mind and attempts to steal memories from a creature within 30 feet. The target must succeed at a `DC 40 Will check` saving throw or become [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] and have some of its memories stolen. When Ixusoth steals memories, she learns some of the creature's memories (chosen by the GM). These memories are then lost to that creature."
