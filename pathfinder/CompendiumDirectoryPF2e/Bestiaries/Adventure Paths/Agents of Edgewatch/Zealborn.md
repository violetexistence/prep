    desc: " (mental,occult) Each time a creature willingly performs a service, quest, or task for the zealborn, the creature takes a cumulative -1 status penalty to saving throws against the zealborn's mental spells and abilities (maximum -4)."

  - name: "Rejuvenation"
    desc: " (occult) When a zealborn is destroyed, it re-forms, fully healed, near a follower of its choice in 1d10 days. For the purposes of rejuvenation, a follower is defined as an intelligent creature who's well acquainted with the zealborn and is a true believer in the zealborn's mission, not merely a lukewarm supporter. A zealborn can be permanently destroyed only if they have no current followers or can be convinced to end their own life."

  - name: "Zealous Restoration"
    desc: "  A zealborn can't regain Hit Points through resting or void healing; they feed only on the idealism of their supporters, regaining 10 Hit Points per day for each creature under the effects of a _geas_ cast by the zealborn. Creatures under a zealborn's _geas_ have their maximum HP reduced by 10 each day until they are burned away to a husk and perish. After 24 hours, such creatures rise as zeal-damned ghouls under the zealborn's control. Zeal-damned ghouls eat only the flesh of evil or chaotic creatures and deal an additional 1d6 spirit and 1d6 void damage with their attacks."
