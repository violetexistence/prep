  - name: "Quick Stitch"
    desc: "`pf2:2`  **Requirements** The Skinsaw seamer is currently grappling a creature\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The seamer stitches a piece of cloth to the creature's arm, face, or leg, potentially hindering it. The creature must attempt a `DC 26 Reflex check` saving throw; if the seamer has already successfully used their Flay ability against the creature within the past minute, the creature's save result is one degree of success worse.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature takes 1d4 piercing damage.\n\n**Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]], [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]], [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]], or [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] (seamer's choice). This effect lasts until the creature spends a single action to tear out the stitching, which deals 1d6 piercing damage to it.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 2]], [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]], [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 2]], or off-guard (seamer's choice). This effect lasts until the creature spends 2 actions to tear out the stitching, which deals 2d6 piercing damage to it."
