    desc: "  When Gage gets a critical success using the [[Actions/Lie|Lie]] action, the target's attitude toward him improves by one step, as though he'd succeeded at using Diplomacy to [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]].\n\nThis works only once per conversation, and if he critically succeeds against multiple targets using the same result, he chooses one creature's attitude to improve.\n\nTo use this ability, Gage must be lying to impart seemingly important information, inflate his status, or ingratiate himself, which trivial or irrelevant lies can't achieve."

  - name: "Smooth Operator"
    desc: "  When Gage meets a group of up to five people, he can immediately attempt a Diplomacy check to [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]], comparing the result to the Will DC of each target.\n\nHe takes a -3 penalty on this check, and it is possible to get different degrees of success for each target. If he fails or critically fails, he can engage in 1 minute of conversation and attempt a new check at the end of that time rather than accepting the failure or critical failure result."
