    desc: "  Tremorsense allows a monster to feel the vibrations through a solid surface caused by movement. It is an imprecise sense with a limited range (listed in the ability). Tremorsense functions only if the monster is on the same surface as the subject, and only if the subject is moving along (or burrowing through) the surface."

After this exposure, light doesn't blind the monster again until after it spends 1 hour in darkness. However, as long as the monster is in an area of bright light, it's [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]]."

  - name: "Illusory Persona"
    desc: "  The illusion created by the myrucarx's _project image_ can resemble any Medium humanoid, including any specific individual it has seen, and has appropriate voice, scent, and mannerisms, allowing the myrucarx to use its Deception check to Impersonate that humanoid if it chooses."

  - name: "Twisting Reach"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Frequency** once per round\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The fanged mouths at the ends of a myrucarx's tendrils twist around obstacles. The myrucarx makes two jaws Strikes against the same target, ignoring the target's cover. Both attacks count toward the myrucarx's multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after both attacks are made. The myrucarx can't Grab as its next action after Twisting Reach."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Grab|Grab]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** The monster's last action was a successful Strike that lists Grab in its damage entry, or the monster has a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]\n* * *\n\n**Effect** If used after a Strike, the monster attempts to [[Actions/grapple|grapple]] the creature using the body part it attacked with. This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."
