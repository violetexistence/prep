    desc: "`pf2:r`  **Trigger** A creature within the monster's reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The monster attempts a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, the monster disrupts that action. This Strike doesn't count toward the monster's multiple attack penalty, and its multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike."

    desc: "`pf2:1` (flourish) Shristi makes two unarmed Strikes. If both hit the same creature, combine their damage for the purposes of resistances and weaknesses.

    desc: "`pf2:1` (electricity,sonic) **Frequency** twice per day\n* * *\n\n**Effect** With a loud shout, Shristi unleashes his ki as a crackling shroud of thunder and lightning that engulfs his body. Until the end of his next turn, Shristi's unarmed Strikes and Strikes with weapons that have the monk trait deal an additional 3 electricity damage and 3 sonic damage."

  - name: "Sky and Heaven Stance"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (stance) Shristi enters a combat stance perfected by past champions of the Challenge of Sky and Heaven. While in this stance, the only Strikes Shristi can make are skyward slash unarmed attacks. These deal 1d10 slashing damage; are in the brawling group; and have the nonlethal, unarmed, and versatile P traits.\n\nWhile in Sky and Heaven Stance, Shristi gains resistance 2 to electricity and sonic damage."
