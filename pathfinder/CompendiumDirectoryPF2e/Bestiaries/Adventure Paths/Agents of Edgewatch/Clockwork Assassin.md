    desc: "`pf2:r`  **Trigger** A creature within the monster's reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The monster attempts a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, the monster disrupts that action. This Strike doesn't count toward the monster's multiple attack penalty, and its multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike."

  - name: "Integrated Launcher"
    desc: "  A projectile launcher is integrated into a clockwork assassin's systems, containing 10 spinning blades and five smoke bombs. When the assassin is destroyed, the launcher and its ammunition are also destroyed."

  - name: "Smoke Vision"
    desc: "  The clockwork assassin ignores the concealed condition from smoke."

  - name: "Wind-Up"
    desc: "  For the clockwork assassin to act, it must be wound with a unique key by another creature. This takes 1 minute. Once wound, it remains operational for 24 hours, after which time it becomes unaware of its surroundings and can't act until it's wound again. The assassin can enter standby mode as a 3-action activity. Its operational time doesn't decrease in standby, but it can sense its surroundings (with a -2 penalty to Perception). It can't act, with one exception: when it perceives a creature, it can exit standby as a reaction (rolling initiative if appropriate).A creature can attempt a [[Actions/disable-device dc=31|disable-device dc=31]]{DC 31 Thievery} check to Disable a Device to wind the assassin down. For each success, the assassin loses 1 hour of operational time. This can be done even if the assassin is in standby mode."
