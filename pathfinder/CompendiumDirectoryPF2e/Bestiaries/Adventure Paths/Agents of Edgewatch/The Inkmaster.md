  - name: "Improved Grab"
    desc: "  **Requirements** The monster's last action was a success with a Strike that lists Improved Grab in its damage entry, or it has a creature grabbed using this action.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The monster automatically Grabs the target until the end of the monster's next turn. The creature is grabbed by whichever body part the monster attacked with, and that body part can't be used to Strike creatures until the grab is ended. Using Improved Grab extends the duration of the monster's Improved Grab until the end of its next turn for all creatures grabbed by it, but this costs an action. A grabbed creature can use the Escape action to get out of the grab, and the Grab ends for a grabbed creatures if the monster moves away from it."

Male variant shemhazian

Shemhazians rise from the souls of torturers and those who reveled in mutilating the physical bodies of their victims. Standing 35 feet tall, a shemhazian is well equipped with a wide range of talons, claws, and fangs to continue inflicting such torments on those it encounters.

Shemhazians delight in visiting torment upon mortals, of course, but more than most demons, these fiends revel in sharing the pain with their own kind. Other demons fear and hate shemhazians for this reason, with only the most powerful willing to work with a shemhazian to achieve a shared goal. Even then, the shemhazian is always on the watch for an opportunity to bring pain and suffering to its allies along with any foe.
