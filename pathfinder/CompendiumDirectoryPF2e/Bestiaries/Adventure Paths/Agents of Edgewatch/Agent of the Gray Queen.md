If a Small or larger living creature dies within its aura, the astradaemon gains 5 temporary Hit Points and a +1 status bonus to attack and damage rolls for 1 round, unless the creature was slain by an astradaemon's Devour Soul ability.\n\nIncorporeal undead and living spirits traveling outside the body take 1d8 force damage each round within the daemon's aura from the spiritual pressure as the astradaemon pulls in fragments of their soul.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Soul Siphon|Effect: Soul Siphon]]"

    desc: " (divine,void) When an astradaemon hits with its claw, jaws, or tail, it drains the target's spiritual and vital essences.\n\nThe target takes 2d10 void damage and the astradaemon regains an equal number of Hit Points. The target must succeed at a `DC 37 Fortitude check` save or become [[Conditions/Doomed|Doomed 1]] and [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]].\n\nIf the target was already drained or doomed, it instead increases both conditions' value by 1, to a maximum of 4."

  - name: "Mortal Shell"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (divine) **Requirements** The astradaemon has killed a Large or smaller creature with Overtake Soul within the past 24 hours and that creature is within the daemon's reach\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The astradaemon takes over and wears the body of their victim. This automatically creates a disguise to allow the astradaemon to Impersonate the target creature. The body has a number of Hit Points equal to 3 times the level of the creature. Any damage targeting the astradaemon damages the body first. Once the body is reduced to 0 Hit Points, it's destroyed and forces the astradaemon out, back to the daemon's normal form. If the astradaemon takes any spirit damage while wearing the body, the damage is dealt to the astradaemon directly and it must succeed at a `DC 5 Flat check` check or be forced out of the body. Additionally, [[Spells/Disjunction|Disjunction]] and [[Spells/Dispel Magic|Dispel Magic]] can force the astradaemon out of the body with a successful counteract check against DC 41.\n\nWhile wearing the disguise, the astradaemon's attacks use the reach of the body it inhabits, and its size changes to match that of the creature whose soul it consumed. Additionally, the astradaemon is [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 2]] and [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 4]] while wearing the disguise. (These penalties haven't been incorporated into this stat block.)"

  - name: "Overtake Soul"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (death,divine,incapacitation) **Requirements** The astradaemon hasn't used an action with the attack trait yet this turn.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The astradaemon draws out and consumes the soul of a living creature it has [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]]. The creature must succeed at a `DC 39 Fortitude check` save or instantly die. If it dies, the astradaemon gains 10 temporary Hit Points.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Overtake Soul|Effect: Overtake Soul]]"

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Grab|Grab]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** The monster's last action was a successful Strike that lists Grab in its damage entry, or the monster has a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]\n* * *\n\n**Effect** If used after a Strike, the monster attempts to [[Actions/grapple|grapple]] the creature using the body part it attacked with. This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."
