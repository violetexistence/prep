  - name: "Rejuvenation"
    desc: " (divine) When a graveknight is destroyed, its armor rebuilds its body over the course of 1d10 days-or more quickly if the armor is worn by a living host. If the body is destroyed before then, the process restarts.\n\nA graveknight can only be permanently destroyed by obliterating its armor (such as with [[Spells/Disintegrate|Disintegrate]]), transporting it to the Forge of Creation, or throwing it into the heart of a volcano."
