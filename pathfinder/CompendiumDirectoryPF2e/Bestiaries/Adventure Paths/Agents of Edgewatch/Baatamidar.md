    desc: "  This monster regains the listed number of Hit Points each round at the beginning of its turn. Its [[Conditions/Dying|Dying]] condition never increases beyond Dying 3 as long as its regeneration is active. However, if it takes damage of a type listed in the regeneration entry, its regeneration deactivates until the end of its next turn. Deactivate the regeneration before applying any damage of a listed type, since that damage might kill the monster by bringing it to Dying 4."

Creatures who start their turn in the aura must succeed at a `DC 48 Will check` save or become unable to understand any communication (including telepathy), distinguish social rank or authority, or differentiate the relative value of objects or services. This persists for as long as the creature is in the aura.\n\nCreatures who succeed at the save are temporarily immune for 1 hour (24 hours on a critical success). Proteans are immune to the unrelativity field.\n\nThe baatamidar can suppress this aura or activate it again as a free action."

    desc: "`pf2:2`  The baatamidar makes up to four tentacle Strikes, each against a different target.

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead spend an action to use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

Baatamidars are drawn to destroy planar communities on the fringes where the Outer Planes touch the chaos of the Maelstrom. They resemble floating blobs of undulating, prismatic ooze with four quivering tentacles and dribbles of oily slime that always drip upwards.
