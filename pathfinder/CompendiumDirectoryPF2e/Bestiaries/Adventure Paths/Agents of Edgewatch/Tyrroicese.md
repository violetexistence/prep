  - name: "Rallying Call"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (occult) When Tyrroicese subsumed Corporal Quordein, it gained a perverted form of the commander's ability to rally allies.\n\nThe first time Tyrroicese uses this ability, it summons an [[Bestiary 1/Ochre Jelly|Ochre Jelly]], which leaks out of the ceiling of area D13 and drops to the floor to join the fight, siding with Tyrroicese.\n\nThereafter, when Tyrroicese uses this ability, any oozes within 60 feet become [[Conditions/Quickened|Quickened]] for 1 round (the oozes can use their extra action only to Stride) and, if they're not allied with the agents, the oozes ally themselves with Tyrroicese."

  - name: "Subsume"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (incapacitation) Tyrroicese lifts an adjacent dying creature with its pseudopods and subsumes that creature into its own oozy flesh. The subsumed creature's dying value does not increase, though it can't decrease either.\n\nTyrroicese regains 30 healing HP and also gains the ability to use one or two of the subsumed creature's special abilities or feats, subject to the GM's discretion.\n\nA creature adjacent to Tyrroicese can extract a subsumed creature by spending 2 actions to attempt a `DC 29 Athletics check` check.\n\nOn a success, the subsumed creature is pulled from Tyrroicese and falls into the nearest available space."
