    desc: "`DC 34 Thievery check` (master) to disable a specific statue's rollers, or `DC 39 Thievery check` (master) on the control panel in **A4** deactivates the whole trap. For each statue disabled, the trap loses 1 action from its routine and the DC for its predictive impediment ability decreases by 4. [[Spells/Dispel Magic|Dispel Magic]] (7th rank, counteract DC 32) doesn't harm the statues but removes the predictive impediment ability. Breaking the control panel prevents the trap from resetting."

    desc: "passive (arcane) The statues continually slide around to bump into creatures and block their passage through the room. The first time on its turn that a creature attempts to move within the room, it must succeed at a `DC 36 Reflex check` save or treat the entire room as difficult terrain for 1 round. On a critical failure, the creature is also knocked prone."
