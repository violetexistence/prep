Elite redcap

Redcaps are sadistic and capricious fey who thrill in bloodletting and murder. While they are most famous for appearing as wizened, bearded men, redcaps of other genders are no less fearsome or cruel. However, redcaps are ultimately craven bullies, cowed by anything more powerful than themselves, a trait that leads them to fear and despise the symbols of deities.

Many fairy tales explain how the redcaps draw power from dipping the hats for which they are named in fresh blood. Just as iconic to these cruel little fey are their iron-clad boots, and the clanging sound of their metal soles clanking on stone floors is both discordant and disconcerting—especially to those who recognize the sound for what it is. Redcaps typically stand only 3 feet tall, with hunched frames, pointed ears, crooked teeth, and long, white, tangled hair.

Though unlikely to share true affection, redcaps find camaraderie in murder. Small troupes of redcaps travel together, sharing bloody kills and reminiscing on their brutal exploits. They loathe the company of most other creatures, with the notable exception of the feline fey called elananxes.
