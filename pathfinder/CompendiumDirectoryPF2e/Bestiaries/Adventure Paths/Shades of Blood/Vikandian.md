    desc: "  n addition to the typical vampire vulnerabilities, Vikandian is jealous he can't create spawn. A PC who pokes at this shame when they attempt to [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] Vikandian gains a +4 circumstance bonus on their Intimidation check. If they're successful, Vikandian becomes [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] for as long as he remains frightened as he sputters in rage.\n\n*   **Revulsion** A nosferatu can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of brandished garlic or a brandished religious symbol of a non-evil deity. To brandish garlic or a religious symbol, a creature must Interact to do so for 1 round (similar to Raising a Shield). If the nosferatu involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of their revulsion, they gain the [[Conditions/Fleeing|Fleeing]] condition, running from the object of their revulsion until they end an action beyond 10 feet. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of their revulsion, a nosferatu can attempt a `DC 25 Will check` save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, they overcome their revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success).\n*   **Stake** A magical wooden stake (such as one affected by a weapon potency rune, magic weapon, or similar magic) driven through the nosferatu's heart drops the nosferatu to 0 HP and prevents them from healing above 0 HP, even in their coffin. Staking a nosferatu requires 3 actions and works only if the nosferatu is [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]]. If the stake is removed, the nosferatu can heal above 0 HP again, and if they're in their coffin, the 1-hour rest period begins once the stake is removed. If the nosferatu's head is severed and anointed with _[[Equipment/Holy Water|Holy Water]]_ while the stake is in place, the nosferatu is destroyed.\n*   **Sunlight** If exposed to direct sunlight, a nosferatu immediately becomes [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]]. The slowed value increases by 1 each time the nosferatu ends their turn in sunlight, and the condition ends when they're no longer in sunlight. If the nosferatu loses all their actions in this way, they're destroyed."

  - name: "Opportune Riposte"
    desc: "`pf2:r`  **Trigger** An enemy within Vikandian's reach critically fails on a Strike against him\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Vikandian either makes a melee Strike against the triggering enemy or attempts to [[Actions/Disarm|Disarm]] them of the weapon used for the Strike. If he succeeds, he gains panache."

    desc: " (divine,void) If he's reduced to 0 HP, Vikandian disperses into an immense number of individual rats that flee in every direction in an attempt to return to his coffin in area **N6**. If even a single rat enters this coffin, he reforms in his body and is [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]]. If his body rests in his coffin for 1 hour, Vikandian gains 1 HP, after which his fast healing begins to function normally. If his coffin doesn't contain plagued grave dirt, he instead needs to rest in his coffin for 1 day before he gains 1 HP and regains his fast healing."

    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** Vikandian has panache\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Vikandian attempts a sword cane Strike. If he hits, the target also takes 3d6 persistent bleed damage. He then loses his panache and can't use actions that have the attack trait for the rest of his turn."

  - name: "[[Creature Family Ability Glossary/(Vampire, Nosferatu) Change Shape|Change Shape]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,divine,polymorph) Vikandian transforms into a swarm of rats. He gains a land Speed of 30 feet and a climb Speed of 10 feet, and he becomes Large. Each enemy in his space takes 2d10 piercing damage (`DC 26 Reflex check` save). A creature that fails the save is exposed to plague of ancients.\n* * *\n\nThe monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

    desc: " (auditory,divine,mental) **Requirements** One of Vikandian's morlock thralls is present and can hear him\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Vikandian gives a single command to one of his thralls, which the thrall follows to the best of their ability during their next turn."

  - name: "[[Creature Family Ability Glossary/(Vampire, Nosferatu) Dominate|Dominate]]"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (divine,incapacitation,mental,visual) The nosferatu can cast [[Spells/Dominate|Dominate]] at will as a divine innate spell. Casting it requires staring into the target's eyes, giving the spell the visual trait (`DC 26 Will check`). A creature that succeeds is temporarily immune to that nosferatu's Dominate for 24 hours. Fully destroying the nosferatu ends the domination, but merely reducing the nosferatu to 0 HP is insufficient to break the spell."

  - name: "[[Creature Family Ability Glossary/(Vampire, Nosferatu) Drink Blood|Drink Blood]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (divine) **Requirements** The nosferatu's last action was a successful fangs Strike\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The nosferatu sinks their fangs into the targeted creature to drink its blood. This requires an `Athletics check` check against the creature's Fortitude DC. On a success, the creature becomes [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]], and Vikandian regains 10 healing HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points and gaining panache. Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the nosferatu, but increases the creature's drained condition value by 1. A nosferatu can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but they gain no HP from doing so.\n\nThe target creature's drained condition value decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a successful `DC 20 Medicine check` check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drained value by 1 after 10 minutes."

Variant human nosferatu swashbuckler

Twisted by age and eternal hunger, nosferatu malefactors spread plague in their wake and yearn for mortal blood.

* * *

Among the most ancient of vampires are the nosferatus, twisted remnants of mortals who died in great plagues of old. Perhaps because of their age, nosferatus can no longer create more of their kind. Yet they still lurk among the living, manipulating the hearts and minds of their prey to either serve them beyond the limits of natural life or to become sustenance for the nosferatu like so many others before.
