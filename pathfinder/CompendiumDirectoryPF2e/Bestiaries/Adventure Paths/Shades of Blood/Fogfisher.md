Fogfishers are rarely encountered less than a mile above the ground, preferring instead to drift high in the atmosphere in clusters that look like drifting fog banks. Only when their favored foods—birds, bats, and other tiny flying creatures—grow scarce do fogfishers descend to feed. Fogfishers trapped in enclosed areas, such as subterranean caverns, might be forced into such tactics.

A fogfisher appears as an ovoid mass of pulsing, translucent flesh from which dangle dozens of spike-tipped tendrils. When it attacks, the fogfisher launches a harpoon-like hook. By injecting victims with its buoyant drifting toxin, a fogfisher can reel in creatures much larger than its typical vermin prey.

## Fishers Above

The fogfisher occupies a similar ecological niche as another deadly predator of the world above—the [[Howl of the Wild/Sky Fisher|Sky Fisher]]. Scholars have noted the similarities between these creatures, although enough differences remain to suggest the two are unrelated. It makes one wonder, though, what other predators might lurk in the cloud-jungles high above the ground.
