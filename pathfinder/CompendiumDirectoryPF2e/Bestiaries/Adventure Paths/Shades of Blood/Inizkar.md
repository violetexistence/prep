    desc: "  Inizkar's academic skills allow her to discover information on almost any subject. Inizkar can spend 1 week of downtime to automatically succeed at a check to [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] about a subject. If the subject is a creature, she learns the name, basic description, general behavior, and one specific ability of that creature. If the subject is a different topic, she learns general information that's always at least mildly informational and helpful.\n\nInizkar can use this ability to learn about any common topic of 8th level or lower, or any uncommon topic of 6th level or lower. She can't learn about rare topics, though the GM has the final decision on determining whether a given topic is something that Inizkar can learn about. If the topic is lower than 5th level, she reduces the time it takes to learn about the subject by 1 day per level below 5th, to a minimum of 1 day."
