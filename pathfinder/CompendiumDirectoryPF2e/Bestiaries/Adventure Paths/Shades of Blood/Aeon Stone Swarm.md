Aeon stone swarms are constructs composed of hundreds of magical gems called _aeon stones_ that orbit around a central point in a tumultuous, ever-shifting mass. Each swarm is imbued with intelligence and composed of a collection of _aeon stones_, which can arrange themselves in a variety of configurations to activate unique resonant powers. While most aeon stone swarms adopt similar configurations, it's possible to create swarms with experimental structures, resulting in different or additional resonant powers.

Many aeon stone swarms are created to protect a particular location clandestinely, with the swarm using its subterfuge resonance to disguise itself as a mosaic of precious stones or a pile of gemstones lying in an open chest. Unfortunately for would-be thieves, nearly all the _aeon stones_ composing an aeon stone swarm shatter when the swarm is destroyed.

## Aeon Stones

When an aeon stone swarm is destroyed, most of the _aeon stones_ composing its body shatter and explode, but a few remain whole. Adventurers willing to sift through mounds of sharp aeon stone shards are usually rewarded with a _consumed aeon stone_, a _preserving aeon stone_, or a _sprouting aeon stone_â€”perhaps even a _nourishing aeon stone_ or _smoothing aeon stone_ for the particularly lucky!
