    desc: "`pf2:r` **Trigger** More than 3 Small creatures or more than 1 Medium creature climbs the ladder at the same time\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The ladder's anchors rip free from the wall, dropping the ladder and anyone on it into area **B1**. Anyone on the ladder falls 50 feet, taking falling damage as appropriate. A creature at the top of the ladder can attempt a `DC 21 Acrobatics check` check or Reflex save to [[Actions/Grab an Edge|Grab an Edge]] and cling to the side of the pit in area **A9**. A creature lower on the ladder can attempt to grab a handhold on the shaft's wall, but in this case the check increases to `DC 25 Acrobatics check`."
