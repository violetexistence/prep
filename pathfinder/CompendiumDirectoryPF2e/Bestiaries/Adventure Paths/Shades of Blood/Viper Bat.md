  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Swallow Whole|Swallow Whole]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (attack) Medium, digest mind, Rupture 20\n* * *\n\nThe monster attempts to swallow a creature of the listed size or smaller that it has grabbed or restrained in its jaws or mouth. If a swallowed creature is of the maximum size listed, the monster can't use Swallow Whole again. If the creature is smaller than the maximum, the monster can usually swallow more creatures; the GM determines the maximum. The monster attempts an `Athletics check` check opposed by the grabbed creature's Reflex DC. If it succeeds, it swallows the creature. The monster's mouth or jaws no longer grab a creature it has swallowed, so the monster is free to use them to Strike or Grab once again. The monster can't attack creatures it has swallowed.\n\nA swallowed creature is [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]], is [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]], and has to hold its breath or start suffocating. The swallowed creature takes the listed amount of damage when first swallowed and at the end of each of its turns while it's swallowed. If the victim [[Actions/Escape|Escapes]] this ability's grabbed condition, it exits through the monster's mouth. This frees any other creature grabbed in the monster's mouth or jaws. A swallowed creature can attack the monster that has swallowed it, but only with unarmed attacks or with weapons of light Bulk or less. The swallowing creature is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] against the attack. If the monster takes piercing or slashing damage equaling or exceeding the listed Rupture value from a single attack or spell, the swallowed creature cuts itself free. A creature that gets free by either Escaping or cutting itself free can immediately breathe and exits the swallowing monster's space.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Engulf and Swallow Whole|Effect: Engulf and Swallow Whole]]\n\nIf the monster dies, a swallowed creature can be freed by creatures adjacent to the corpse if they spend a combined total of 3 actions cutting the monster open with a weapon or unarmed attack that deals piercing or slashing damage."

Strange creatures dwell in the lightless reaches of the Darklands. With its serpentine body, batlike wings and head, and glowing red eyes, it's hard to tell whether this creature is more bat or snake, and those who consider the viper bat a dumb beast are invariably shocked upon hearing its rasping voice. Though a viper bat's fur is naturally pale, it often appears nearly black as a result of the slick, rancid oil that oozes from the creature's flesh.

Viper bats gather in colonies where they eagerly share stories gathered from those they feed upon, for to be digested by a viper bat is to surrender your secrets to them. Scholars wonder if this eerie side effect points to some ancient link to a ghoul's ability to retain knowledge from the bodies of those they eat, though in the case of a viper bat, once a creature is dead, it can no longer transfer its memories to them. In fact, dead flesh is unpalatable to a viper bat—they crave only living bodies, regurgitating their food into deep crevasses that serve as middens once they can no longer absorb knowledge from a meal.

## Friends to Undeath

Although living, viper bats have a strong affinity with undeath. They are healed by void energy and share many immunities with the undead. Ghouls and vampires have a particular fondness for viper bats, with the latter often feeding their viper bat allies living prisoners who refuse to give up their secrets, in hopes that the viper bat digests those hidden truths.
