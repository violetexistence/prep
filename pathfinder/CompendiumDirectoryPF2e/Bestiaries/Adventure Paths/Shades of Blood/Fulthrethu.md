The sinister fulthrethu often appears as nothing more than a tangle of flotsam and kelp drifting on the currents or washed onto shore. At least, until the fulthrethu attacks, at which point its true appearance—that of a manta-ray-like creature with a suckered tail, toothy maw, and a dozen orange eyes—becomes clear.

Alghollthus created the first fulthrethus eons ago to serve a unique role—to beguile unsuspecting creatures via frighteningly realistic illusions. Typically, a fulthrethu infiltrates a community by securing a safe hiding place, such as a garbage dump or cistern, from which it sends forth an illusory member of that community to spy on and interact with the locals.

Today, fulthrethus who escape their alghollthu creators often gather in small enclaves, but they're no less malevolent. Instead, the fulthrethus' goal of manipulating nearby communities simply becomes more self- serving. Members of a fulthrethu enclave often share the responsibility of maintaining the appearance of an illusory god, through which they reduce nearby villages into unsuspecting cults that supply the fulthrethus with all the food and treasure they desire.

## Fulthrethu Trickery

Although a fulthrethu is skilled at deceiving others through its illusory proxies, it has no magical sensory link to its illusions. To maintain believable control over an illusion or to observe how others react to it, the fulthrethu must remain within range of its illusion (typically 500 feet). Concentrating on a lasting illusion and its flotsam disguise at the same time leaves the fulthrethu limited in the other actions it can take in a round.
