    desc: "`pf2:r` **Trigger** A Medium or larger creature moves through the cell at a faster pace than simply Stepping, or more than one Medium or larger creature enter the cell at the same time\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The ceiling and walls of the cell collapse, creating a thunderous roar. All creatures in the cell must attempt a `DC 25 Reflex check` save; the cell then becomes greater difficult terrain that can be passed through safely.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature takes 1d10+6 bludgeoning damage.\n\n**Failure** The creature takes 2d10+13 bludgeoning damage and is [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] by fallen rubble ([[Actions/Escape|Escape]] DC 25).\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature is buried in the rubble. They take 3d10+19 bludgeoning damage and are [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]] ([[Actions/escape dc=25|escape dc=25]]). Until they escape, the creature must hold their breath or risk suffocating.\n\n[[Other Effects/Effect_ Remaining Air|Effect: Remaining Air]]"
