  - name: "Bond with Mortal"
    desc: " (mental,primal) **Frequency** once per day\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The Keeper forms a bond with a mortal creature. While the bond exists, the Keeper increases their current and maximum Hit Points by 20, gains a +2 status bonus to their attack and damage rolls, and can communicate telepathically with the bonded mortal as long as the two beings are on the same plane. The Keeper can only be bonded with one mortal at a time, and they can take this action again to end the bond or to form a new bond (which also ends the old bond). The bond also ends if the Keeper or the mortal dies.\n\nThis bond strengthens the Keeper's connection to the mortal Universe. While bonded, the Keeper gains the amphibious trait, loses the incorporeal and spirit traits, loses their immunities and resistances, and changes their Strikes to deal the appropriate physical damage (typically bludgeoning) instead of force damage."

  - name: "Bonded Strike"
    desc: "`pf2:2`  **Requirements** The Keeper is currently Bonded with a Mortal\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The Keeper makes a jaws Strike. If this attack hits, the bonded mortal can spend their reaction to Strike the same target."

  - name: "Keeper's Touch"
    desc: " (primal) The Keeper's touch instills their foes with the icy chill of the ocean depths, sapping away their life. A creature hit by the Keeper's tentacle must attempt a `DC 26 Fortitude check` save.\n* * *\n\n**Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Failure** The creature becomes [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]]. If the creature was already drained 1 by the Keeper's touch before attempting the save, a failed save increases the value of the drained condition by 1, to a maximum of [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 4]]. The drained creature is temporarily immune until the start of the Keeper's next turn.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature increases drained value by 2."
