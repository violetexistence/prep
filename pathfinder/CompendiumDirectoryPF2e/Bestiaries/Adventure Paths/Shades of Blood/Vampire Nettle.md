While the aptly named vampire nettle isn't undead, it tends to grow in places frequented by vampires, and this sinister plant's presence is often a key indicator that a graveyard houses more than just the dead. A vampire nettle appears as a coil of thorny vines with narrow, triangular leaves. A single stalk emerges from the plant's central mass, growing to a height of about three feet. The flower that droops from the tip of this stalk is usually white, but for the 24 hours after the nettle feeds, the flower's petals turn blood red.

Due to their affinity with undead, vampire nettles are often found in abandoned burial grounds. Nettles that grow above graves sometimes send roots deep into the ground to suck additional nutrients from the bodies buried below; these vampire nettles often have the elite monster adjustments.

## Vampire Admirers

Many vampires are fond of vampire nettles and are unaffected by the plant's intoxicating scent. Some have been known to drink from the nettle's flower, claiming that the blood takes on a pleasant piquancy akin to notes of a fine wine.
