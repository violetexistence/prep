    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,divine,shadow) Rukh reverts to pure shadow and absorbs her body and her gear into the darkness, or it shifts back to her physical form. In shadow form, Rukh gains a climb Speed equal to her land Speed and can more through any gap that isn't airtight. However, she can only move along solid surfaces that aren't highly reflective, not liquid or mirrored surfaces. If the surface she's on is destroyed, Rukh returns to physical form and is [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]]. She loses fast healing while in shadow form but can remain in shadow form indefinitely.\n\nIf Rukh is exposed to sunlight while in shadow form, she becomes [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 2]] and must attempt a `DC 16 Flat check` at the end of each of her turns. If she fails, she is destroyed, the shadow vanishing with a blood-curdling wail."

  - name: "[[Creature Family Ability Glossary/(Vampire, Strigoi) Strigoi Weaknesses|Strigoi Weaknesses]]"
    desc: "  All strigoi possess the following weaknesses:\n\n*   **Revulsion** Strigoi are uncomfortable near mirrors or sources of bright light. Only a strigoi's shadow reflects in a mirror, and this often compels them to cover or destroy mirrors in their presence rather than risk their true nature being displayed. A strigoi can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of a brandished mirror or source of bright light. To brandish a mirror or light source, a creature must Interact to do so for 1 round (similar to Raising a Shield). If the strigoi involuntarily comes within 10 feet of a brandished mirror or light source, it gains the [[Conditions/Fleeing|Fleeing]] condition, running from the brandished object until it ends an action beyond 10 feet. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of its revulsion, a strigoi can attempt a `DC 25 Will check` save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, it overcomes its revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success). A strigoi can move normally around mirrors or bright light sources that are not brandished, although doing so causes them discomfort that can be noticed with a successful Perception check to [[Actions/Sense Motive|Sense Motive]].\n*   **Sunlight** When exposed to direct sunlight, a strigoi immediately becomes [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]] and falls to the ground. It appears to be dead: it doesn't breathe, its body temperature matches its surroundings, and it doesn't react to pain or other stimuli. A successful `Perception check` check against the strigoi's Reflex DC is enough to note one anomaly: the shadow cast by its \"dead\" body shifts and moves slightly, its edges twisting and active. Spells like [[Spells/Detect Alignment|Detect Alignment]], senses like lifesense, and the \"corpse\" taking damage from vitality energy still function normally, and could reveal the truth without needing a successful Perception check. Viewing the \"corpse\" in a mirror's reflection can also reveal the truth, for only the body's shadow reflects. While in sunlight and unconscious, the strigoi loses its resistance to physical damage. If the strigoi takes enough damage that it would be reduced to 0 Hit Points, its body quickly decomposes, and the strigoi is destroyed.\n*   **Water Revulsion** A strigoi cannot cross a significant source of running water (such as a creek, river, or waves on a seashore). A strigoi capable of flight can cross running water provided it approaches no closer than 10 feet to the liquid's surface. If forced into running water against its will, the strigoi becomes [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 2]] and gains the fleeing condition as long as it remains in the water. At the end of any turn in which the strigoi remains in running water, it must succeed at a `DC 5 Flat check` or be destroyed."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Void Healing|Void Healing]]"
    desc: "  A creature with void healing draws health from void energy rather than vitality energy. It is damaged by vitality damage and is not healed by vitality healing effects. It does not take void damage, and it is healed by void effects that heal undead."

  - name: "Bleed Out"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (attack) **Requirements** Rukh's last action was to cast a non-cantrip spell that granted him a blood magic effect\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Rukh makes a ranged spell attack roll against the AC of a target within 60 feet.

  - name: "Blood Magic—Eerie Veil"
    desc: "  When Rukh casts a bloodline spell using a Focus Point or a sorcerous gift spell using a spell slot, either one target takes a –1 status penalty to Will saving throws for 1 round, or Rukh gains a +2 status bonus to Will saving throws for 1 round.\n\n[[Feat_Feature Effects/Effect_ Aberrant Blood Magic|Effect: Aberrant Blood Magic]]\n\n**Sorcerous gift spells**\n\n*   [[Spells/Slither|Slither]]\n*   [[Spells/Confusion|Confusion]]\n*   [[Spells/Vampiric Feast|Vampiric Feast]]\n*   [[Spells/Stupefy|Stupefy]]\n*   [[Spells/Phantom Pain|Phantom Pain]]"

This requires an `Athletics check` check against the creature's Fortitude DC if the creature is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The creature becomes [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]] and [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]], and Rukh regains 13 healing HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Essence from a creature that's already drained or stupefied doesn't restore any HP, but increases either the creature's drained condition value or its stupefied condition value by 1 (whichever value is lesser is increased; if both values are equal, then the strigoi chooses which condition to increase the value of).\n\nA victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a successful `DC 20 Medicine check` check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drained value by 1 after 10 minutes.\n\nA victim's stupefied condition decreases by 1 per day after performing daily preparations. If the daily preparations are done in full sunlight, the stupefied condition is removed entirely."

  - name: "Reach Spell"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,spellshape) If the next action Rukh takes is to Cast a Spell that has a range, increase that spell's range by 30 feet."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Grab|Grab]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** The monster's last action was a successful Strike that lists Grab in its damage entry, or the monster has a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]\n* * *\n\n**Effect** If used after a Strike, the monster attempts to [[Actions/grapple|grapple]] the creature using the body part it attacked with. This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."
