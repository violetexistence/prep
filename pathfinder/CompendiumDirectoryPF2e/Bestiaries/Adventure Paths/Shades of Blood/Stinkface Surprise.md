    desc: "`pf2:r` **Trigger** A creature opens the trunk or breaks open the trunk; Bypass [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] button\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The trap deals 4d10+22 poison damage to the triggering creature (`DC 26 Fortitude check` save). On a failure, the target is additionally [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] and [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 4]]. A creature can spend one Interact action to scrub the filth from their eyes, removing the blinded condition. A creature can't reduce the value of their sickened condition below 1 until they fully wash the filth off, a process which requires 5 minutes and suitable supplies."
