Defiling the natural order and spitting in the face of convention, the necromancer remains dutifully committed to understanding what forces await beyond the mortal boundaries of life and death.

Hidden secrets and occult powers have an irresistible lure for many. Since the majority of these NPCs are spellcasters, consider using alternative spell lists to adjust their themes.
