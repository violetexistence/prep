If the creature takes damage from the spikes, they also become Grabbed by the gate. The creature can attempt to [[Actions/escape dc=17|escape dc=17]]. If the creature succeeded at their basic Reflex save, they gain a +1 circumstance bonus to their checks to Escape, as the spikes didn't fully impale them. If the creature critically failed their basic Reflex save, they take a â€“2 circumstance penalty to their checks to Escape, as the spikes are embedded particularly deep."
