A tormonshild begins life as a tadpole-like creature hardly largely than a human finger. In this state, the tormonshild is virtually defenseless, but the magic that flows through its body allows it to grow quickly. After a few days, it swells into its more familiar adolescent form. A fully grown tormonshild resembles a two-foot-long frog with six legs, a mouth too large for its body, and flesh the color of a storm cloud. Once grown, the tormonshild decimates the local wildlife, sometimes attacking creatures up to twice its size. Being true omnivores, tormonshilds also feed on plants, preferring juicier crops like tomatoes and fruit. Many a villager has known the anguish of losing their livestock, gardens, and even a beloved pet to a tormonshild infestation.

Concentrations of intense magical energy often result in unusual weather phenomena, typically violent storms or other natural disasters, but sometimes they also create new entirely life-forms. Tormonshilds are born during artificially created storms, when magical energy combines with rainfall to transform the droplets themselves into living creatures. Tormonshilds rarely survive long after their creation; most meet grisly ends at the hands of local predators or dissolve as the magic that fuels their physical bodies fades. A tormonshild that survives its initial weeks of life eventually grows into a pest that menaces the local environment.

## Magical Rainstorms

The rainstorms that produce tormonshilds occur more regularly than most people realize. However, as the majority of tormonshild tadpoles fail to reach maturity, the existence of tormonshilds remains virtually unknown outside of specific areas. While the Mana Wastes regularly experiences magical storms, the region is particularly inhospitable for these creatures. Such storms frequently happen throughout the islands of Azlant, however, and the magical energies that seep from the ancient ruins create conditions ideal for young tormonshilds.
