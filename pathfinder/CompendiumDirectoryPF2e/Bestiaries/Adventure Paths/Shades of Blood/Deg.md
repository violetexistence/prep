    desc: "  Deg fights using a complex device he crafted from scavenged clockwork parts and ancient Azlanti magitech. This device, called an _energy expulsor innovation_, is a clockwork gun bulging with multiple glass canisters, each filled with a different, roiling magical energy. The device allows Deg to use his Concentrated Fire and Overclocked Blast abilities. It otherwise functions as a magical inventor weapon innovation with no modifications."

  - name: "Overclocked Blast"
    desc: "`pf2:2`  Deg Interacts to set his energy expulsor innovation to the desired modular damage configuration, then overclocks his energy expulsor innovation and fires a massive blast of energy in a 100-foot line. This blast deals 8d8 untyped damage (`DC 28 Reflex check` save) of the type determined by the energy expulsor innovation's current configuration. Deg can't use Overclocked Blast again for 1d4 rounds."
