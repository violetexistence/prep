If a swallowed creature is of the maximum size listed, the monster can't use Swallow Whole again. If the creature is smaller than the maximum, the monster can usually swallow more creatures; the GM determines the maximum. The monster attempts an `Athletics check` check opposed by the grabbed creature's Reflex DC. If it succeeds, it swallows the creature. The monster's mouth or jaws no longer grab a creature it has swallowed, so the monster is free to use them to Strike or Grab once again. The monster can't attack creatures it has swallowed.\n\nA swallowed creature is [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]], is [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]], and has to hold its breath or start suffocating. The swallowed creature takes the listed amount of damage when first swallowed and at the end of each of its turns while it's swallowed. If the victim [[Actions/Escape|Escapes]] this ability's grabbed condition, it exits through the monster's mouth. This frees any other creature grabbed in the monster's mouth or jaws. A swallowed creature can attack the monster that has swallowed it, but only with unarmed attacks or with weapons of light Bulk or less. The swallowing creature is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] against the attack. If the monster takes piercing or slashing damage equaling or exceeding the listed Rupture value from a single attack or spell, the swallowed creature cuts itself free. A creature that gets free by either Escaping or cutting itself free can immediately breathe and exits the swallowing monster's space.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Engulf and Swallow Whole|Effect: Engulf and Swallow Whole]]\n\nIf the monster dies, a swallowed creature can be freed by creatures adjacent to the corpse if they spend a combined total of 3 actions cutting the monster open with a weapon or unarmed attack that deals piercing or slashing damage."

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

Left alone too long, a tormonshild eventually grows to the size of a large dog. At this stage, they're known as tormonwirds and become more formidable. A tormonwird's wide mouth develops a throat sac, which the creature uses to produce a croak that disturbs nearby water sources, including liquids inside other creatures. While off-putting, tormonwirds also possess a strangely nurturing side. They defend tormonshilds and have even been known to carry dozens of the tadpoles within their mouths for safety.

* * *

Concentrations of intense magical energy often result in unusual weather phenomena, typically violent storms or other natural disasters, but sometimes they also create new entirely life-forms. Tormonshilds are born during artificially created storms, when magical energy combines with rainfall to transform the droplets themselves into living creatures. Tormonshilds rarely survive long after their creation; most meet grisly ends at the hands of local predators or dissolve as the magic that fuels their physical bodies fades. A tormonshild that survives its initial weeks of life eventually grows into a pest that menaces the local environment.

## Magical Rainstorms

The rainstorms that produce tormonshilds occur more regularly than most people realize. However, as the majority of tormonshild tadpoles fail to reach maturity, the existence of tormonshilds remains virtually unknown outside of specific areas. While the Mana Wastes regularly experiences magical storms, the region is particularly inhospitable for these creatures. Such storms frequently happen throughout the islands of Azlant, however, and the magical energies that seep from the ancient ruins create conditions ideal for young tormonshilds.

## Greater Tormonwirds

As locals tend to slay the creatures upon their discovery, tormonwirds generally live short lives. Rumors persist, though, of tormonwirds that have survived for several years, with some reportedly growing to the size of a small house. While direct evidence of such tormonwirds is lacking, anecdotal accounts of these enormous specimen suggest that greater tormonwirds can use their water manipulation abilities to drain lakes or create storms that produce even more tormonshilds.
