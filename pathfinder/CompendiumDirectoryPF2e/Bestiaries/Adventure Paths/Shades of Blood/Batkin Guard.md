    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,polymorph,primal) The batkin changes into their humanoid or hybrid shape. Each shape has a specific, persistent appearance. In hybrid shape, the batkin appears as a mix between human and a bat. While in hybrid shape, they gain a jaws unarmed Strike resembling a bat's fangs. In their humanoid shape, they retain the appearance of their original ancestry.\n* * *\n\nThe monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

If this Strike hits, the target is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the start of the batkin's next turn or until the target is no longer within the reach of the batkin's hand, whichever comes first."

Unlike true werecreatures, beastkin aren't affected by silver or the full moon, though they can still adopt a hybrid form.

## Batkin And Werebats

Particularly large werebat colonies often host batkin among their ranks. Cultivating a population of batkin offers the werebats numerous benefits, the most obvious being the illusion of normality. Most werebats are nocturnal, so having batkin roam about during the day helps maintain the impression that the werebat settlement is nothing out of the ordinary. Batkin might also guard the colony during full moons, when the werebat members are away indulging in their lunar frenzies. Finally, batkin seem to have an easier time keeping their thirst for blood in check and thus serve as excellent infiltrators in non-werecreature settlements.
