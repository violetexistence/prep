    desc: "`pf2:1` (auditory,mental) **Frequency** once per round\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Hiss beetles aren't bioluminescent like a typical flash beetle, and thus lack that creature's Luminescent Aura and Light Flash abilities. Instead, a hiss beetle can rasp its wide, stumpy legs together to create an unsettling hissing sound. Any creature other than a hiss beetle within a 20-foot emanation must attempt a `DC 13 Will check` save or become [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]] (or [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] on a critical failure). Creatures are then temporarily immune to Unnerving Hiss for 24 hours."

Variant flash beetle

These 3-foot-long insects boast a pair of glowing organs on the back of the abdomen that give off bright light and that continue to glow for days, even after the creature's death. Flash beetles are commonly herded and harvested by miners and spelunkers, as their glow is considered safer than torches and less expensive than lamps. Denizens of the Darklands often domesticate and train these insects, using them as pets, livestock, or caging them to use as organic sources of light in areas frequented by visitors unaccustomed to the darkness.

Not all beetles are harmless creatures that can be easily crushed underfoot. Oversized and ravenous giant beetles can be found throughout the temperate and tropical regions of the world. They are often benign creatures, though when threatened or roused, giant beetles are quite dangerous. Their powerful mandibles and tough exoskeletons make for a challenging combatant.
