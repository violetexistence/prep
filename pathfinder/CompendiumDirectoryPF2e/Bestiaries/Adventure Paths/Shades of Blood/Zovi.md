  - name: "Battle-Grapple Innovation"
    desc: "  Zovi fights using a complex device she crafted from scavenged clockwork parts and ancient Azlanti magitech. Similar in appearance to a grappling hook attached to an auto-retracting cable, this device is called a battle-grapple innovation. It allows Zovi to use her Magitech Propulsion and Whirling Flurry abilities. Unlike other tethered weapons, each time Zovi uses her battle-grapple innovation, she automatically retrieves it as a free action, allowing her to make multiple attacks in a row. It otherwise functions as an inventor weapon innovation with no modifications."

    desc: "`pf2:1`  With a flourish, Zovi activates the ancient magitech kitbashed onto her battle-grapple innovation. For 1d4 rounds, Zovi deals an additional 2d6 fire damage with her battle-grapple innovation. At the end of this time, the magitech backfires in a burst of fire and smoke, dealing 2d6 fire damage to Zovi and making her [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] and [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] for 1 round."

  - name: "Shrieking Flurry"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (flourish) With a high-pitched cackle of glee, Zovi makes a battle-grapple Strike against up to three enemy creatures within 20 feet. Zovi attempts a check to [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] each target she hits with this Shrieking Flurry."
