    desc: "(1 action) The shadow beacon fires shadows into the sky, discharging excess energy out of the device's lower half. The trap deals 4d6 cold + 4d6 void damage to all non-shadow creatures in a 60-foot emanation from the base of the device (`DC 26 Fortitude check` save). For each successful check to disable the trap, the cold and void damage dealt by the trap on subsequent rounds are both reduced by 1d6 damage (see below). A creature that fails their save is pushed back 10 feet (15 feet on a critical failure).\n\n3d6 cold + 3d6 void\n\n2d6 cold + 2d6 void\n\n1d6 cold + 1d6 void"
