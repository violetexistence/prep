  - name: "Flurry of Blows"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Frequency** once per round\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Vinn makes two unarmed Strikes. If both hit the same creature, combine their damage for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses. Apply Vinn's multiple attack penalty to the Strikes normally. When Vinn targets the same creature with both Strikes, if either Strike hits, the target must succeed at a `DC 24 Fortitude check` save or be [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]] ([[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 3]] on a critical failure). This is an incapacitation effect.\n\nAlternatively, Vinn can replace one or both of his attacks during Flurry of Blows with Grapples, Repositions, Shoves, or Trips."

    desc: "  Vinn doesn't take the normal â€“2 circumstance penalty when making a lethal attack with his unarmed attacks."

  - name: "Wolf Stance"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (stance) Vinn enters the stance of the wolf, crouching low to the ground and with his fingers curled like fangs, allowing him to make wolf jaw Strikes with his hands. If he's flanking while in this stance, his wolf jaw strikes gain the trip trait. Once Vinn enters wolf stance, he remains in the stance until he is knocked out or is no longer in combat."
