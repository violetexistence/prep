This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

The unsettling creeping clot appears like a disgusting mound of half- coagulated blood that seeps a constant red effluvium, which in turn is slurped up by the clot's slithering feelers before the stain can spread more than a few inches from its central mass. When it senses danger, a creeping clot can form a protective shell of hardened ooze that makes it look like an enormous scab.

It's a common misconception that a creeping clot feeds on blood. In fact, this crusty ooze absorbs minerals from flesh and blood alike by burrowing its tendrils into a creature, a process that creates painful—and sometimes fatal—blood clotting within the victim's body.

## Farming Clots

A creeping clot's toxin can be harvested as a useful (if risky) medicinal. A successful `DC 22 Medicine check` or `DC 22 Survival check` check and 10 minutes of work on a creeping clot that's been dead for no more than 1 hour produces 1 dose of creeping clot serum (2 doses on a critical success). A critical failure exposes the harvesting creature to the clot's jelly blood. A dose of creeping slot serum spoils after 24 hours. If a dose of creeping clot serum is used while [[Actions/Administer First Aid|Administering First Aid]] to stop bleeding, the Medicine check gains a +3 item bonus, but on a critical failure, the victim is exposed to jelly blood.
