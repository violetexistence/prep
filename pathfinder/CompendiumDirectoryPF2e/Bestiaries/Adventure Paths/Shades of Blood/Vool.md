After this exposure, light doesn't blind the monster again until after it spends 1 hour in darkness.

  - name: "Vampires are Everywhere!"
    desc: "  Vool is convinced there are vampires everywhere and is constantly [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]]. His frightened condition can be removed via magic like clear mind, if someone eases his fears by Lying to him with a successful `DC 18 Deception check` check, or by giving him something else to fear by Coercing him with a `DC 18 Intimidation check` check. Once his frightened condition is removed, Vool becomes particularly brave for 10 minutes and gains a +2 status bonus on saving throws against fear effects. After this time (or earlier, if he sees a vampire), he becomes frightened 1 again. Vool loses this trait while in full sunlight, as that triggers his Light Blindness. (It's tough being a morlock in a vampire's world!)"

    desc: "`pf2:2`  The morlock tinkers with an adjacent construct or mechanical hazard. They attempt a `Crafting check` check against the construct's or hazard's Fortitude DC. The morlock can't succeed if the target's level is more than double the morlock's.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target gains 4d6 healing Hit Points and a +1 circumstance bonus to attack rolls for 1 minute.\n\n**Success** The target gains 2d6 healing Hit Points.\n\n**Critical Failure** The morlock injures itself, taking 2d6 damage (typically bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing, but potentially a different type at the GM's discretion).\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Instinctual Tinker (Critical Success)|Effect: Instinctual Tinker (Critical Success)]]\n* * *\n\nVool can also use this to repair a broken wooden stake pick with a `DC 20 Crafting check` check."

  - name: "Leap Attack"
    desc: "`pf2:2`  The morlock Strides up to twice its Speed, during which it attempts a [[Actions/High Jump|High Jump]] or a [[Actions/Long Jump|Long Jump]]. At any point during its movement, the morlock can make a melee Strike against an enemy in its reach.\n\nThe morlock then can't use Leap Attack for 1 round."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Sneak Attack|Sneak Attack]]"
    desc: "  Vool deals 1d6 extra precision damage to [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] creatures."

  - name: "Swarming Stance"
    desc: "  A morlock can share the same space as another morlock, but no more than two morlocks can occupy the same space. When morlocks share the same space, they gain a +1 circumstance bonus to attack rolls.\n\nVool can't use this ability if he's frightened (because the other morlock he could share a space with might be a vampire)."

  - name: "Wooden Stake Pick"
    desc: "  Vool's \"pick\" consists of a femur with a wooden stake lashed to one end. This weapon functions as a light pick that also has the versatile bludgeoning trait. If Vool critically fails a Strike with the janky weapon, it breaks and becomes useless until he repairs it. If he critically hits a vampire with the weapon, the vampire must succeed at a `DC 21 Fortitude check` save or the stake is driven into its heart, reducing the vampire to 0 Hit Points. Despite his best efforts, Vool can't teach anyone to use the otherwise awkward weapon, although anyone can wield it as a normal +1 light pick with a head made of wood."
