    desc: "`pf2:2`  **Frequency** once per hour\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Tokainen's chosen activates the latent magic in their brand, then launches a ball of flames with a range of 60 feet that explodes in a 10-foot burst. Creatures in the area take 6d6 fire damage (`DC 22 Reflex check` save). A creature that fails their save is additionally dealt 1d4 persistent fire damage.\n\nFor 1 minute, the brand's excess magic suffuses their hands, causing their fists and any weapons they wield to radiate a nimbus of fire, dealing an additional 1d10 fire damage on a Strike. While their hands radiate fire in this way, their fists lose the nonlethal trait."

They can make these attacks in any order, but both attacks must have the same target. Their multiple attack penalty doesn't increase until after both attacks are completed."
