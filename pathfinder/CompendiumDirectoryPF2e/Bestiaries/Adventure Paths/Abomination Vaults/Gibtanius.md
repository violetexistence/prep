When a gibtas feeds regularly but never receives sufficient food to procreate, it grows into a mighty gibtanius. They become surly, uncontrolled predators, forsaking their bonded masters to satiate their unending hunger.

* * *

This rubbery, spheroid scavenger is nearly all acid-dripping mouth, with five bulbous black eyes and two powerful, gangly legs. A gibtas often forms a bond with a single other creature-usually, a more powerful aberration- and serves this master loyally, if erratically. Creatures who keep a gibtas as a pet or guard soon learn to keep it away from any important possessions they don't want spattered with acid.
