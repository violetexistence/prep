    desc: "`pf2:r` (emotion, fear, mental) **Trigger** A living creature remains in area **C4** for at least 1 round\n* * *\n\n**Effect** An overwhelming wave of paranoia fills area **C4**. Each creature in the room must attempt a `DC 25 Will check` save, with the following results. An eerie red eye then opens in the center of the western wall, looking about the room, and the haunt rolls initiative.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]] and feels like someone or something is watching them for as long as they remain frightened.\n\n**Failure** The creature becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] and treats no one as an ally as long as they remain frightened.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 3]] and is [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]] as long as they remain frightened."

    desc: "(1 action) The eye glances about, and those it can see (whether in area **C4** or outside of it) take 4d6 mental damage (`DC 21 Will check` save) as fears of being watched impart ripples of pain.\n\nA creature that takes mental damage from this effect doesn't reduce their [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened]] value at the end of their next turn."

    desc: "The haunt becomes inert at the end of any round in which there are no [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened]] creatures it can see. It stays dormant for 1 hour, after which point it resets."
