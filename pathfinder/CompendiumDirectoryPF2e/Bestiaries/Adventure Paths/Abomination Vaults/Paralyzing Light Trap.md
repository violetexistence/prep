    desc: "`pf2:r` (incapacitation, mental, occult) **Trigger** A non-devil creature moves into the light\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The light expands to fill the room, and each nondevil creature within the room must attempt a `DC 26 Will check` save. A high-pitched chime sounds in the barracks (area **D15**), audible in this room as well. The trap then rolls initiative.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The target is [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 2]].\n\n**Failure** The target is [[Conditions/Paralyzed|Paralyzed]] for 1 round.\n\n**Critical Failure** The target is [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] for 1d4 rounds and paralyzed for 1 round."

    desc: "(1 action) All [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned]] and [[Conditions/Paralyzed|Paralyzed]] creatures in the room take 1d10 mental damage (`DC 26 Will check` save). Creatures who fail also become paralyzed for 1 round but can use a reaction to mentally fight off this stasis; creatures who do so take 5d10 mental damage mental damage but are no longer paralyzed."

    desc: "The stasis magic in the light builds up over the course of an hour, after which the trap can trigger again."
