The most common seugathis spawned by neothelids are seugathi servants. Their masters equip them with tools useful in their tasks (often a wand and a weapon), and they rarely value other material things beyond their usefulness in completing their imprinted mission.

* * *

The wicked, alien [[Bestiary 2/Neothelid|Neothelids]] impregnate themselves through ritualistic magic to produce wormlike servitor creatures called seugathis. These creatures spawn with a strong psychic drive to complete some task on behalf of the neothelids' far-reaching plans. These directives are diverse, strange, and usually cruel toward humanoid life.
