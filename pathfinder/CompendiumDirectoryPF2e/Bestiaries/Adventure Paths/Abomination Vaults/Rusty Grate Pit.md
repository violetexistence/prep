That creature can use the [[Actions/Grab an Edge|Grab an Edge]] reaction to avoid falling.\n\nWhether or not the creature Grabs an Edge, the rusty winch above crashes down atop the triggering creature, dealing 3d10 bludgeoning damage and dislodging its grip (`DC 24 Reflex check` save). The creature can still try to Grab an Edge again."
