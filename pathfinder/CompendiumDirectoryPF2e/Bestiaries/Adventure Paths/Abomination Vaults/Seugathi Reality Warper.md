    desc: "`pf2:3` (concentrate,occult) The seugathi bends reality in their choice of a 10-foot emanation or a 60-foot line, altering the terrain of the area. The terrain becomes a different type of terrain (such as aquatic, arctic, or desert) and becomes normal or difficult terrain, as the seugathi chooses. Structures, general geographic features, and creatures in the area aren't transformed, but creatures in the area take 5d6 spirit damage (`DC 28 Fortitude check` save) as reality tries to bend them along with the terrain.\n\nThough changes to the area are permanent, the natural environment might eventually revert the land back to its original state (aquatic areas drain, arctic areas thaw, and so on)."

Seugathi reality warpers create and destroy inhospitable environments on a small scale by manipulating the forces of raw chaos. A neothelid might spawn such a seugathi to create habitats for unique slaves or guests, or to destroy the ecosystem of a troublesome species. Darklands scholars refer to reality warpers as veterans in the seugathi ranks, but they're more accurately compared to aggressive landscape architects.

* * *

The wicked, alien [[Bestiary 2/Neothelid|Neothelids]] impregnate themselves through ritualistic magic to produce wormlike servitor creatures called seugathis. These creatures spawn with a strong psychic drive to complete some task on behalf of the neothelids' far-reaching plans. These directives are diverse, strange, and usually cruel toward humanoid life.
