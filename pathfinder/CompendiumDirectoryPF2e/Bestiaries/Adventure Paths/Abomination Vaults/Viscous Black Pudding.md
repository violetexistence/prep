  - name: "Adjust Shape"
    desc: "`pf2:r`  A viscous black pudding is thicker than most black puddings and can heap its body upon itself or spread itself out again. The pudding changes its size to Medium, Large, or Huge. If the pudding is Medium, its density reduces its Speeds to 10 feet, but this ability doesn't otherwise change its Strikes or its Speed. If the viscous black pudding Splits, both of the new puddings have the same size as it had at that time, until they Adjust their Shape."

  - name: "Corrosive Mass"
    desc: "  A creature that hits the pudding with a metal or wooden weapon must succeed at a `DC 22 Reflex check` save or the weapon takes 2d6 acid damage (after dealing damage to the black pudding as normal). Thrown weapons and ammunition take this damage automatically with no save."

  - name: "Split"
    desc: "  When the black pudding is hit by an attack that would deal slashing or piercing damage and has 10 or more HP, it splits into two identical puddings, each with half the original's HP.\n\nOne pudding is in the same space as the original, and the other appears in an adjacent unoccupied space. If no adjacent space is unoccupied, it automatically pushes creatures and objects out of the way to fill a space (the GM decides if an object or creature is too big or sturdy to push)."

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

Variant black pudding

Most often found below ground, these oozes scour caves for objects to dissolve with their corrosive secretions. This caustic acid is particularly dangerous to creatures that attack a pudding, as it can quickly damage and destroy gear.

* * *

Slimes, molds, and other oozes can be found in dank dungeons and shadowed forests. While not necessarily evil, some grow to enormous sizes and have insatiable appetites.
