This shadow spawn doesn't have Steal Shadow. If the creature the shadow spawn was pulled from dies, the shadow spawn becomes a full-fledged, autonomous shadow. If the creature recovers from its [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeeblement]], its shadow returns to it and the shadow spawn is extinguished."

    desc: "`pf2:1` (divine) **Requirement** The shadow hit a living creature with a shadow hand Strike on its previous action.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The shadow pulls at the target's shadow, making the creature [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 2]] (or [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 3]] on a critical hit). This is cumulative with other enfeebled conditions from shadows, to a maximum of enfeebled 4. If this increases a creature's enfeebled value to 3 or more, the target's shadow is separated from its body. Enfeebled from Steal Shadow decreases by 1 every hour."

Female greater shadow

Shadows that spend long amounts of time on the Shadow Plane and absorb its magic become greater shadows.

The mysterious undead known as shadows lurk in dark places and feed on those who stray too far from the light. Those who parley with shadows, typically by keeping them at bay with a glowing weapon, may learn great secrets, for they are ideal spies.
