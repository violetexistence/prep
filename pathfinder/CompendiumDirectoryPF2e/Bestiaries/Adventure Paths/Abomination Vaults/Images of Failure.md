    desc: "`pf2:0` (curse, emotion, mental) **Trigger** A creature ends a move action within the trap's area\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The triggering creature takes 2d10+10 mental damage (`DC 32 Will check` save) as it recalls its past failures. A creature that takes damage hears a soft whisper offering, \"Let me take something from you and I can stop the pain.\" A creature who agrees loses access to a random skill feat that isn't a prerequisite for another feat, and the creature doesn't take further damage from Echoes of Defeat. This effect lasts for 1 week and can be ended by effects that remove curses."
