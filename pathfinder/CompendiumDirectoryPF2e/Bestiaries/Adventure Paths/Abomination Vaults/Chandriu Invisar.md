If defeated while she is slowed, she is put to rest.\n* * *\n\nWhen a ghost is destroyed, it re-forms after 2d4 days within the location it's bound to, fully healed. A ghost can be permanently destroyed only if someone determines the reason for its existence and sets right whatever prevents the spirit from resting."

On a success, a creature is temporarily immune to Chandriu's Despairing Cry for 1 minute."
