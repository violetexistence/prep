Those who encounter calignis quickly learn that their deaths involve burning out instead of bleeding out. At times, this dramatic immolation is denied to a caligni, so they arise as a bright walker. Tied to caligni society, these creatures don't understand that their glow damages and repels living calignis. Despite their name, these undead don't walk; they instead float a few inches above the ground.
