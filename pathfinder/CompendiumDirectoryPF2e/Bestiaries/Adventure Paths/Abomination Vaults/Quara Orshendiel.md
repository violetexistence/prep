Female drow leader

Quara will likely become an ally of the heroes, as she knows useful partners when she sees them. She's interested in avenging her father and sister, but she knows that whatever goal her father was pursuing with the Ochre Fulcrum Lens could prove critical in freeing Yldaris from Belcorra's control forever. She has learned that the ochre lens was only one of three lenses that Belcorra entrusted to allies in the region centuries ago, and she sets the heroes on the trail of recovering them and finding out more. The most important lead Quara provides to the heroes is that her father was headed toward an ancient vault at the edge of the lake, so the heroes can find out more at that location.

The heroes might see drow as enemies and assault Yldaris. In this case, Quara does her best to protect her people, relying on the shootist training that still lingers in her quick fingers. She likely won't trust the heroes with any information after such aggressions, but they might find some clues in her quarters.
