A full-grown gibtas uses its powerful legs and rubbery body to bound great distances. Most gibtases remain solitary, unless bonded with a creature.

* * *

This rubbery, spheroid scavenger is nearly all acid-dripping mouth, with five bulbous black eyes and two powerful, gangly legs. A gibtas often forms a bond with a single other creature-usually, a more powerful aberration- and serves this master loyally, if erratically. Creatures who keep a gibtas as a pet or guard soon learn to keep it away from any important possessions they don't want spattered with acid.
