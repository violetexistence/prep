Sinister fleshwarpers reshape captive urdefhans into these juggernauts of war. Their clear skin is hardened into a thick, mirror-like carapace, creating an intimidating exoskeleton. Mulventoks don't live long; within weeks-or, at most, months-their hyperdeveloped muscles split open their toughened skin, and they erupt in a shower of gore. A mulventok's creator shapes its mind just as much as its body, directing its aggression toward a single purpose, such as to raze a fortress or murder a specific individual.

Although twisting victims into horrid shapes is a well-known pastime of evil drow, other subterranean monsters have stolen these practices or developed them independently. The worm-like seugathis sometimes warp other creatures whose territories abut their lightless lands; the fleshwarps below result from morlocks and urdefhans, respectively.
