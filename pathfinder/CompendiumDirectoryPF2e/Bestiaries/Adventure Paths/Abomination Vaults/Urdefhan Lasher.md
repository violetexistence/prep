    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** The urdefhan damaged a creature with a jaws Strike on its last action\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The urdefhan maintains contact, turning the creature's flesh translucent around the site of the injury. The urdefhan chooses one of two options, each of which requires a fortitude save. If the jaws Strike was a critical hit, the creature suffers both effects, using the same save result for both.\n\n*   **Drain Blood** `DC 25 Fortitude check` The urdefhan drinks some of the creature's blood. On a failed save, the creature is [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]] and the urdefhan regains 10 healing HP (or, on a critical failure, it's [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 2]] and the urdefhan regains 20 healing HP).\n*   **Drain Vitality** (necromancy) `DC 25 Fortitude check` The urdefhan draws out some of the creature's vital essence. The creature becomes [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]] for 1 hour on a failed save (or [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 2]] for 1 hour on a critical failure)."

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

Trained from a young age with the strange and powerful shauth lashes, urdefhan lashers would rather die than retreat from combat.

Translucent-skinned scourges of the Darklands, urdefhans are remorseless killers and foot soldiers of the world's end.
