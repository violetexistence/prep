    desc: "  Tremorsense allows a monster to feel the vibrations through a solid surface caused by movement. It is an imprecise sense with a limited range (listed in the ability). Tremorsense functions only if the monster is on the same surface as the subject, and only if the subject is moving along (or burrowing through) the surface."

  - name: "Necrotic Decay"
    desc: " (divine,void) When the shanrigol behemoth dies, its flesh rots away and sublimates into a foul-smelling gas that fills a 5-foot emanation around the body. This gas deals 9d6 void damage to creatures in this area as their flesh curdles and rots as well (`DC 27 Fortitude check` save)."

    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** The shanrigol has a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]]\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The shanrigol squeezes the life essence from its target, dealing 1d10+11 bludgeoning and 1d6 persistent bleed damage (`DC 25 Fortitude check` save).\n\nThe shanrigol regains temporary Hit Points equal to half the amount of bludgeoning damage a single target takes; these temporary Hit Points last for 1 minute."

  - name: "Shred Flesh"
    desc: "  A shanrigol behemoth's attacks brutally rend its foes. Creatures critically hit by the shanrigol's fleshy slap Strike take an additional 2d6 bleed and are [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]] for as long as they are bleeding."

  - name: "Undulating Step"
    desc: "`pf2:2`  The shanrigol separates its flesh from its bones to fit through small spaces. It Strides, ignoring difficult terrain and fitting through tight spaces as though it were a Tiny creature.\n\nIt can't use any actions other than Undulating Step until it occupies an area large enough for its normal form."

  - name: "Web Trap"
    desc: "  A creature hit by the shanrigol behemoth's web attack is [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] and stuck to the nearest surface until it can Escape (DC 25)."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Grab|Grab]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** The monster's last action was a successful Strike that lists Grab in its damage entry, or the monster has a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]\n* * *\n\n**Effect** If used after a Strike, the monster attempts to [[Actions/grapple|grapple]] the creature using the body part it attacked with. This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

Shanrigols that grow with the additions of many living victims can become truly enormous in size and pose a greater danger in their expanding hunting territories. Subterranean communities have collapsed entire tunnels to prevent the creatures from reaching their settlements.

Many shanrigol behemoths absorb enough brain matter to form crude intelligences and take a serpentine or humanoid shape. They're more varied in their abilities than shanrigol heaps, as they often gain abilities from their constituent creatures. The shanrigol behemoth presented below contains flesh from driders and urdefhans, giving it a web attack and necrotic decay ability. Not all shanrigol behemoths have these two abilities, but should have other abilities to replace them.

Fleshwarpers, regardless of their origin or training, create a shocking amount of waste. When the discarded remnants of aberrant flesh are heaped together with an accidental mixture of alchemical compounds or odious energy, the mass can quicken and regain life. Without the guidance of a fleshwarper, these aberrant body parts form into a shanrigol, a mess of bone, muscle, and sinew.
