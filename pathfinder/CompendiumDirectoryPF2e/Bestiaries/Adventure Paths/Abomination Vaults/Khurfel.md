Khurfel chooses one of two options, each of which requires a `DC 28 Fortitude check` save. If the jaws Strike was a critical hit, the creature suffers both effects, using the same save result for both.\n\n*   Drain Blood Khurfel drinks some of the creature's blood. On a failed save, the creature is [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]] and Khurfel regains 10 healing HP (or, on a critical failure, it's [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 2]] and Khurfel regains 20 healing HP).\n*   Drain Vitality Khurfel draws out some of the creature's vital essence. The creature becomes [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]] for 1 hour on a failed save (or [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 2]] for 1 hour on a critical failure)."

Male urdefhan war champion

Khurfel leads the largest and most active group of adversaries the heroes face in the Abomination Vaults. His fated confrontation with the heroes is necessary because he holds the Emerald Fulcrum Lens and refuses to give it up as long as he lives, as it symbolizes the leadership of his cult. Khurfel's vision of falling at the heroes' hands doesn't inspire fear-it inspires fury, and he fights against his prophesized enemies as long as breath remains in his body.
