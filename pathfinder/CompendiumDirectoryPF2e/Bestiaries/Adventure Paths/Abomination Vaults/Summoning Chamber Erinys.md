Erinyes exact vengeance and bloody justice for a creature's crimes, torturing and punishing their victims in ironic fashion before allowing them the escape of death. While an erinys appears as a fallen angel and the first erinyes shared that origin, erinyes now originate in myriad ways, some promoted from lesser devils and others shaped from lemures themselves forged from the souls of torturers and persecutors. The erinyes' origin is entwined with Eiseth, herself a fallen angel and one of Hell's most powerful demigods. The first erinyes were all considered to be Eiseth's metaphorical daughters, but erinyes formed since that time are no longer limited to a single gender.

Masters of corruption and architects of conquest, devils seek both to tempt mortal life to join in their pursuit of all things profane and to spread tyranny throughout all worlds. The temptations they offer mortals range from great powers granted by the signing of an infernal contract to twisted favors following a whispered pledge to a diabolic patron, or any number of even subtler exchanges. Those who succumb to these temptations find themselves consigned to an afterlife of endless torment in the pits of Hell, wherein the only hope of escape lies in the chance of being promoted to become a devil in the infernal ranks. Every devil has a specific role to play in the upkeep of the remorseless bureaucratic machine that is Hell, from soldiers and scholars to inquisitors, lawyers, judges, and executioners. Lowly lemures and imps perform subservient labor to more powerful and specialized devils, such as contract devils and erinyes, while the greatest pit fiends command entire infernal armies.
