Although Wrin usually performs this reading for an individual person or to answer a pressing question she has, for the purposes of this campaign she reads the stars for the party as a whole. She attempts an `Astrology Lore check` check, using the DC appropriate for the heroes' current level.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The results of Wrin's astrological readings have the effects of [[Spells/Read Omens|Read Omens]], and the heroes gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws for 24 hours.\n\n**Success** The results of Wrin's astrological readings have the effects of [[Spells/Augury|Augury]], but can predict results up to 24 hours into the future.\n\n**Failure** No reading.\n\n**Critical Failure** Wrin brushes against hostile spiritual forces, and cannot Read the Stars for 1 week.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Read the Stars (Critical Success)|Effect: Read the Stars (Critical Success)]]"
