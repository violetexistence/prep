    desc: "(1 action) The gas intensifies. Each creature in the room must make a `DC 30 Fortitude check`.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected and becomes temporarily immune to the gas for 1 hour, though if the creature has already been stupefied by the trap, that condition remains for its normal duration.\n\n**Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Failure** The creature becomes [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] for 24 hours. If the target is already stupefied, the condition value increases by 1 (to a maximum of stupefied 4) and the target takes 8d6 mental damage.\n\n**Critical Effect** As failure, except the target takes double the mental damage."

    desc: "After an hour, the trap deactivates; the gas disperses slowly, and the doors can be opened again. After 24 hours, the gas builds up and the trap can be triggered again."
