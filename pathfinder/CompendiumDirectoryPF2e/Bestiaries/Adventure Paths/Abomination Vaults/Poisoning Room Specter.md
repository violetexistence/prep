The creature is [[Conditions/Controlled|Controlled]] by the specter, obeying the specter's telepathic or spoken orders, though a spectral thrall does not obey obviously self-destructive orders. This lasts until the end of the thrall's next turn, at which point it is no longer controlled but becomes [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] for 1 hour.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the duration is unlimited. The thrall can attempt a new Will save at the end of each of its turns; on a success, it is no longer controlled by the specter but becomes [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] for 1 hour."

When an evil mortal creature dies, it sometimes returns to haunt the area of its death as a specter, a hateful remnant, always seeking to slay others-particularly humanoids-in an attempt to distribute its pain among as many souls as it can. A specter maintains a strange semblance of its prior identity, but with a corrupted sense of purpose. It cannot be reasoned with.

A specter denied the opportunity to harm living humanoids grows increasingly agonized and irrational, akin to the mindset of a starving person forever denied a release from agony through death.
