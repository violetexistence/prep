A voidglutton is a powerful type of will-o'-wisp that haunts a site where misery dwells-such as a graveyard, prison camp, or recent battlefield. A voidglutton appears as a seething sphere of glowing eyes swirling around an empty black vortex 4 feet wide. From within this vortex extend long, semi-transparent tendrils that end in seven-fingered, needled hands.
