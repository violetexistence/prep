    desc: "`pf2:2` (incapacitation) Vischari makes a fist Strike that shuts down her target's motor control. The target must make a `DC 25 Fortitude check` save. If the Strike was a critical hit, treat the target's save result as one degree worse. The target is then temporarily immune for 1 hour.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The target is [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]].\n\n**Failure** The target is [[Conditions/Paralyzed|Paralyzed]] for 1 round.\n\n**Critical Failure** The target is paralyzed for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, it can attempt a new Fortitude save to reduce the remaining duration by 1 round or end it entirely on a critical success."

  - name: "Wicked Bite"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** Vischari damaged a creature with a jaws Strike on her last action\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Vischari maintains contact, turning the creature's flesh translucent around the site of the injury. Vischari chooses one of two options, each of which requires the target to attempt a `DC 25 Fortitude check` save. If her jaws Strike was a critical hit, the creature suffers both effects, using the same save result for both.\n\n*   **Drain Blood** Vischari drinks some of the creature's blood. On a failed save, the creature is [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]] and Vischari regains 10 healing HP (on a critical failure, it's [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 2]] and Vischari regains 20 healing HP).\n*   **Drain Vitality** Vischari draws out some of the creature's vital essence. The creature becomes [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]] for 1 hour on a failed save (or [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 2]] for 1 hour on a critical failure)."
