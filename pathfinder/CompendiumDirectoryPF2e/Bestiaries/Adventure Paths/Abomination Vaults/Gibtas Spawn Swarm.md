When a gibtas gorges itself on an incredible amount of flesh, it vomits up a pool of acid filled with tiny pink egg sacs that burst immediately. The new babies hunt as a pack, growing in size until they go their separate ways or consume each other.

* * *

This rubbery, spheroid scavenger is nearly all acid-dripping mouth, with five bulbous black eyes and two powerful, gangly legs. A gibtas often forms a bond with a single other creature-usually, a more powerful aberration- and serves this master loyally, if erratically. Creatures who keep a gibtas as a pet or guard soon learn to keep it away from any important possessions they don't want spattered with acid.
