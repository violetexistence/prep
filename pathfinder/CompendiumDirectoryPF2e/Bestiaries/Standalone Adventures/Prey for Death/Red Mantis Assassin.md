If the Feint is successful, the assassin's next successful strike with a sawtooth saber in that same turn deals 2d6 persistent bleed damage to the target. In addition, provided they remain visible to that target and that target remains within 30 feet of the assassin, additional Prayer Attacks against that target automatically cause them to become [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] against the assassin's attacks until the end of their turn."
