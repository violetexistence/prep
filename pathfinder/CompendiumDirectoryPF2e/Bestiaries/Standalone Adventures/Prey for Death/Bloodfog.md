    desc: "  A bloodfog's body is composed of a semisolid red fog similar in consistency to thick foam. This enables a bloodfog to move through spaces as narrow as 1 inch in diameter with no reduction to its Speed. However, a bloodfog can't wear or interact with objects. It also can't enter water or other fluids, and it's treated as Tiny for the purpose of how wind affects it."

In addition to the spell's normal trigger, a bloodfog can cast blood vendetta as a reaction even if the target's piercing, slashing, or persistent bleed damage didn't actually result in damage to the bloodfog itself (either as a result of its resistance blocking the damage or its immunity to bleed coming into effect)."

A bloodfog is an immense creature composed of hungry crimson mist. Vaguely humanoid faces, often little more than gaping skulls, constantly form and dissolve within their vaporous bodies. Much more solid are their ruby-red tendrils that slither out from their mass and cause deep slashing wounds.

Bloodfogs prefer to hunt near populated areas or sites of massive violence, drifting in to feed, then drifting out again. They roll through vibrant villages, leaving behind only silence and desiccated corpses. Bloodfogs are thought to be created in the place where they're most often encountered: the killing fields, where armies cause massive bloodshed and death.

## Blood Of The Empty Death

It's believed that bloodfogs first came into being due to the influence of the sinister goddess known as Nhimbaloth. Voidbracken, the name Nhimbaloth's long-dead homeworld, is said to contain entire islands, even subcontinents, swathed in immense bloodfogs. Some claim that the smaller fogs encountered elsewhere are merely "feelers for feeding," extended through one-way portals on Voidbracken to other planes of existence.
