This construct was built hundreds of years ago by Red Mantis arcanists, then imbued with intelligence as a divine protector by priests of Achaekek not long after the assassin cult fled Rahadoum. Silver Saber's single purpose is to guard the secrets of the Blood Mistress from those who are unworthy.

When at rest, Silver Saber appears as an ornate mirror, but when confronted in battle they animate into the form of a praying mantis made of polished, almost liquid silver with a blank humanoid face.

## Life as a Mirror

Silver Saber has watched the followers of Achaekek for centuries, sitting silently in their gold frame and pretending to be a mirror. They know more about the secret lives of the Red Mantis than has ever been recorded in the Sarzari, but their objective isn't to record history, it's to function as a guardian—no more, no less.
