    desc: "  Ordulf hasn't met a significant combat challenge in ages, and even when facing deadly foes like the PCs his arrogance can be used against him. If a PC successfully [[Actions/Disarm|Disarms]], [[Actions/Feint|Feints]], [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightens]], or [[Actions/Trip|Trips]] Ordulf, his arrogance gets the better of him and he grows sloppy in his tactics, reducing his AC to 34 until the start of his next turn. A PC can also attempt to issue a more debilitating insult to Ordulf.\n\n## Insult Ordulf `pf2:2`\n\nThe PC spends several seconds issuing insults and taunts to Ordulf, then attempts a `DC 38 Deception check`, `DC 38 Intimidation check`, or `DC 38 Performance check` check. If the insults include challenges to Ordulf's bravery, compare him to a troll or a chicken, insult his skill at fishing, or liken him to a witch or national of Irrisen, this becomes a DC 33 check.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** You strike a nerve. Not only does Ordulf become [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]] with anger, he is also [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]] from the shock of your words.\n\n**Success** Your insults cause Ordulf to become sickened 2 with anger.\n\n**Failure** Your insult only has a brief effect, causing Ordulf to become [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]]. He automatically recovers from this sickened condition at the end of his next turn.\n\n**Critical Failure** Your attempt to insult Ordulf fails so spectacularly that he becomes temporarily immune to Insult Ordulf activities from you for 24 hours."

    desc: "`pf2:r`  **Trigger** A creature within the monster's reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The monster attempts a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, the monster disrupts that action. This Strike doesn't count toward the monster's multiple attack penalty, and its multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike."

    desc: "`pf2:2`  Ordulf Strikes two adjacent creatures within his reach. Both attacks count against his multiple attack penalty, but do not increase his penalty until he has made both attacks."

  - name: "Crushing Insult"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (auditory,linguistic,mental) **Frequency** once per round\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Ordulf issues a devastating and humiliating insult to a creature within 30 feet that he can see. Ordulf attempts an `Intimidation check` check against the target's Will DC. That character is then temporarily immune to Crushing Insult for 24 hours.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The insult is distracting and humiliating; the target is [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] and [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] for 1 minute.\n\n**Success** The insult is distracting, but its effects pass quickly; the target is stupefied 1 and off-guard until the start of Ordulf's next turn.\n\n**Failure** The insult barely cuts, but is distracting enough that the target is off-guard until the end of Ordulf's turn.\n\n**Critical Failure** Ordulf's attempted insult fails spectacularly, and the PC who he was attempting to insult can instantly insult him back, using Insult Ordulf as a free action."

  - name: "Deadly Display"

    desc: "`pf2:3`  Ordulf Strikes each enemy within his reach. Each attack counts toward his multiple attack penalty, but do not increase his penalty until he has made all his attacks."
