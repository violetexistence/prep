    desc: "  Mantis Keeper belongs to the animal druidic order, yet they don't have a single animal companion. Instead, they are served by the deadly mantises that dwell upon Mediogalti Isle, and their command over them is bolstered by the Mantis Stones. At any one time, Mantis Keeper is attended by two of these enormous insects, each of which treat Mantis Keeper as a valued ally. Mantis Keeper can communicate with any form of deadly mantis by speaking Wildsong to them, although the mantises cannot reply. These deadly mantises do not have the minion trait, and Mantis Keeper need not Command an Animal to command themâ€”they can simply issue orders via Wildsong as a free action."

  - name: "Mantis Stone Stride"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (electricity,move,primal,teleportation) Mantis Keeper Steps, Strides, or Flies into one of the Mantis Stones, then immediately exits a different Mantis Stone into a square adjacent to the stone and continues the rest of their movement. When Mantis Keeper exits a Mantis Stone, they create a pulse of lightning that inflicts 8d6 electricity damage (`DC 38 Reflex check` save) to all creatures within 10 feet of Mantis Keeper when they emerge from the Mantis stone."

  - name: "Steady Spellcasting"
    desc: "  If a reaction would disrupt Mantis Keeper's spellcasting action, they attempt a `DC 15 Flat check`. If they succeed, the action isn't disrupted."

  - name: "Verdant Scythe"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  Mantis Keeper has cultivated a unique seed to serve as a special verdant weapon. When they activate this ability, the seed transforms into a scythe, or the scythe transforms back into a seed. This scythe appears to be made entirely of wood, with a short upper blade that extends into a lengthy mantis-like arm when they attack. Although made of wood, Mantis Keeper's verdant scythe functions as if its blade were made of iron. If they're slain, the weapon quickly rots away, leaving behind rune-inscribed seeds that function as runestones that are inscribed with the weapon's qualities."
