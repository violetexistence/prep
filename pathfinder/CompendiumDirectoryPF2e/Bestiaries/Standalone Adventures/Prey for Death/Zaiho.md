    desc: "`pf2:r`  **Trigger** Zaiho would roll a saving throw against an effect that would cause Hit Point damage\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Zaiho quickly procures some outlandish gadget or device from his pouches to protect himself from the triggering effect. Rather than roll the normal saving throw against the effect, Zaiho instead attempts a `Crafting check` check in place of that saving throw, treating the result of this check as the result of the saving throw instead. If this results in a critical failure, Zaiho's gadgets are damaged, and he can no longer use this reaction for 24 hours."
