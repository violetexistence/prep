Variant valkyrie

Choosers of the slain and so-called angels of battle, the song of the valkyries plays wherever steel rings against steel. Valkyries are humanoid individuals of impressive physical stature who seek the most epic battles and legendary conflicts so that they can lay claim to the souls of the world's greatest warriors. The valkyries transform these souls into the implacable immortals known as einherjar.

Valkyries most often serve gods of battle and war, though a valkyrie might pledge their service to any deity they consider worthy. Gorum is particularly well known for having valkyrie and einherjar servants, though he isn't the only such deity. Besmara also has valkyrie servitors, and many stories of "ghost ships" actually reference accounts of encounters with ships manned by einherjar crews devoted to the Pirate Queen.
