    desc: "  **Thresholds** 180 (3 segments), 90 (2 segments)\n\nTroops are composed of many individuals, represented by four \"segments\" on a battle grid. Each segment is 10 feet on each side and as tall as the individual members of the troop. Segments must remain contiguous. Each one has to share at least 5 feet of one of its edges with another segmentâ€”being adjacent on a diagonal isn't sufficient! You can measure flanking, cover, and the like using the center of any segment.\n\nA troop has two Hit Point thresholds in its HP entry and loses segments as it crosses thresholds. Typically, the higher threshold is at 2/3 of the troop's maximum Hit Points and the lower is at 1/3 of its maximum. Once the troop drops below the higher threshold, it loses one segment, leaving three segments (12 squares) remaining and setting the first threshold as the troop's new maximum Hit Points. This repeats when the troop drops below the lower threshold, leaving two segments (8 squares). At 0 Hit Points, the troop disperses entirely, with the few remaining members surrendering, [[Conditions/Fleeing|Fleeing]], or easily dispatched, as determined by the GM. Typically the creature who caused the troop to lose a segment decides which to remove, or the GM decides when a specific creature wasn't responsible. To restore lost segments and maximum Hit Points, a troop needs to spend downtime to use long-term treatment on casualties or recruit new members to replace the fallen.\n\nTroops are typically immune to non-damaging effects that target a single creature, such as a [[Spells/Charm|Charm]] spell or the [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] action. An ability that can target 5 or more creatures can target an entire segment, increasing to two segments if it can target 10 or more creatures and to the entire troop if it can target 20 or more creatures. An ability that affects all creatures in a certain range affects all segments in range (make any checks or saves separately for each segment). As examples, an 8th rank _charm_ spell (with 10 targets) can affect two segments, and an ability that Demoralizes all creatures within 30 feet of you would affect all segments that are fully within that range. A non-damaging ability that would prevent a segment from acting, cause them to flee, or otherwise make them unable to function as part of the troop for a round or more removes the segment entirely. The troop loses a number of HP required to bring it to the next threshold. If an ability both deals damage and has a non-damaging effect, apply the damage then the rest of the effect."

    desc: "`pf2:2`  The einherji host launches a ranged attack in the form of a volley of thrown daggers. This volley fills a 30-foot cone; all creatures in the area take 5d4+15 piercing damage (`DC 36 Reflex check` save). When the troop is reduced to 2 or fewer segments, this area decreases to a 15-foot cone."

  - name: "Jotun Slayer"
    desc: "  An einherji host has a +4 circumstance bonus to Strike as One damage rolls made against giants and creatures that are Huge or larger."

  - name: "Pay For Every Inch"
    desc: "`pf2:3`  The einherji host Forms Up, Raises Shields, and prepares to counterattack. Until the start of the troop's next turn, each time an enemy takes an action to move through a space adjacent to the troop, they take 4d8+18 slashing damage (`DC 36 Reflex check` save)."

  - name: "Raise Shields"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  The troop raises their shields, increasing their Armor Class by 2 until the start of the troop's next turn."

  - name: "Song of Freedom"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,mental) The troop sings of freedom, bolstering their conviction and morale. Until the start of the troop's next turn, their Will saves increase to +29 against all mental effects, not just against fear effects."

  - name: "Strike as One"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Frequency** once per round\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The einherji host makes melee attacks against each enemy in a 5-foot emanation (`DC 36 Reflex check` save). The damage depends on the number of actions.\n\n`pf2:1` 2d8+7 slashing damage\n\n`pf2:2` 3d8+14 slashing damage\n\n`pf2:3` 4d8+14 slashing damage"

  - name: "Troop Movement"
    desc: "  Whenever the einherji host Strides, they first Form Up as a free action to condense into a 20-foot-by-20-foot area (minus any missing squares they may have as the result of having taken Hit Point damage), then move up to their Speed. This works just like a Gargantuan creature moving; for instance, if any square of the troop enters difficult terrain, the extra movement cost applies to the whole troop."
