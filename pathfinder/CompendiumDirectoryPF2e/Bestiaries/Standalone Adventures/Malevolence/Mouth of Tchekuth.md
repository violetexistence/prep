    desc: "The chasm below shifts and ripples, transforming into a vast, gaping mouth filled with countless sharp fangs. A puckered, rasping tongue lances up from the noxious gulping depths below to lash and taste. Two words boom up from the vast throat below: \"IÃ¶ Tchekuth!\""

    desc: "`pf2:r` (emotion, fear, mental, occult) **Trigger** a creature crosses the chasm\n* * *\n\n**Effect** A vast, fanged maw appears to open below, and a long rasping tongue lurches up to attack the triggering creature, who must attempt a `DC 24 Will check` save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature realizes the haunt is a frightening phantasm that can't actually hurt them and is unharmed.\n\n**Success** The creature dodges the rasping tongue but falls from the bridge as a result, taking 10 damage from the fall (the creature can Grab an Edge with a successful `DC 24 Reflex check` save).\n\n**Failure** For a brief moment, the creature feels the awful touch of the rasping tongue as it brushes against them, licking away memories and causing the creature to become [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] for 24 hours. The creature then falls (as success above).\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature feels the tongue wrap around them and then experiences the awfulness of being pulled downward for what seems like days, but in fact, only an instant passes. The creature becomes [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] for 24 hours, during which time they can't remember their name. The creature also increases the value of their malevolence condition by 1 and then falls (as success above)."
