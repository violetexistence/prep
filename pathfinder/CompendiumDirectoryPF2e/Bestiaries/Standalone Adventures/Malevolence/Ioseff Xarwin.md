A ghost can be permanently destroyed only if someone determines the reason for its existence and sets right whatever prevents the spirit from resting.\n* * *\n\nIn order to put Ioseff to rest, the following three conditions must be met after defeating Ioseff but before he rejuvenates:\n\n*   The undead brain collector in area D6 has been destroyed.\n*   The brains of his wife and children have been freed from the brain collector statue, allowing their souls to move to the Boneyard.\n*   The Void Mirror has been replaced in its frame in the Cosmic Crypt."

  - name: "Shame"
    desc: "  Ioseff takes a -1 item penalty to attack rolls and saving throws against a character who carries Fulvia's ring. This penalty doubles to -2 against a character who wears Fulvia's ring. At the start of ttheir turn, a character who possesses Fulvia's ring can attempt a secret `DC 20 Perception check` check; on a success, they sense a faint compulsion fueled by outrage to present Fulvia's ring to the ghost."

    desc: "`pf2:r`  **Trigger** A creature within 30 feet of Ioseff fails a saving throw against one of his spells\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Ioseff infuses the magic of his spell with the agonies of his own death. In addition to any effects caused by the triggering spell, the target must also attempt a `DC 28 Fortitude check` save. or contract internal insurrection at stage 1 (stage 2 on a critical failure)\n\n**Internal Insurrection** (disease); **Level 7**.\n\nThe target can't recover from the clumsy condition from internal insurrection until the disease is cured\n\n**Stage 1** [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] (1 day)\n\n**Stage 2** [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 2]] (1 day)\n\n**Stage 3** clumsy 2 and [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] (1 day)\n\n**Stage 4** [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 3]] and off-guard (1 day)\n\n**Stage 5** death, and the target's body splits apart into a mass of fragments that crawls outward in a 10-foot-emanation before perishing, leaving a bare skeleton surrounded by gore."

  - name: "Malevolent Possession"
    desc: "`pf2:2`  Ioseff Xarwin attempts to possess an adjacent corporeal creature. This has the same effect as the [[Spells/Possession|Possession]] spell, except since Ioseff Xarwin doesn't have a physical body, it is unaffected by that restriction of the spell.\n\nThe target must attempt a `DC 28 Will check` save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** You possess the target but can't control it. You ride along in the body while the spell lasts.\n\n**Failure** You possess the target and take partial control of it. You no longer have a separate turn; instead, you might control the target. At the start of each of the target's turns, it attempts another Will save. If it fails, it's [[Conditions/Controlled|Controlled]] by you on that turn; if it succeeds, it chooses its own actions; and if it critically succeeds, it forces you out and the spell ends.\n\n**Critical Failure** You possess the target fully, and it can only watch as you manipulate it like a puppet. The target is Controlled by you.\n\nA character who carries Fulvia's ring on their person gains a +4 item bonus to their save and treats the result of the save as one degree of success better than their rolled result. If Ioseff attempts to use this ability on a character who wears Fulvia's ring, he can attempt a Perception check against the ring-wearer's Stealth DC to notice the ring in time to avoid the attempt; on a success, he loses the two actions he took to make the attempt but avoids further effects. If he doesn't notice the ring and attempts to possess the ring-wearer, the ring-wearer automatically gains a critical success on their Will save, Ioseff is [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 3]], and he can't use Malevolent Possession again for 24 hours."

  - name: "Phantasmal Amputation"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (occult) **Frequency** once per day\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Ioseff holds up the stump of his left arm, and the streaming blood begins to form a ghostly hand that he then uses to point out a humanoid creature within 30 feet. That creature must attempt a `DC 28 Fortitude check` save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] by a sudden, agonizing pain in their left hand.\n\n**Success** As critical success, but the creature also takes 2d6 slashing damage and is [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] for 1 round as they feel as if their left hand just got lopped off by a hatchet.\n\n**Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]], takes 5d6 slashing damage, and is [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 2]] for 1 minute as they feel as if their left hand just got lopped off by a hatchet.\n\n**Critical Failure** The PC is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 3]] and takes 8d6 slashing damage and 2d6 bleed damage as their left hand appears to detach and fall to the floor before instantly decaying into bones. The PC is clumsy 2 and [[Conditions/Wounded|Wounded 1]]. As soon as this wounded condition is removed, the PC's hand miraculously returns and the clumsy condition ends."
