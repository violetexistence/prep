    desc: "`pf2:r` (auditory, emotion, fear, mental, occult) **Trigger** Three or more creatures enter area D2, or anyone attempts to gather or destroy the bird remains\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The carrion vortex fills area D2 with the overwhelming cries of what sounds like thousands of whippoorwills, but this cacophony can't be heard beyond this room. Creatures in area D2 must attempt a `DC 21 Will check` save. (worshipers of Pharasma or those with ties to psychopomps gain a +4 circumstance bonus to this save).The haunt then rolls initiative.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature understands the dirge is also intended as a warning and a desperate request for absolution. The creature can sense the presence of the corrupted psychopomps in areas D5 and E4 as if under the effects of a locate spell, for 24 hours. As long as this effect persists, the character gains a +1 status bonus to attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks made against the corrupted psychopomps in these areas.\n\n**Success** As critical success, but the locate effect only lasts 10 minutes. The creature takes 2d8 mental damage from overwhelming feelings of sadness and despair.\n\n**Failure** The creature takes 4d8 mental damage from overwhelming feelings of sadness and despair.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature takes 6d8 mental damage from overwhelming feelings of sadness and despair, and as long as the haunt remains active and they remain in area D2, the character is [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] as they're forced to do nothing but sob for one action every round."
