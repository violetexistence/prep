Each living or undead creature within a 60-foot emanation must attempt a `DC 18 Will check` save. The effect lasts for 1 round, but a nosoi can use this ability again on subsequent rounds to extend the duration by 1 round for all affected creatures. A creature that succeeds at any save is temporarily immune for 24 hours. Despite being a mental effect, this ability affects mindless undead. Psychopomps are immune to this ability.\n* * *\n\n**Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Fascinated|Fascinated]].\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, and the creature must spend each of its actions on its turn to move closer to the nosoi as expediently as possible while avoiding obvious dangers. If a [[Conditions/Fascinated|Fascinated]] creature is adjacent to the nosoi, it stays still and doesn't act. If the creature is attacked, the fascination ends."
