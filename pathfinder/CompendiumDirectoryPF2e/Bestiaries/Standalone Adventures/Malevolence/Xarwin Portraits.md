    desc: "`pf2:r` (occult) **Trigger** At least four characters are in area B22, or someone touches or attempts to damage a painting\n* * *\n\n**Effect** All characters in area B22 must attempt a `DC 27 Will check` save to resist sudden, agonizing pain (the PC with the highest Intelligence feels this pain in the left wrist, while the others feel it in their heads). On a failure, a PC becomes [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] from the agony ([[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]] on a critical failure). The haunt then rolls initiative."

  - name: "Routine"
    desc: "(4 actions) The haunt uses up to 4 actions to afflict bleeding wounds on different creatures in area B22. These bloody wounds manifest where the target would have felt pain from Inflict Agony, regardless of whether they succeeded in resisting that effect or not. A creature can't be targeted more than once by this routine. Each creature affected must attempt a `DC 24 Fortitude check` save.\n\nThe haunt loses 1 action for each painting that's disabled or destroyed.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature takes 1d8+3 slashing damage and is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]] by the conviction that these wounds were caused by a loved one.\n\n**Failure** As success, but 2d8+6 slashing damage, 1d6 bleed, and [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]].\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but 4d8+12 slashing damage, 2d6 bleed, and [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 3]]. Increase the value of the character's malevolence condition by 1."
