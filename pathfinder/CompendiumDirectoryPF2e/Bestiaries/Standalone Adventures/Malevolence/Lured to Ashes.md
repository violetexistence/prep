    desc: "The illusory scene of a furnished study covers the room's actual appearance. It flickers and fades, revealing a scorched and burnt chamber. A moment later, the screams of burning victims fill the room, and blazing skeletal arms reach from the ashes and charred walls to scrape and claw."

    desc: "`pf2:r` (auditory, linguistic, mental, occult) **Trigger** A creature moves more than 5 feet into the room\n* * *\n\n**Effect** All creatures in area B18 and all creatures within 10 feet of an open door or window adjacent to area B18 hear a compelling voice inviting them into the room to discuss a future move back to central Cheliax.\n\nEach creature must attempt a `DC 22 Will check` save (creatures outside of area B18 gain a +2 circumstance bonus to this save). On a failure, the creature is compelled to move into area B18 and be seated on one of the sofas.\n\nCreatures who succeed at the save aren't compelled and see the room as the burnt ruin that it is. The haunt then rolls initiative."

  - name: "Routine"
    desc: "1 Action: If there are no targets within area B18 when the haunt takes its action, it can use its Lure reaction to try to get nearby victims back inside. The haunt manifests several burning skeletal arms that reach up from the ruined floors or out of the burnt walls to claw at every creature in area B18. These creatures must attempt a `DC 22 Reflex check` save (creatures seated on a sofa take a -2 circumstance penalty to this saving throw).\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature takes no damage.\n\n**Success** The creature takes 1d8 fire damage.\n\n**Failure** The creature takes 2d8 fire damage and gains weakness 5 to fire. This weakness persists until the creature is fully healed.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but 4d8 fire damage and weakness 10 to fire."
