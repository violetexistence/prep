Each living creature that enters or starts their turn in the aura must succeed at a `DC 21 Will check` save or the unnerving, bitter sobs render them distraught and they become [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] for as long as they remain within the aura. A creature that succeeds is temporarily immune for 1 hour.\n\nAnitoli Nostreaema can activate or deactivate the aura with a single free action, which has the concentrate trait."

  - name: "Steal Breath"
    desc: " (curse,incapacitation,occult) Anitoli Nostreaema siphons the breath from living creatures, sapping their strength.

  - name: "Steal Voice"
    desc: " (auditory,curse,occult) When Anatoli Nostraema hits a living creature with a bony hand Strike, it tries to pull the victim's voice into its aura. The victim must attempt a `DC 24 Will check` save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The target's voice is weak for 1 minute. Anytime it attempts an action with the auditory trait, it must succeed at a `DC 5 Flat check` check or the action is lost.\n\n**Failure** The target loses the ability to speak for 1 hour, until the curse is removed, or until the attic whisperer is destroyed, whichever comes first. During this time, the attic whisperer can perfectly mimic the target's voice, and the target takes a -2 circumstance penalty to saving throws against that attic whisperer's aura of sobs.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the effects lasts until the attic whisperer is destroyed or the curse is removed."
