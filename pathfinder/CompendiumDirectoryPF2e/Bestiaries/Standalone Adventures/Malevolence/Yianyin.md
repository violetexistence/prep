The overwhelming presence of this alien intelligence causes the creature to become [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] for 1 round as they shake and tremble with fear.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature is instead [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]] and knows the name of what watches from those empty eyes: Tchekuth."

    desc: "`pf2:1` (divine,incapacitation,mental) Yianyin telepathically compels a creature within 30 feet to approach and allow Yianyin to kiss them, in preparation for using Kiss of Death. The target must attempt a `DC 25 Will check` save.\n\n**Success** The creature is unaffected and is temporarily immune to Compel Condemned for 24 hours.\n\n**Failure** The creature must spend each of its actions to move closer to Yianyin as quickly as possible, while avoiding obvious dangers. If the compelled creature is adjacent to Yianyin, it stays still and doesn't act. If the creature takes any damage, the effect ends and the creature is temporarily immune to Compel Condemned for 24 hours. This effect lasts for 1 round, but if Yianyin uses this ability again on subsequent rounds, it extend the duration by 1 round for all affected creatures.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but damage does not end the effect."
