The haunt then rolls initiative.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]].\n\n**Failure** The creature becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]].\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature feels as if the wrathful haunt is particularly enraged at them. The creature becomes frightened 2; their frightened condition doesn't decrease automatically as long as the haunt remains active, and the hatchet gains a +2 circumstance bonus to all wrathful hatchet Strikes it attempts against the creature."
