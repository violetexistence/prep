A Medium or smaller creature becomes trapped inside the cage ([[Actions/Escape|Escape]] DC 20). A Large or larger creature takes 2d6+5 bludgeoning damage and is knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] as the cage bounces off the creature's body, becoming destroyed in the process.\n\n**Critical Failure** As Failure, but a Medium or smaller creature is also struck by the cage, knocked prone, and then takes 2d6+5 bludgeoning damage and is [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] by the cage as it lands on a limb."
