    desc: "  When Theiltemar is destroyed, his bones explode as the necromantic energy holding him together is released. This shreds his rusted chain mail as well, flinging rusty shards of jagged metal in all directions. Adjacent creatures take 2d6 piercing damage (`DC 21 Reflex check` save) and are exposed to rust creep. As his remains settled to the floor, the wall of force blocking area **F14** flickers and fades."

As the affliction progresses, their bodies—as well as the clothing and items they wear or carry—increasingly break down until a painful death occurs. If a character successfully resists contracting rust creep, or recovers from a case of rust creep, they are temporarily immune to future rust creep infections for 24 hours.\n\n**Saving Throw** `DC 15 Fortitude check`\n\n**Stage 1** –1 status penalty to Athletics checks (1 day)\n\n**Stage 2** as stage 1 (1 day)\n\n**Stage 3** [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]] (1 day)\n\n**Stage 4** enfeebled 1 and [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]], plus any armor, clothing and items you carry and that are of a level equal to or less than the disease become broken as the decay spreads to them (1 day; broken items remain broken)\n\n**Stage 5** [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]] (1 day)\n\n**Stage 6** unconscious (1 day)\n\n**Stage 7** death"

Male variant skeleton

Among the ranks of the dead, none are so numerous, nor so varied, as the skeleton. While most are almost entirely made from bone, some maintain a few scraps of flesh to aid them in movement, such as wing membranes.
