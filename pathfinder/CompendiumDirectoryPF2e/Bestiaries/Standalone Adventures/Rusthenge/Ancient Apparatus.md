    desc: "`pf2:r` **Trigger** The ancient apparatus takes damage or an attempt to disable it fails\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The ancient apparatus begins to grind and churn faster. Its soft ticking whirs up to a discordant buzzing sound, and the entire thing begins to glow with an unsettling rust-colored light. All living creatures in area **D3** experience the unsettling taste of rust in their mouths and must succeed on a `DC 18 Fortitude check` save to avoid becoming [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]]. The ancient apparatus then rolls initiative."

  - name: "Rust Creep"
    desc: "passive (disease, divine) Those afflicted by rust creep develop uncomfortable rust-colored bruises on their flesh and endure full-body aches like those one might experience after a long workout. As the affliction progresses, their bodies—as well as the clothing and items they wear or carry—increasingly break down until a painful death occurs. If a character successfully resists contracting rust creep, or recovers from a case of rust creep, they are temporarily immune to future rust creep infections for 24 hours.\n\n**Saving Throw** `DC 15 Fortitude check`\n\n**Stage 1** –1 status penalty to Athletics checks (1 day)\n\n**Stage 2** as stage 1 (1 day)\n\n**Stage 3** [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]] (1 day)\n\n**Stage 4** enfeebled 1 and [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]], plus any armor, clothing and items you carry and that are of a level equal to or less than the disease become broken as the decay spreads to them (1 day; broken items remain broken)\n\n**Stage 5** [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]] (1 day)\n\n**Stage 6** unconscious (1 day)\n\n**Stage 7** death"

  - name: "Routine"
    desc: "(3 actions) The ancient apparatus emits beams of rust-colored light, spending an action to make ranged Strikes against three targets in area **D3**. The apparatus can target creatures as if it possessed darkvision, but has no ability to discern between friend or foe. It can't target a creature more than once, and if there are more than three targets, it selects its targets from those it can see in the room randomly. The ancient apparatus has only 1 action as long as its Hit Points are below its BT."
  - name: "Reset"
    desc: "The ancient apparatus reverts to its non-active mode and resets automatically at the end of any round in which there are no obvious targets to attack."
