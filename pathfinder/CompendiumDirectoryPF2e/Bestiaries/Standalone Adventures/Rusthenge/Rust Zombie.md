If a character successfully resists contracting rust creep, or recovers from a case of rust creep, they are temporarily immune to future rust creep infections for 24 hours.\n\n**Saving Throw** `DC 15 Fortitude check`\n\n**Stage 1** –1 status penalty to Athletics checks (1 day)\n\n**Stage 2** as stage 1 (1 day)\n\n**Stage 3** [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]] (1 day)\n\n**Stage 4** enfeebled 1 and [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]], plus any armor, clothing and items you carry and that are of a level equal to or less than the disease become broken as the decay spreads to them (1 day; broken items remain broken)\n\n**Stage 5** [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]] (1 day)\n\n**Stage 6** unconscious (1 day)\n\n**Stage 7** death"

Plague zombies are infested with hideous contagions.

A zombie's only desire is to consume the living. Unthinking and ever-shambling harbingers of death, zombies stop only when they're destroyed.
