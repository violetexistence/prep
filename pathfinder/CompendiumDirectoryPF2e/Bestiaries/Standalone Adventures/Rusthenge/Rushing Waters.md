The rushing waters vanish instantly upon striking the pit floor, but do leave everything down there sopping wet.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature withstands the force of the rushing waters and is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature takes 1d10 bludgeoning damage as the rushing waters slam them into a cave wall.\n\n**Failure** The creature is knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] by the rushing waters, takes 1d10+6 bludgeoning damage, and is pushed by the water to the spiky pit trap and triggers the trap.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature can't attempt to [[Actions/Grab an Edge|Grab an Edge]] if they fall into the spiky pit trap."
