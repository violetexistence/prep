    desc: " (disease,divine) These undead inflict rust creep with their jaws Strikes.

As the affliction progresses, their bodies—as well as the clothing and items they wear or carry—increasingly break down until a painful death occurs. If a character successfully resists contracting rust creep, or recovers from a case of rust creep, they are temporarily immune to future rust creep infections for 24 hours.\n* * *\n\n**Rustcreep**\n\n**Saving Throw** `DC 15 Fortitude check`\n\n**Stage 1** –1 status penalty to Athletics checks (1 day)\n\n**Stage 2** as stage 1 (1 day)\n\n**Stage 3** [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]] (1 day)\n\n**Stage 4** enfeebled 1 and [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]], plus any armor, clothing and items you carry and that are of a level equal to or less than the disease become broken as the decay spreads to them (1 day; broken items remain broken)\n\n**Stage 5** [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]] (1 day)\n\n**Stage 6** unconscious (1 day)\n\n**Stage 7** death"

Variant severed head

The most common beheaded appears simply as a rotting head, barely preserved by the magic that created it.

* * *

Beheaded are the reanimated heads of decapitation victims. These mindless undead fly through the air or roll around to attack their prey.
