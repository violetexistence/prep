Vloriaks rise from the sinful souls of those whose acts of sabotage resulted in despair and terror, and they delight in the destruction of mortal artifice. Often called despoiler demons, vloriaks were the followers of Xar-Azmak. Their numbers have dwindled over the eons since the Lord of Rust's death; those that exist now are scattered throughout the Abyss. Their chitinous bodies and faceted eyes give them an insectile appearance.

## Vlorian Influence

Vloriaks hail from the otherworldly realm of Vlorus, and as such carry within themselves the potential for decay and rusting ruin. Other creatures that dwell in Vlorus—particularly fiends who rise to power there—can gain similar powers over rust as well. The Vlorian cythnigot encountered earlier in this adventure is an example, but fiends of any type can become infested with unique rust-themed abilities if they hail from this otherworldly realm.
