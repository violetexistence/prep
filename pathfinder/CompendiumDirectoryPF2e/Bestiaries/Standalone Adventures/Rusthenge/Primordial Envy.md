This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

The primordial envy is most often found in underground ruins within Edasseril. It hungers for magic, leaching it from any source it can come into contact with. This hunger can be exploited by clever adventurers who bait it with powerful destructive magics. A primordial envy is one of the most defensive sin oozes, and it tends to layer abjuration spells over itself to both increase its resilience and empower its attacks.

* * *

Thassilon's ruins contain numerous sources of raw magical power that have been lost or forgotten. As many of these sources are steeped in sinful soul energy used by the runelords to enhance their power, some of these sources go "sour," forming into a sinsludge—a mucky effluvium that develops into a barely rudimentary consciousness based on the emotion behind the sin.

## Other Sinsludges

The primordial envy is the least dangerous sinsludge. The glistening pride's shimmering visage lures victims, then curses them with an inflated and competitive ego that tends to get them killed. The crusted sloth leaves victims wallowing in lethargy until they starve, while the shimmering greed imprisons would-be treasure seekers within shells of precious metal. The slithering lust's sweet scents enthrall victims with their deepest desires, distracting them as it feeds. But the most terrible of the sinsludges are the ravenous wrath, which uses blasts of devastating energy to feed, and the rancid gluttony, which consumes souls and leaves bodies behind as lethal undead.
