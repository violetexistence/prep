    desc: "`pf2:r` **Trigger** A Small or larger creature approaches within 15 feet of the double door to area **D9**.\n\n**Effect** The entire room rotates, its west half descending as its right half rises, forming a 45ยบ slope down to the west. All creatures in the room fall [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] and slide toward the west wall (a creature adjacent to the north or south wall can attempt to arrest this fall with a DC 20 check to [[Actions/Grab an Edge|Grab an Edge]]) and take 2d6 + 5 piercing damage (`DC 20 Reflex check`) as they land among the spears. At the same time, the warhammer-wielding statues to the east slide downward on chains to smash into the lower wall; each person in the trap is subjected to a sliding statue Strike."
