  - name: "Raise Bone Wall"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (divine) **Frequency** once per day\n\n**Requirements** Drazmorg is in the Lower Vault of Droskar's Crucible\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Drazmorg draws upon the necromantic energy that infuses the area and causes a tangled wall of bones to rise from the ground. The wall is 5 feet thick, 10 feet wide, and 10 feet tall; once created, it's permanent until Drazmorg uses this ability again, whereupon a previously created bone wall (such as the one at area **G2**) crumbles. The bone wall has AC 10, Hardness 10, and 25 Hit Points. It's immune to critical hits and precision damage, and it heals damage to itself at a rate of 2d6 Hit Points at the end of a round. Everything on each side of the wall has greater cover from creatures on the opposite side, and the wall can't be moved through. A destroyed section of the wall of bones can be moved through freely and no longer heals damage. A creature caught in a space when a bone wall is created must attempt a `DC 25 Reflex check` save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected, and the bone wall fails to form in any square occupied by that creature.\n\n**Success** The creature is forced into an adjacent square of its choice as the bone wall forms in its previous space.\n\n**Failure** As success, but the creature is also knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]].\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature also takes 4d6 piercing and 4d6 bludgeoning damage from the force of being struck by the bone wall."

  - name: "Wight Spawn"
    desc: " (divine) A living humanoid slain by a wight's claw Strike rises as a [[Monster Core/Wight|Wight Spawn]] after 1d4 rounds. This wight spawn is under the command of the wight that killed it. It doesn't have Drain Life or Wight Spawn and becomes [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 2]] for as long as it is a wight spawn. If the creator of the wight spawn dies, the wight spawn becomes a full-fledged, autonomous wight; it regains its free will, gains Drain Life and Wight Spawn, and is no longer clumsy."
