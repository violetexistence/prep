    desc: "`pf2:2` (manipulate,move) **Requirements** King Merlokrep is adjacent to at least one enemy\n* * *\n\n**Effect** King Merlokrep whips his fabulous satin cloak into the face of an adjacent creature and attempts an `Intimidation check` check against that creature's Will DC. On a success, the creature is humiliated and distracted by the act and is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the end of King Merlokrep's next turn. King Merlokrep then Strides up to his Speed and gains a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against reactions triggered by this movement. He must end this movement in a space that isn't adjacent to any enemy."

  - name: "Rise From Death"
    desc: "  If King Merlokrep is slain, the Crown of the Kobold King glows brighter with an awful yellow radiance; this light slithers down inside the dead kobold's flesh, emanating from within as his body begins to twitch and writhe. If the Crown is allowed to remain on his head for 3 rounds, King Merlokrep rises from death as an undead Kobold King-this restores him to full hit points and grants him the Undead trait (along with void healing and susceptibility to vitality energy). Once the undead king is defeated, he remains destroyed-the absorbed energy of the Third Seal allows him to Rise from Death only once. If the Crown is removed before 3 rounds pass, the light winks out, and the energy absorbed by the Third Seal dissipates harmlessly."
