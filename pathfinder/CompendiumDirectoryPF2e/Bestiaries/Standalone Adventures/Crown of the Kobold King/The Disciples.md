Variant unrisen

An unrisen is a mangled conglomeration of splintered bones, decaying organs, and rotting flesh, created when a ritual such as resurrect goes catastrophically wrong. Immense care must be taken, for if the ritual is a critical failure, an unrisen can be the resultâ€”as many a ritualist has learned to their horror.

Unrisen are barely intelligent, aware only of the agony constantly inflicted by their flawed creation and their resentment for the living. They tend to attack the casters involved in the botched ritual first before lashing out at everyone else around them. Though an unrisen's twisted form is unrecognizable as the intended target of the resurrection, its wordless howls are often disturbingly similar to the deceased's voice. If an unrisen is destroyed before it can rise again, it's reduced to a handful of metallic blue-green salts referred to as essential salts.
