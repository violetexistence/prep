    desc: "`pf2:r` **Trigger** Someone attempts to open the doors, or the doors take enough damage to become broken;\n\n**Effect** The heavy metal doors are spring-loaded to slam downward, dropping like a drawbridge to smash all creatures in a 10-foot-square before the doors. All creatures in this area must attempt a `DC 21 Reflex check` save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature lurches to the side and takes no damage-move the creature to a square of the creature's choice adjacent to the trap's area of effect.\n\n**Success** The creature takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage and is pushed into an adjacent square just outside the trap's area.\n\n**Failure** The creature takes 6d8 bludgeoning damage, is pushed into an adjacent square just outside the trap's area, and falls [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] in that square.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature takes 12d8 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. The heavy doors pin the creature to the ground, Immobilizing it ([[Actions/Escape|Escape]] DC 22). A non-[[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] character can lift the doors by Forcing them open with a successful `DC 22 Athletics check` check so that an immobilized character can crawl to safety."
