    desc: "`pf2:r` **Trigger** A creature walks into a large pit's square;\n\n**Effect** The triggering creature falls into the pit but can attempt a `DC 18 Reflex check` save to [[Actions/Grab an Edge|Grab an Edge]] to avoid falling. On a failure, a creature falls 20 feet into an eye-filled pit. The eyes cushion the fall so the 20-foot fall inflicts only 5 bludgeoning damage, but they also completely obscure vision; a character is effectively blind as long as they remain in the pit. The walls of the pit are slick, though a character can [[Actions/Climb|Climb]] them with a successful `DC 25 Athletics check` check."
