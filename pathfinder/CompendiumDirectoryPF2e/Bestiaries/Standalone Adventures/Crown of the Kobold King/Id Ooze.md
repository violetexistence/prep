Not all oozes are mindless predators capable of little more than ambushing and consuming prey. The id ooze is a thinking, calculating creature with the capacity to carry out complex plots and plans-not always to secure a meal. Left to its own devices, an id ooze is just as content to spend decades or even centuries in introspective philosophical pursuits as it is to crawl through the underground rivers and moist caverns it prefers to call home.

An id ooze can derive sustenance from the consumption of organic material, but without easy access to plants or animals to eat, they can subsist in a state of semi-hibernation for centuries while slowly absorbing residual psychic energies in locations that have been host to powerful emotions, such as long-standing temples that once hosted generations of worshippers, settlements that endured horrific wars or devastating disasters, or even just the home of a powerful occult spellcaster whose thoughts left marks upon the walls long after they moved on.

An id ooze prefers water but is equally at home on land. The slimy creature appears as a patch of water until it attacks, when its gelatinous body piles up on itself to form a single pseudopod that strikes like an angry snake.
