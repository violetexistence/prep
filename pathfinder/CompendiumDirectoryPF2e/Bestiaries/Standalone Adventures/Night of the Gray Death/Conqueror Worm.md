Tremorsense functions only if the monster is on the same surface as the subject, and only if the subject is moving along (or burrowing through) the surface."

  - name: "Mental Invader"
    desc: "`pf2:r` (mental,occult) **Trigger** A creature communicates telepathically with the conqueror worm (even to respond to the conqueror worm's telepathy or through a mental spell like [[Spells/Sending|Sending]]) or fails a saving throw against a mental spell cast by the conqueror worm\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The conqueror worm infects the mind of the creature, allowing it to mentally contact the creature from afar. The creature must attempt a `DC 48 Will check` saving throw and is temporarily immune for 1 year.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected and can't be affected by the conqueror worm's Mental Invader ever again.\n\n**Success** The target is [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] for 1 minute.\n\n**Failure** As success, and the conqueror worm can target the creature with telepathy and mental spells regardless of distance, so long as the worm and target are on the same plane. This bond is permanent and can be broken only by [[Spells/Miracle|Miracle]], [[Spells/Wish|Wish]], or similar magic. The conqueror worm can maintain a maximum of 10 connections with Mental Invader. If another creature would be infected, the worm must choose to one of its existing connections end, or if the worm prefers to keep its current 10 connections, the new creature isn't infected instead.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, and for as long as the mental link lasts, the target uses an outcome one degree of success worse than the result of its saving throw against mental spells cast by the conqueror worm."

  - name: "Telepathic Escape"
    desc: " (incapacitation,mental,occult,possession) When the conqueror worm dies, it telepathically projects its consciousness into a creature infected by its Mental Invader ability and who is on the same plane as the conqueror worm. The creature must succeed at a `DC 48 Will check` save or it is overtaken by the conqueror worm. This has the same effect as the [[Spells/Possession|Possession]] spell with an unlimited duration, except the conqueror worm has wholly foregone its physical body. A host body possessed by a conqueror worm undergoes terrible changes. Every day, the host must succeed at a `DC 48 Will check` or become permanently [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] (or increase its stupefied value by 1) and increasingly pale, balding, and bloated. When the host reaches stupefied 4, an ectoplasmic cocoon forms around it. Over the next 24 hours, the host undergoes a swift metamorphosis and emerges as a new conqueror worm with all the memories of its previous incarnation. At this point, the host is dead and can't be restored except by [[Spells/Miracle|Miracle]], [[Spells/Wish|Wish]], or similar magic. Before that point, however, this horrid transformation can be ended by any effect that expels the conqueror worm's possession, meaning would be slayers of a conqueror worm had best locate its consciousness and end the possession before it's too late and the worm rises again."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Swallow Whole|Swallow Whole]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (attack) Huge, 4d10+10 bludgeoning plus 2d6 acid, Rupture 44\n* * *\n\nThe monster attempts to swallow a creature of the listed size or smaller that it has grabbed or restrained in its jaws or mouth. If a swallowed creature is of the maximum size listed, the monster can't use Swallow Whole again. If the creature is smaller than the maximum, the monster can usually swallow more creatures; the GM determines the maximum. The monster attempts an `Athletics check` check opposed by the grabbed creature's Reflex DC. If it succeeds, it swallows the creature. The monster's mouth or jaws no longer grab a creature it has swallowed, so the monster is free to use them to Strike or Grab once again. The monster can't attack creatures it has swallowed.\n\nA swallowed creature is [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]], is [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]], and has to hold its breath or start suffocating. The swallowed creature takes the listed amount of damage when first swallowed and at the end of each of its turns while it's swallowed. If the victim [[Actions/Escape|Escapes]] this ability's grabbed condition, it exits through the monster's mouth. This frees any other creature grabbed in the monster's mouth or jaws. A swallowed creature can attack the monster that has swallowed it, but only with unarmed attacks or with weapons of light Bulk or less. The swallowing creature is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] against the attack. If the monster takes piercing or slashing damage equaling or exceeding the listed Rupture value from a single attack or spell, the swallowed creature cuts itself free. A creature that gets free by either Escaping or cutting itself free can immediately breathe and exits the swallowing monster's space.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Engulf and Swallow Whole|Effect: Engulf and Swallow Whole]]\n\nIf the monster dies, a swallowed creature can be freed by creatures adjacent to the corpse if they spend a combined total of 3 actions cutting the monster open with a weapon or unarmed attack that deals piercing or slashing damage."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Improved Grab|Improved Grab]]"
    desc: "  **Requirements** The monster's last action was a successful Strike that lists Improved Grab in its damage entry, or the monster has a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]\n* * *\n\n**Effect** If used after a Strike, the monster attempts to [[Actions/grapple|grapple]] the creature using the body part it attacked with as a free action. This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead spend an action to use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."
