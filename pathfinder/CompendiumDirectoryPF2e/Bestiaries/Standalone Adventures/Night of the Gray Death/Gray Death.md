    desc: "`pf2:1` (curse,mental,occult,possession) **Frequency** once per round\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The gray death chooses a living creature within 30 feet. The target must succeed at a `DC 42 Will check` save or a fragment of embittered soul-stuff lodges within the target's spirit and turns it against its allies. While the target has this fragment, it doesn't count as anyone's ally for the purposes of providing flanking, and a would-be ally casting a spell that normally works only on an ally on the creature must succeed at a DC 42 counteract check (level 20) or the spell has no effect. The fragment fades after 24 hours."
