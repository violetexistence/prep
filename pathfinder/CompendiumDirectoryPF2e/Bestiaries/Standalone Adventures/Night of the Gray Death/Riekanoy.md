  - name: "Beckoning Dance"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,incapacitation,mental,primal,visual) The riekanoy sways in a compelling fashion. Each non-fey creature within a 300-foot emanation that can see the riekanoy must attempt a `DC 38 Will check` save. The effect lasts for 1 round, but if the riekanoy uses Beckoning Dance again on subsequent rounds, the duration extends by 1 round for all affected creatures. Once a creature succeeds at any save against Beckoning Dance, that creature is temporarily immune for 24 hours.\n\n**Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Fascinated|Fascinated]] and must spend each of its actions to move closer to the riekanoy, avoiding obvious dangers. If a beckoned creature is adjacent to the riekanoy, it stays still and doesn't act. If attacked by the riekanoy, the creature is freed from captivation at the end of the riekanoy's turn.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but if attacked by the riekanoy, the creature can attempt a new save only at the start of its next turn, rather than being freed at the end of the riekanoy's turn."

The riekanoy moves each creature they succeed against up to 10 feet and each creature they critically succeed against up to 20 feet. This movement must all be within reach of its hair."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Improved Grab|Improved Grab]]"
    desc: "  **Requirements** The monster's last action was a successful Strike that lists Improved Grab in its damage entry, or the monster has a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]\n* * *\n\n**Effect** If used after a Strike, the monster attempts to [[Actions/grapple|grapple]] the creature using the body part it attacked with as a free action. This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead spend an action to use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."
