    desc: " (healing) When a leshy dies, a burst of primal energy explodes from its body, restoring 2d8 healing Hit Points to each plant creature within a 30-foot emanation. This area is filled with plants of the same type as the leshy, becoming difficult terrain. If the terrain isn't a viable environment for these plants, they wither after 24 hours."
