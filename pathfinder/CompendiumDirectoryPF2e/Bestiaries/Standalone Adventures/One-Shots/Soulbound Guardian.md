    desc: "  A soulbound guardian shares fragments of its donor soul's personality, though none of that creature's memories. This causes a soulbound guardian to match a strong personality trait of its donor soul. Because of its soul sliver, a soulbound guardian is not immune to spirit as most constructs are."

    desc: "`pf2:3` (concentrate,manipulate) **Frequency** once per day\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The soulbound guardian lends some of the energy animating it to other inanimate objects in the area. Three Small items or pieces of furniture within 60 feet come to life for 1 minute. These objects have the minion trait, though all the objects can act when the soulbound guardian uses a single action to issue them commands. The soulbound guardian can also issue commands to each object as part of using this ability.\n\nEach object animated in this way has a Speed of 20 feet and can make an unarmed melee Strike at +11 that deals 1d6+3 bludgeoning damage. In addition, each object has an AC of 16, a Hardness of 3, and 14 Hit Points."
