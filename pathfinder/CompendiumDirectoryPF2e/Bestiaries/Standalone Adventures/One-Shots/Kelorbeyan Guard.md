    desc: "`pf2:r`  **Trigger** A creature within the monster's reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The monster attempts a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, the monster disrupts that action. This Strike doesn't count toward the monster's multiple attack penalty, and its multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike."

    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** The Kelorbeyan guard has one hand free, and their target is in reach of that hand\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The guard makes a melee Strike while keeping one hand free. If the Strike hits, they grab the target using their free hand. The creature remains [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] until the end of the guard's next turn or until it [[Actions/Escape|Escapes]], whichever comes first."

  - name: "Knockdown"
    desc: "`pf2:2`  The Kelorbeyan guard makes an attack to knock a foe off-balance, then follows up immediately with a sweep to topple them. The guard makes a melee Strike. If it hits and deals damage, they attempt an Athletics check to [[Actions/Trip|Trip]] the creature they hit. Both attacks count toward their multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after they've made both."
