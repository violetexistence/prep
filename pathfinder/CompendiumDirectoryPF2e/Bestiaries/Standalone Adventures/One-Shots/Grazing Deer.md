    desc: "(2 actions) The grazing deer takes one action to move about, and then one action to eagerly nibble at a randomly chosen PC. A character who spends three actions on their turn to Stride can avoid being nibbled by the grazing deer during the hazard's next turn. If all of the PCs do so, attempt a `DC 5 Flat check`-on a success, the party escapes the deer and can proceed onward to Petalbrook, but they become delayed as a result of having to flee the pack of ravenous deer."
