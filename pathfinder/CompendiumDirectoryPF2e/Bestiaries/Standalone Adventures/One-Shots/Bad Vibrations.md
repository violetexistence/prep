    desc: "(3 actions) The hazard loses 1 action for each crystal that's disabled or destroyed. On each of the trap's actions, one of the crystals fires a blast of sound at a single Small or larger creature in the room. The target is randomly determined and takes 1d8 sonic damage (`DC 20 Fortitude check`); a target who critically fails this save is [[Conditions/Deafened|Deafened]] for 1 minute. At the end of the hazard's routine, attempt a `DC 10 Flat check`. On a success, one of the crystals shatters and is destroyed."
