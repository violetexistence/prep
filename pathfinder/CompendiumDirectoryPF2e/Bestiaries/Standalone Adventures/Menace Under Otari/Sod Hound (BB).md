Earth elementals such as sod hounds make excellent bodyguards for spelunkers and are ideal protectors of important subterranean locations. Coming from the Plane of Earth, they often appear in caverns deep underground.

Sod hounds take the form of mossy canines made of packed dirt and pebbles. They can band together with other sod hounds, traveling as a pack.
