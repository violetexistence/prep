Centipedes are relatively common arthropods that live, hunt, and scavenge amid dung and detritus. Scurrying about with surprising speed on the scores of legs attached to their long, segmented bodies, centipedes strike with poisoned mandibles.

Most giant centipedes (known as sewer centipedes when found in cities) nest in small groups but hunt alone. Attempts to domesticate giant centipedes to use as guardians or pets generally end poorly, but some goblin and kobold societies have developed effective methods of utilizing these vermin as guardians. Some societies roast and eat centipedes, often with pungent peppers, as a savory delicacy, although care must be taken in preparing the meal to avoid contaminating the flesh with the creature's venom.
