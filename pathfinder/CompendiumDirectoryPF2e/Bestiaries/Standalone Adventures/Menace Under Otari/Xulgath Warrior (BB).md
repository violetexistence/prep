Reptilian humanoids living underground, xulgaths (known as troglodytes to many surface dwellers) attack intruders in their territory on sight. They live in familial communities, battling rival groups and other aggressive underground inhabitants to survive. They occasionally raid surface settlements, usually at the behest of cruel, bloodthirsty leaders. A typical xulgath has dull gray, dark gray, or ashen scales with a long tail and bony protrusions down the length of their spine.
