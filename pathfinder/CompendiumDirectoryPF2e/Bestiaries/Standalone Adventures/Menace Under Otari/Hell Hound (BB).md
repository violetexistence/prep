Temperamental and quick to aggressive behavior, hell hounds are fiendish canines from a hellish plane. They're skilled hunters and can breathe supernatural gouts of flame from their maws. A hell hound's appearance leaves no doubts as to its infernal origins-flesh the color of burning pitch, teeth as sharp as any fiend's pitchfork, and a shroud of ever-burning hellfire are all trademark features. Though they can't speak, they understand Diabolic, the language of Hell.
