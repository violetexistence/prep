Wolves roam forests, hills, and other wild lands, where they live and hunt in packs. Contrary to popular belief, these packs aren't led by the strongest in the group, but typically consist of a mated pair, their pups, and juvenile offspring from previous mating seasons. Offspring generally leave their parents' pack upon reaching maturity, at which point they seek out mates of their own to form their own packs elsewhere. Wolves don't typically view humanoids as prey animals, but extraordinary circumstances can lead wolves to attack people, especially in winter months and other situations where traditional prey (such as deer and elk) are scarce.
