Wargs are often mistaken for wolves, but they have a cunning intelligence and the ability to speak. Wargs often form hunting parties with orcs and hobgoblins. Most wargs are amenable to this arrangement, but if food should run out, wargs are more than willing to integrate goblinoid flesh into their diet.
