Goblins find fire totally fascinating. It makes light. It's great for cooking. It's a fun toy! Some goblins take their people's admiration of fire a little bit too far and into the realm of deadly obsession.

Goblins who turn their attentions to magic so they can learn to make fire from nothing are known as goblin igniters. These flame fanatics can be a great boon to a band of goblin raiders eager to torch their enemies and wreak havoc. More often, however, their presence is a double-edged sword. In the heat of the moment, goblin igniters sometimes lose sight of their goals and simply set fire to anything that will burn-including their own allies!
