    desc: "`pf2:r` When pressure is placed on any floor tile, the door falls, closing off the hallway. The stone slab deals 3d8 bludgeoning damage to anyone beneath or adjacent to the slab when it drops and pushes them out of its space in a random direction. A creature that succeeds at a `DC 17 Reflex check` save takes no damage and rolls out of the way in a random direction. On a critical success, they roll out of the way and can choose which direction.\n\nLifting the fallen slab requires a successful `DC 25 Athletics check` check. Hitting the floor panels triggers the trap. The slab uses the same AC and saves as the trap, but it has Hardness 12, HP 48 (BT 24)."
