The typical orc trooper is a violent combatant familiar to many adventurers. Orc warriors fight for their holds, for riches, and-perhaps most of all-for glory. Proving their own strength improves their station within their orc hold, so battle is a crucial part of life for any orc who aspires to one day lead or go down in history.
