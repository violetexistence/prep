Ogres embody cruelty and brutish, amoral violence. Standing 10 feet tall and densely muscled, ogres are as strong as they are cruel. They typically enjoy remorseless violence in all of its forms. Although they prefer to vent their violent urges on smaller humanoids-the smaller, the better-ogres promise a horrifying fate for anyone unlucky enough to fall within their meaty grasp.

Always eager for mayhem and murder, ogre warriors are quick to turn on their kin when there's a shortage of smaller folk to torment, so those who lead ogres do their best to keep them constantly distracted with new opportunities for raids and ruin. An ogre's deficits in both patience and intelligence make them easy to trick, giving cunning captives many ways to get the better of them.
