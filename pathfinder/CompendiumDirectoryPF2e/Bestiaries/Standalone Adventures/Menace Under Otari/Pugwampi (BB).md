    desc: " (mental,primal) Creatures other than animals, gremlins, and kholo within 20 feet become extremely unlucky. They must attempt a `DC 16 Will check` save, rolling this Will save twice and using the worse result.\n\nOn a successful save, the creature can't be affected by pugwampi unluck auras for 24 hours. On a failure, the creature must roll twice and use the worse result on all checks as long as it's within 20 feet of the pugwampi.\n\nMultiple pugwampis don't create any increased effect."

Gremlins are cruel fey tricksters and saboteurs who enjoy causing inventive destructiveness. Dog-faced pugwampis are craven, and they take great joy in the accidents and missteps caused by the ill fortune they magically project.
