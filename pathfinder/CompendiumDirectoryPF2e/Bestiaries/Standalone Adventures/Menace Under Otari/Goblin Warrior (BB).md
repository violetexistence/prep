The frontline fighters of goblin tribes prefer to fight in large groups-especially when they can outnumber their foes by at least three to one. One doesn't need intense training or great toughness to become a goblin warrior. Anyone can aspire to this role, or be drafted into it during an emergency.

Goblin warriors delight in wreaking havoc. They think nothing of slaughtering livestock, stealing infants, or burning down buildings purely for momentary delight. They revel in playing malicious tricks on taller humanoids, whom they call "longshanks." What the goblins lack in consistency, long-term planning, and good sense, they make up for in sheer bravery and commitment.
