These stealthy and cruel creatures delight in spreading fear and tormenting their victims. Bugbears are the monsters lurking in the closet and hiding under the bed. Preying on remote farmsteads, bugbears reveal their presence with thumps in the night or creaking boards, inspiring dread, suspicion, and fear in those they torment.
