Fire elementals are destructive manifestations of the Plane of Fire. They sometimes come to the world in powerful places of heat and flame where elemental vortexes form, such as in volcanoes.

Cinder rats are oversized rodents made of smoldering charcoal and elemental fire. Noxious fumes continually bellow from their flaming flesh. Much like terrestrial rats, cinder rats seek out secluded dens and can quickly multiply in number if left unchecked.
