    desc: "  Any creature that touches the mimic (usually from a fist Strike, the mimic's pseudopod, or a [[Actions/Grapple|Grapple]] or [[Actions/Shove|Shove]]) must succeed at a `DC 23 Reflex check` save or gain the [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] condition. The DC to [[Actions/Escape|Escape]] is 23. A melee or thrown weapon that hits the mimic sticks to it. A character can spend an action to attempt a `DC 23 Athletics check` check, removing the weapon on a success. The adhesive dissolves 1 minute after the mimic dies."

Thought to be the result of a failed experiment meant to animate objects or a sinister alghollthu creation, mimics are clever monsters that can take the form of common manufactured objects. Mimics are ambush predators and voracious eaters, surprising their prey through their uncanny ability to mimic the form of common furniture and miscellany. They remain disguised until unsuspecting adventurers happen by, then they lash out in ambush.

Mimics possess complex alien minds, and while often cruel and self-serving, they also enjoy conversation with their prey from time to time. For unknown reasons, they are especially interested in humanoids. Mimics have a strong dislike for others of their kind and tend to live alone. A mimic can remain in its alternate form for an extremely long period of time, sometimes remaining disguised in a dungeon chamber for decades. Regardless of how long it waits, the mimic remains vigilant and alert, ready to strike at any moment.
