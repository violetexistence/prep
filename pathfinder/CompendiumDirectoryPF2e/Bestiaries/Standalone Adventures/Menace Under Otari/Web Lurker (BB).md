Web lurkers, known also as ettercaps, are ugly monsters that not only dwell within the lairs of spiders and swarms, but actively cultivate and shepherd such vermin. Web lurkers hunt in forests, swamps, or scrubby hill lands. They construct structures from their webs high up in trees or within craggy, high canyons, and they surround their territory with traps constructed of the same webbing and natural material.
