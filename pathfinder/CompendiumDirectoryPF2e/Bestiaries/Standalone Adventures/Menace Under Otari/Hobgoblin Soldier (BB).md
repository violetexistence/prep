Hobgoblins are singularly devoted to war, and their entire civilization is built upon fostering and maintaining conflict while simultaneously proving their superiority in battle. Highly organized, they work efficiently and effectively in groups, whether that group is a small raiding party, a roving war band, or a fully regimented army. Physically, hobgoblins stand about as tall as humans and have gray, ashen skin.
