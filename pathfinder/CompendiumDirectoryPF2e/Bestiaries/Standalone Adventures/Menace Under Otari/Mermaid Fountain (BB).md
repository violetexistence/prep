    desc: "Each turn, the fountain uses 1 action. Roll a 1d10 and look up the result on the following list to determine which action it uses that round.\n\n*   **1-4 Single Target** The statue spins about and sprays water at a single random target in the room. Roll a 1d4 and count to the number you rolled, starting with the player on your left, to determine which hero gets attacked. The spray is a ranged Strike.\n*   **5-7 Corner Spray** The statue spins about, firing a spray of water at each corner of the room that still has a functioning corner mechanism. This hits any creature adjacent to the corner mechanism, dealing 2d6 bludgeoning damage. Each hero must attempt a `DC 15 Reflex check`, taking no damage on a critical success, half damage on a success, full damage on a failure, and double damage on a critical failure.\n*   **8-9 Half Room** The statue spins about, spraying half of the room with water. Roll any die. If the result is even, it sprays the west half; otherwise, it sprays the east half. This deals 2d6 bludgeoning damage to each creature in that half of the room, and each hero must attempt a `DC 15 Reflex check` save.\n*   **10 Full Room** This works just like the half-room attack, but it targets everyone in the room."
