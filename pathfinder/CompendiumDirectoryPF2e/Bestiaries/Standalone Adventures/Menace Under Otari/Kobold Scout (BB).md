Most kobolds encountered outside of a well-defended warren or lair are kobold scouts, trained for stalking and the hunt. They're charged with bringing food and valuable goods back to the community. Kobolds are skilled at working together by necessity, and they often set up ambushes or hit-and-run assaults that allow them to do the most damage possible without putting themselves at much risk.
