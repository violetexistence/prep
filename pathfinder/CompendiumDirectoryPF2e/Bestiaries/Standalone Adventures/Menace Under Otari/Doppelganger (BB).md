    desc: "`pf2:r`  When the doppelganger is transformed with Change Shape and another creature moves adjacent to them or uses a Strike or another hostile action against them, the doppelganger can use its reaction to revert to its natural form and make a Strike against that creature.\n\nIf the creature was unaware the doppelganger was in disguise, that creature has the [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] condition against this Strike."

    desc: "`pf2:1` (arcane,concentrate,polymorph) The doppelganger takes on the specific appearance of any Small or Medium humanoid it has seen. This doesn't change the doppelganger's Stride speed or their attack and damage bonuses with their Strikes, but it might change the damage type their Strikes deal (typically to bludgeoning)."

Doppelgangers can transform into perfect copies of other creatures but have indeterminate forms in their natural states.
