Each member of this family of venomous snakes has long, hinged fangs that inject potent venom into their prey. Different vipers inject different types of venom, which might result in paralysis, extreme pain and swelling, blood clotting, or even the sudden stopping of the victim's heart.

Though far less of an imposing physical threat than a giant viper, a common viper poses far more danger than its size would suggest. A viper mainly hunts small mammals or lizards but will attack a humanoid it perceives as a threat.
