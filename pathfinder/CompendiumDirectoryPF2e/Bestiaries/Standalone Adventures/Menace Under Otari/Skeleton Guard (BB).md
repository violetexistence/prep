Made from bones held together by foul necromancy, skeletons can often be found haunting old dungeons and patrolling forgotten cemeteries. Many evil masterminds prefer to keep eternally vigilant undead as minions to avoid the upkeep required to feed and satisfy the psychological needs of living guardians.

Simple skeleton guards remain the most common skeletal minions. These skeletons are mindless, meaning they can't truly reason but can execute their basic guard duties of watching out for and attacking intruders. A group of several skeletons defending the same location usually consists of melee fighters and archers who shoot arrows from afar.
