Snakes come in an array of forms, from jungle-dwelling constrictors that wrap around their prey to venomous vipers with deadly bites. Regardless, all snakes consume their prey whole by unhinging their jaws and using powerful muscles to move the food down their throats and into their stomachs.

The giant viper's fangs, nearly as long as daggers, easily inspire fear. The venom injected by a giant viper can cause severe blood clotting and inflict tremendous damage.
