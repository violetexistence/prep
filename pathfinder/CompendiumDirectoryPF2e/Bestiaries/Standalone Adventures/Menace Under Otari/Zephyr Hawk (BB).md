Air elementals, such as a zephyr hawk, appear in a variety of sizes and shapes. From the Plane of Air, zephyr hawks are often summoned to be used as airborne messengers. Air elementals can also arrive spontaneously during powerful storms and tornadoes where elemental vortexes form.

Zephyr hawks appear to be made of clouds, with distinct shapes that give them the appearance of having the wings and beaks of birds. When one sees clouds that resemble animals, they're often unknowingly observing air elementals. Zephyr hawks sometimes drift among wind currents in great flocks called casts.
