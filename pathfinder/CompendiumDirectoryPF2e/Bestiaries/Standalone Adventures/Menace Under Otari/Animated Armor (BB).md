Objects can be given a semblance of life through the use of rituals or other strange magic, turning them into animated objects. These objects move, work, and fight based on the commands given to them by their creators, who usually set them on guard duty or have them perform menial labor.

Suits of animated armor might serve as guardians, but sometimes high-end martial academies use them as training partners. They're most often found in wizards' laboratories and ancient dungeons.
