A zombie's only desire is to consume the living. Unthinking and ever-shambling harbingers of death, zombies stop only when they're destroyed. Among the living dead, zombies are most often used as fodder, wearing down defenses before more powerful undead arrive to deal the killing blow. Zombies can't truly think for themselves, but they can be commanded by other allied undead and powerful necromancers.
