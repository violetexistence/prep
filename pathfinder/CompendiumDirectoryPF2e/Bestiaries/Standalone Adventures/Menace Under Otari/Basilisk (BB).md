If the creature fails this save when it already has the slowed condition from this ability or Petrifying Glance, the creature is permanently turned to [[Conditions/Petrified|Stone]].\n\nA creature petrified in this manner that is coated with fresh basilisk blood is instantly restored to flesh. A single basilisk contains enough blood to coat up to 2 creatures in this manner."
