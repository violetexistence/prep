Harpies are an amalgamation of human and bird, using their ancestral control of the wind to lure prey or even directly pull in their next meal. Harpies can eat most creatures, but prefer to eat humans and elves in particular. Harpies live in family groups or larger clans, although they rarely hunt in big groups, preferring to keep most meals for themselves.
