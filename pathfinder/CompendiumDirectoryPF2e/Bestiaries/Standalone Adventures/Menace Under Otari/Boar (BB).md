Foul-tempered and tough, boars are far more dangerous than domesticated pigs. These omnivorous mammals are hunted heavily because their meat is considered a delicacy. Boars are most likely to attack humanoids in self-defense or during their mating season in the winter months, when the males grow an extra inch of tissue to protect their organs as they fight off rivals. In some cultures, boars are trained to become much more aggressive for use as war beasts and guardians. When such boars escape back into the wild, they can become true terrors of the region.
