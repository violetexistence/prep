A monster with [[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Greater Darkvision|Greater Darkvision]], however, can see through even these forms of magical darkness."

Most goblin communities teeter in a state of barely controlled disarray-a collective of creatures operating largely on gut instinct rarely follows any clear direction. Even goblin leaders tend to be impulsive, irresponsible, and generally just not that good at actually leading.

In theory, goblin commandos lead goblin raids. In practice, goblin commandos rarely continue to lead their comrades once a battle has begun. Most shirk their responsibilities in favor of wading into the fray and claiming glory from their kin.
