Forest trolls are dim-witted, gangly giants who stalk the fringes of civilization. They rely on their incredible strength to overpower foes with their vicious claws. A troll's endless hunger drives them to consume a variety of living creatures. Trolls stand anywhere from 12 to 16 feet tall, though they prefer to hunch to lull foes into a false sense of security.
