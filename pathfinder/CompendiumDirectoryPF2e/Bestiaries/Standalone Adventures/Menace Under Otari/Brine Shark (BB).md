Water elementals roam the endless oceans of the Plane of Water. They can be brought to the world with summoning magic or through natural disasters like floods or hurricanes. Though water elementals can be very destructive, they aren't always malicious. Just as water can bring life to those in need, its waves can pound shores and its rains flood cities. Water elementals are similarly difficult to predict.

Brine sharks take forms resembling sharks made entirely of water and are fierce, but among the weaker water elementals. They often slip into mortal oceans, competing with natural predators or even joining schools of flesh and blood sharks.
