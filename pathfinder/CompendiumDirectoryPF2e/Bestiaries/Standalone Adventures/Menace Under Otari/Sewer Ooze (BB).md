    desc: "`pf2:1`  The sewer ooze unleashes a wave of filth, covering all creatures within 20 feet of itself. Each creature in the area must succeed at a `DC 17 Reflex check` save or take 1d4 acid damage and a -10-foot penalty to its Speeds for 1 minute (on a critical failure, the creature also falls over and gains the [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] condition). A creature can Interact to clean someone off. This decreases the Speed penalty to -5 feet after 1 action, or to no penalty after 2 actions. After using Filth Wave, the ooze can't use it again for 1 minute.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Filth Wave|Effect: Filth Wave]]"

These amorphous masses of sewage and detritus make their way through filthy culverts beneath cities. Some grow to enormous sizes and have insatiable appetites.
