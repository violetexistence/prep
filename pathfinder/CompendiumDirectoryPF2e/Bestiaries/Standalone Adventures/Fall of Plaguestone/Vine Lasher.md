    desc: "  Tremorsense allows a monster to feel the vibrations through a solid surface caused by movement. It is an imprecise sense with a limited range (listed in the ability). Tremorsense functions only if the monster is on the same surface as the subject, and only if the subject is moving along (or burrowing through) the surface."

If the creature moves, the vine lasher moves with it, always keeping the grabbed creature within 10 feet of itself.\n\nIf two or more vine lashers have a creature grabbed in this way, then the target's space and adjacent square instead use the rules for greater difficult terrain."

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."
