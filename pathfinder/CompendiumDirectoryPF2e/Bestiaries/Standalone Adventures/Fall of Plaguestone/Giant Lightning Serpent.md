    desc: "`pf2:r`  As Attack of Opportunity, but the serpent can use this reaction only if it's coiled.\n* * *\n\n**Trigger** A creature within the monster's reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The monster attempts a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, the monster disrupts that action. This Strike doesn't count toward the monster's multiple attack penalty, and its multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike."

    desc: "`pf2:2`  The serpent rattles its strange metal tail and unleashes a bolt of lightning in a 60-foot line. The bolt deals 2d10 electricity damage (`DC 17 Reflex check` save).\n\nOnce the giant lightning serpent uses this ability, it must wait 1d4 rounds before doing so again."
