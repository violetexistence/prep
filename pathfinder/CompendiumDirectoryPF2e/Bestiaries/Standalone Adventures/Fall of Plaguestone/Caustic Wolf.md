  - name: "Howl"
    desc: "`pf2:2`  The wolf unleashes a terrifying howl, allowing it to [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] all enemies within 30 feet. Wolves within 100 feet can spend a reaction to join the howl, causing the effect to emanate from them as well. This affects additional enemies within 30 feet of them and uses the caustic wolf's Intimidation check with a -4 circumstance penalty.\n\nEnemies cannot be affected by the howl more than once, even if they are near more than one howling wolf. All creatures targeted by this effect are temporarily immune for 24 hours."
