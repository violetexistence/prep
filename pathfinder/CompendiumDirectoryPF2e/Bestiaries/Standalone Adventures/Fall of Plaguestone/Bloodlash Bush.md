    desc: "  Tremorsense allows a monster to feel the vibrations through a solid surface caused by movement. It is an imprecise sense with a limited range (listed in the ability). Tremorsense functions only if the monster is on the same surface as the subject, and only if the subject is moving along (or burrowing through) the surface."

    desc: "  A bloodlash bush's vines cause terrible lacerations that continue to bleed. A creature hit with a vine attack takes 1 bleed damage (2 bleed damage on a critical hit).\n\nUnlike other forms of persistent damage, this damage is cumulative, to a maximum of 5 persistent bleed damage but it can be stopped like any other persistent bleed damage."

The bloodlash bush attempts to lacerate its foes, using its weeping wounds to irrigate the ground around itself. The seeds of a bloodlash bush can take root only in soil that has been soaked in blood.

Often overlooked in light of more obvious threats, some plants can be just as deadly and dangerous as wild beasts.

What first appears to be a simple shrub suddenly stirs to life.
