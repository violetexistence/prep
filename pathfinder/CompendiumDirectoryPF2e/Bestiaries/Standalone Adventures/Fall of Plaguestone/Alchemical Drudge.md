If the drudge is destroyed, its master automatically knows this. The range of this link is 1,500 feet."

Each hit deals 1d6 points of damage of the same type as that of the bomb loaded into it. Each bomb has enough fluid in it for 10 successful strikes.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Alchemical Strike|Effect: Alchemical Strike]]"

    desc: "`pf2:2`  An alchemical drudge can vomit forth a pool of caustic alchemical reagents, filling the ground in one square adjacent to the drudge. Creatures in that square when the pool is created take 2d6 acid damage (`DC 17 Reflex check`). Any creature that ends its turn in a square containing a pool takes 2d6 acid damage. The pool remains for 1 minute before becoming inert."
