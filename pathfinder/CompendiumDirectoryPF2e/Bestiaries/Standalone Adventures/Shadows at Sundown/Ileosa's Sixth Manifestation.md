    desc: "`pf2:r` (divine, emotion, mental) **Trigger** Someone attempts to contact Ileosa with call spirit and achieves any result other than a critical success to cast the ritual\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Ileosa closes her fingers and attempts to pull the primary caster's heart from their chest. The primary caster must attempt a `DC 33 Fortitude check` save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature takes no damage.\n\n**Success** The creature feels Ileosa's hand grip and tug at their heart; they take 25 void damage, and then the manifestation vanishes.\n\n**Failure** As success, but the creature takes 50 void damage and becomes [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]] as they momentarily see their heart appear in Ileosa's hand before the manifestation vanishes.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature takes 75 void damage and becomes [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 2]]. If this reduces the target to 0 Hit Points, the target dies instantly. For a brief moment, the victim's heart appears in Ileosa's hand before the manifestation vanishes. If the victim is slain by this hazard, their heart drops to the ground with a splat, pulsing its final beats after the manifestation vanishes."
