    desc: "  Abridan is an ex-cleric. While he's lost the magical abilities that come from his connection to Pharasma, he can still use the _major staff of healing_ or any of his scrolls by tricking the item. Since he can't cast spells, he can't recharge his staff, and uses its remaining charges only as a last resort."

    desc: "`pf2:0` (divine) **Trigger** Abridan dies before he's had a chance to atone for his blasphemies or has become an actual cleric of Urgathoa\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Urgathoa watched Abridan's fall from grace, and if he dies before he finishes his conversion, her disappointment causes his body to decay as if he had been dead for a week. This process also causes all living creatures within 30 feet to take 11d6 void damage (`DC 33 Fortitude check`). If steps are not thereafter taken to prevent his soul from returning (such as by casting [[Spells/Peaceful Rest|Peaceful Rest]] on the partially decayed corpse), Abridan rises as a _[[Monster Core/Dybbuk|Dybbuk]]_ on the site of his death a minute after the next sundown and seeks revenge on the PCs for killing him."
