It can cast that spell once; if the spell is of a higher level than half the loreavor's level (5th level or higher for most loreavors), the loreavor must succeed at a flat check with a DC equal to 5 + the rank of the spell it is attempting to cast; on a failure, the spell fails, and the loreavor becomes [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] for 1 minute. If the spell isn't cast within 24 hours, or if the loreavor uses Reconstruct Spell again before casting the spell, the spell is lost. No more than one loreavor can reconstruct a given spell this way."

    desc: " (occult) By spending an hour in contact with a non-magical document or piece of artwork no larger than 1 Bulk, a loreavor can consume either a few words from the text or render the artistry of the work more mundane.

A loreavor can consume incidental text in this manner from a spellbook but cannot consume actual spells recorded in the book. The loreavor can't use Redact for 24 hours."

Rarely, when an ioton leeches a particularly secretive thought, it can choke to death on the secret, only to be born from its previous body into that of a loreavor: an ennosite whose existence is shaped around the consumption of secrets and artistry.

Loreavors sip at secrets throughout their lives and are instinctively drawn to obscure information. Their hunger places them firmly at odds with scholars and historians alike. Living victims lose memories; written texts become blank books. Loreavors' favorite sites are ruins and ancient libraries, but they can also survive on banal secrets of everyday life as well. While the creatures are secretive, typically staying out of sight and fleeing danger, they become aggressive when their favored food sources are threatened.

A loreavor appears as a 3-foot-long, pale, wormlike creature with dozens of half-formed faces growing from its segmented body. Trapped in an area without secrets to eat, a loreavor won't starve and can live for years.
