    desc: "Tiny black flames mirror living creatures' movements in the city above as scraps of shadow patrol the streets-flames that notice intruders in their \"sky\" below and reach out to the intruders \"above\" with a deafening violence that incidentally alerts several of the vault's denizens to the intruders' presence."

    desc: "`DC 40 Thievery check` (master) to adjust the model so its attention is focused inward, `DC 37 Occultism check` (expert) to cause the accumulated psychic energy to discharge harmlessly, or [[Spells/Dispel Magic|Dispel Magic]] (7th rank; counteract DC 32). A character who sneaks through the room with a `DC 32 Stealth check` (expert) check avoids triggering the hazard, but this does not disable it."

    desc: "`pf2:r` (occult) **Trigger** A creature without supernatural ties to the Shadow Plane enters the room (creatures like fetchlings or divine spellcasters who worship Zon-Kuthon represent two examples of creatures who won't trigger this hazard)\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The flickering dark flames on the city's streets flare up and the sound of an entire city populace screaming an alarm fills the room. All creatures in area **C1** take 18d6 sonic damage (`DC 33 Fortitude check`), and all strigoi from Aliriel's Vault immediately know intruders have been spotted in this room. Any strigoi in area **C2** quickly investigate and attack the PCs on sight."
