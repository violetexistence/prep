    desc: "(3 actions) The slicing shadows congeal into the form of what appears to be the upper half of a skeletal, cowled humanoid: an [[Bestiary 3/Owb Prophet|Owb Prophet]]. This owb prophet is a creation of the paradox engine and does not have a forsaken patron. While the owb prophet is active, the paradox engine no longer uses its Slicing Shadows reaction; instead, the owb prophet focuses its attacks on creatures that attempt to damage or deactivate the engine. If the owb prophet is destroyed, the paradox engine's disable DCs and Hardness are reduced by 5. It thereafter functions as a simple hazard with the Slicing Shadows reaction, and resets after 1 round."
  - name: "Reset"
    desc: "The paradox engine deactivates 1 minute, and its owb prophet returns to its interior after all creatures leave the area, but resets immediately thereafter."
