  - name: "Escape From Hell"
    desc: " (auditory,divine,emotion,fear,mental) When Ileosa's shell is reduced to 0 HP, the hollow corpse immediately melts into a pool of blood, at the center of which lies her still-beating heart. A moment later, a crimson ghostly shape-Queen Ileosa's soul-rises from the heart. After the soul shrieks in relief at escaping from Hell, it rises through the ceiling and vanishes while the heart dies and rots. All creatures within 30 feet of the shell when this occurs must attempt a `DC 30 Will check` save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** A living creature becomes invigorated and elated by the sense of freedom from Hell, and becomes [[Conditions/Quickened|Quickened]] for 1 minute. The creature can use the extra action each round only for Strike and Stride actions. An undead creature gains no benefit.\n\n**Success** As success, but the creature can use the extra action only for Stride actions.\n\n**Failure** The creature becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]].\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]]."

The shell becomes [[Conditions/Quickened|Quickened]] for 1 round, and can use the extra action only for fangs Strike actions against a creature that is taking persistent bleed damage. Further damage dealt by the shell increases the enfeebled condition by 1 on a failed save, to a maximum of enfeebled 4."
