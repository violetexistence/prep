  - name: "Divination Immunity"
    desc: "  As a side effect of existing slightly outside the normal time stream, Lorthact is difficult to detect via divination spells and abilities. These effects function as though Lorthact and items he carries are not present, and those specifically targeting him, such as scrying, fail entirely unless the source of the divination is a higher level than Lorthact-in which case they succeed only if the caster succeeds at a secret flat check."

  - name: "Arcane Absorption"
    desc: "`pf2:3` (arcane,manipulate,mental) **Requirements** Any creature adjacent to Lorthact is [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied]], capable of casting prepared arcane spells, and is either [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]], [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]], or willing\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Lorthact attempts to drain a 1st- through 8th-rank prepared spell from the target, who can resist with a successful `DC 37 Will check` saving throw. On a failure or against a willing target, the prepared arcane spell is transferred from that creature as if it were cast, and Lorthact immediately prepares that spell in the same rank slot. If he already had a spell prepared in that slot, the previously prepared spell is lost. That creature is then immune to Arcane Absorption for 24 hours."

  - name: "Arcane Spellcaster"
    desc: "  As long as Lorthact has one arcane spell prepared in this way, all arcane spells are on his spell list, which allows him to activate items such as scrolls, wands, and staves. He can recharge his staff of power as a prepared spellcaster by using his arcane spell slots. He has one spell slot to prepare arcane spells of each level from 1st to 8th, and can prepare any Common arcane spell in these slots during his daily preparations. The spells listed above represent those he most typically prepares, but given time, he can adjust this selection as needed for the task at hand."

  - name: "Scholastic Masquerade"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (arcane,concentrate,polymorph) Lorthact takes on the appearance of Volshyenek Ornelos or reverts to his true form. In Volshyenek's form, he loses his fly Speed and claw Strikes, doesn't inflict additional mental damage with his Strikes, and reduces his AC to 34. He gains a +4 status bonus on Deception checks to appear human in this guise."

  - name: "Staff of Power"
    desc: "  Lorthact's staff of power is tipped with a pair of metal tines that grant the weapon the versatile piercing trait."

  - name: "Thought Theft"
    desc: " (curse,divine,mental) Any creature that takes mental damage from Lorthact's claws or staff must succeed at a `DC 37 Will check` save or become [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] ([[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] on a critical failure). Further mental damage dealt by Lorthact increases the value of the stupefied condition by 1 on a failed save to a maximum of stupefied 4. Whenever Lorthact causes a creature to become stupefied in this way, he absorbs some of those thoughts and gains a +1 status bonus on all Will saving throws and Intelligence-, Wisdom-, or Charisma-based skill checks until the end of his next turn."
