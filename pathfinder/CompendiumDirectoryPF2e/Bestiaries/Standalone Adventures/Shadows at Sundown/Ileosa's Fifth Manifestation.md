    desc: "`pf2:r` (divine, emotion, mental) **Trigger** A living creature moves within 10 feet of where the manifestation will appear\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Ileosa laughs, becoming more substantial as bloody, spectral bodies appear to pile under her feet. Each living creature within 30 feet of the area must attempt a `DC 30 Will check` save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature takes no damage.\n\n**Success** The creature takes 5d10 mental damage as false memories of being tormented and persecuted under Ileosa's rule tear through their mind.\n\n**Failure** As above, but the creature takes 10d10 mental damage and becomes [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] until the next sunrise from the overwhelming nature of the false memories.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature becomes [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] instead. In addition, the creature continues to see dead, bloody bodies crawling from the ground during times of stress, causing them to treat all ground as difficult terrain during combat. This hallucination persists as long as the character remains stupefied from the hazard."
