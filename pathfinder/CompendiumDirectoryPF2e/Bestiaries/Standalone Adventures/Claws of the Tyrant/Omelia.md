    desc: " (occult) +13 skill modifier\n* * *\n\n**Frequency** once per hour\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The ghoul calls upon knowledge it retains from one creature it has consumed in the past 7 days. The ghoul attempts a skill check using a skill in which the consumed creature was trained (if it's unclear whether the creature was trained, the GM decides). The ghoul is treated as trained and uses a +13 modifier. This takes the same amount of actions or time as usual for the check.\n\nThe ghoul can instead automatically learn something specific known by a creature it consumed in the last 7 days, like the location of a [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] treasure or the name of a loved one. The ghoul can do this only once for a given creature, no matter how much of its flesh the ghoul consumed."

The first time Omelia hits her designated prey in a round, she deals an additional 1d8 precision damage. These effects last until she uses Hunt Prey again."

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."
