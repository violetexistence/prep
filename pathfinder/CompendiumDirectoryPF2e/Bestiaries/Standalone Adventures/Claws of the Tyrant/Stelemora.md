Its [[Conditions/Dying|Dying]] condition never increases beyond Dying 3 as long as its regeneration is active. However, if it takes damage of a type listed in the regeneration entry, its regeneration deactivates until the end of its next turn. Deactivate the regeneration before applying any damage of a listed type, since that damage might kill the monster by bringing it to Dying 4."

Stelemoras are nature-loving fey dedicated to beautifying the natural world by ensnaring unsuspecting creatures and transforming their bodies into elaborate topiaries from the inside out. Aside from their bulbous, spiked seed pods, stelemoras are composed entirely of vines, which they can grow, retract, and shed at will. Stelemoras regrow damaged vines at an alarming rate, allowing them to recover from nearly any injury over time.

Young stelemoras travel the world looking for a piece of wilderness to call their own. Once they select a proper spot, they use their vines to snare passing creatures, holding their target still as they forcibly implant their seeds inside the victim. The implanted seeds then take root, using the creature itself as fertilizer and slowly transforming its body into a mass of vines and leaves. Once they complete their work, the stelemora sheds their vines and regrows in a new location to begin their next masterpiece.

While stelemoras prefer to fill their gardens with once-living creatures, they entomb inanimate objects in vines if they can't capture their preferred subjects. Stelemoras have also been known to transform statues, treasure chests, and even entire buildings into topiaries in order to lure in their favored prey.
