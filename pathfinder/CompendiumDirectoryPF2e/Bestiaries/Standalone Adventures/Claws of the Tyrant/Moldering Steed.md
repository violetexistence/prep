A moldering steed is a horse whose unshakable will couldn't be broken, even by death. Draped in rotting flesh and trailing its own stinking entrails, the steed fights unrelentingly against its undead state, seeking out the spirits of strong-willed creatures to consume in a vain attempt to repair its fractured soul. Once it catches a scent, the steed pursues its prey until it consumes the creature's spirit or finds stronger-willed prey to track.

The few moldering steeds that arise naturally often died attempting to escape desperate situations, such as floods or fires. More often, necromancers create moldering steeds to serve as mounts for their undead armies. Unlike living mounts, moldering steeds don't need to be fed or cared for, and they'll often accept an undead rider who allows them to hunt down living prey. Due to the steed's insatiable hunger, however, living necromancers must take care not to become their steed's next meal.
