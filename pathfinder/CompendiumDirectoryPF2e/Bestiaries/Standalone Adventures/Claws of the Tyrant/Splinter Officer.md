An army of mindless undead possesses a fatal flaw: it requires near-constant babysitting from its maker. Yet, any undead with enough sentience to command such an army runs the risk of turning on its creator. Skilled necromancers have endeavored to strike a balance between these two extremes with the creation of splinter officers. Capable of leading small battalions of undead, splinter officers are at the same time uniquely bound to their creatorâ€”and easily disposed of should they ever decide to go rogue.

The first splinter officer was created when a lich separated his soul cage into multiple parts and implanted each shard into a unique undead champion, over which the lich enjoyed complete control. Ultimately, the lich decided the risk to his soul cage wasn't worth the benefits, but the technique of soul-splitting proved too useful to abandon. Today, splinter officers are created by plucking an intelligent creature's soul from Pharasma's clutches at the moment of the creature's death. The fresh soul is then shattered, with the splinter officer receiving the largest portion and the remaining splinters being implanted into the mindless undead soldiers the officer controls.
