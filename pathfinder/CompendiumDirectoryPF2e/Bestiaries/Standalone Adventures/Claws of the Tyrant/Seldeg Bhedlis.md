    desc: "`pf2:r`  **Trigger** An enemy within 15 feet damages Seldeg\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Seldeg puts an impertinent foe who dared harm him in their proper place. He commands the enemy to kneel in obedience. If they refuse, they must pay the price in pain and anguish. The triggering creature must choose one of the following options: the enemy kneels, dropping [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] as a free action, or the enemy refuses and takes 6d6 mental damage. In addition, Seldeg's Strikes against the triggering creature deal an additional 3 damage until the end of his next turn. Seldeg chooses whether the additional damage is spirit or void each time he uses this reaction."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Reactive Strike|Reactive Strike]]"
    desc: "`pf2:r`  **Trigger** A creature within the monster's reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The monster attempts a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, the monster disrupts that action. This Strike doesn't count toward the monster's multiple attack penalty, and its multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike."

    desc: " (divine) When a graveknight is destroyed, their armor rebuilds their body over the course of 1d10 days—or more quickly if the armor is worn by a living host. If the body is destroyed before then, the process restarts.\n\nA graveknight can only be permanently destroyed by obliterating their armor (such as with [[Spells/Disintegrate|Disintegrate]]), transporting it to the Forge of Creation, or throwing it into the heart of a volcano."

    desc: "`pf2:r`  **Trigger** The monster has its shield raised and takes damage from a physical attack.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The monster snaps its shield into place to deflect a blow. The shield prevents the monster from taking an amount of damage up to the shield's Hardness. The monster and the shield each take any remaining damage, possibly breaking or destroying the shield."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Void Healing|Void Healing]]"
    desc: "  A creature with void healing draws health from void energy rather than vitality energy. It is damaged by vitality damage and is not healed by vitality healing effects. It does not take void damage, and it is healed by void effects that heal undead."

    desc: "`pf2:3` (arcane,summon) **HP** 155; **AC** 42, **Fort** +32, **Ref** +28, **Will** +29\n* * *\n\nSeldeg summons a supernatural mount, as [[Spells/Marvelous Mount|Marvelous Mount]] (rank 10). Unlike _marvelous mount_, the steed's AC and saving throw bonuses are all 4 lower than the graveknight's, and the steed has one-third the Seldeg's Hit Points (rounded down).\n\nIf the steed is destroyed, Seldeg must wait 1 hour before using this ability again."
