To all appearances, the copy is an exact duplicate of the original object but is in fact a worthless reproduction. The counterfeit object is real but has no magical properties and is treated as a shoddy item if used as a weapon or tool. The copied object can be identified with a DC 35 check to Recall Knowledge with Crafting (or with a skill related to the item; for instance, Religion for a copied religious symbol), though the DC drops to 25 if the object is more than 40 feet away from the mirmicette who created it."

Mirmicettes are materialistic fey who obsessively collect small tools, household goods, and similar trinkets. Though not particularly malevolent, mirmicettes consider the items they collect more interesting than the sentient creatures who create them. They have nondescript, unassuming gray faces and spindly fingers that end in clawlike nails, which they use to pluck any item they covet from its resting place.

Mirmicettes wander from place to place in search of treasures to add to their ever-growing collections. When a mirmicette steals an object, they often replace the stolen item with a near-perfect copy. Mirmicette copies are most convincing when the fey is close by, quickly losing their luster as the distance between the mirmicette and the object grows. While this swapping has led to the disappointment of many an adventurer, a loss of material goods is far from the worst outcome one might experience when encountering a mirmicette. Mirmicettes dislike anyone who touches one of their counterfeit items without permission, often using the object itself as a weapon against the would-be thief.
