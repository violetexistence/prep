    desc: "`pf2:r` **Trigger** A creature Strides beneath the portcullis while it is raised\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The portcullis slams down, driving its sharpened ends through a grate in the floor. Creatures directly beneath the portcullis take 3d12+20 piercing damage (`DC 40 Reflex check` save). The portcullis is made of adamantine and has Hardness 31 and 120 HP (BT 60). The trap then rolls initiative."

  - name: "Routine"
    desc: "(1 action) A cloud of acidic vapor rises from the grate beneath the portcullis in a 5-foot emanation. Any creature that enters the area or starts its turn inside the cloud takes 3d12+20 acid damage (`DC 40 Fortitude check` save). A creature that critically fails the save also takes 1d12 persistent acid damage. Each time the hazard uses this routine beyond the first, increase the radius of the emanation by 5 feet."
  - name: "Reset"
    desc: "Once triggered, the trap must be manually reset by raising the portcullis. Once all the vials are smashed, the trap can't use its routine again until the vials are replaced."
