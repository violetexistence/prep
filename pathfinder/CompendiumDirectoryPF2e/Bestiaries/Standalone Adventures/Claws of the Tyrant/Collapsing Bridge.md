    desc: "`pf2:r` **Trigger** A Medium or larger creature steps onto the bridge's weak point\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The bridge collapses in the creature's square, then rolls initiative. The DC to [[Actions/Grab an Edge|Grab an Edge]] on the bridge is 38. Once the bridge begins to collapse, the river's [[Actions/Swim|Swim]] DC increases to 36 as the water churns with the falling debris. A creature that starts its turn swimming within 15 feet of the bridge takes 10d6 bludgeoning damage (`DC 41 Reflex check` save)."
