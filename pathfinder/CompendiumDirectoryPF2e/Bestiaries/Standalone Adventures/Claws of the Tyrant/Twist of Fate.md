    desc: "`DC 44 Arazni Lore check` or `DC 44 Iomedae Lore check` to recount a tale from history that grounds that deity in the current reality, `DC 50 Crafting check` (legendary) to create a device to siphon energy from the ritual circle, or `DC 46 Religion check` (legendary) to discharge the escalating divine energy; six successes (three successes per circle) are required to disarm the hazard."

    desc: "`pf2:r` **Trigger** A creature other than Seldeg enters the area contained by the ritual circles\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Arcs of divine energy travel between the two circles. Each creature within the circles takes 4d10+26 spirit damage (`DC 45 Fortitude check` save). If one of the ritual circles has been disabled, the hazard instead affects all creature in the room, but each creature gains a +2 circumstance bonus to their save. The hazard rolls initiative."

  - name: "Routine"
    desc: "(1 action; divine) The divine energy gathered by the ritual spikes. One of the eleven stained-glass windows (each depicting one of her Eleven Acts) transforms to feature Arazni instead. Any creature that can see the window change must attempt a `DC 50 Will check` save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected and is immune to this effect for 10 minutes.\n\n**Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Failure** The creature takes 3d12+20 mental damage.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature takes 6d12+40 mental damage. If the creatures' next d20 roll is a critical success, they earn a critical failure instead. This is a misfortune effect. If all 11 windows transform, Seldeg's ritual finishes ahead of schedule. The stained-glass windows shatter, dealing 8d10+52 piercing damage (`DC 50 Reflex check` save) to each creature in the room. The hazard then becomes inactive."
  - name: "Reset"
    desc: "While atop the floating platform, Seldeg Bhedlis can use a 3-action activity with the auditory trait to reenergize the ritual. Doing so removes one success to disable the hazard and immediately triggers the hazard's Reorder Reality reaction."
