    desc: " (divine) Onturat taps into the memories of the creatures whose bones make up his body. This gives him the Skeletal Lore skill, which he can use to [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] of any kind. In addition, he can speak and understand all the languages known by the creatures whose bones make up his body (typically Common and the regional language of the skulltaker's home region). Onturat can use Skeletal Lore as the primary skill check for the [[Spells/Collective Memories|Collective Memories]] ritual, and he can cast collective memories without secondary casters."

  - name: "Splintered Ground"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  The skulltaker causes splintered bones to erupt from all solid surfaces in a 100-foot emanation, except for surfaces of worked stone. A creature moving through the bones takes 10 piercing damage and 10 void damage for every 5 feet of movement. The first time each round a creature takes piercing damage from these splintered bones, it must succeed at a `DC 42 Reflex check` save or take a –10-foot circumstance penalty to all Speeds for 10 minutes, or a –15-foot circumstance penalty for 24 hours on a critical failure. The bones remain in place until the skulltaker uses this action again or the bones are manually removed, which takes 10 minutes for each 5-foot square.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Splintered Ground|Effect: Splintered Ground]]\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Splintered Ground (Critical Failure)|Effect: Splintered Ground (Critical Failure)]]"

Variant skulltaker

Swirling down from misty peaks and through howling mountain passes like an evil wind, the vortex of bones known as a skulltaker is a terrible manifestation of the delirium and agony experienced by doomed climbers and lost trailblazers just before they met their end. In some places, a skulltaker is also known as a saxra.
