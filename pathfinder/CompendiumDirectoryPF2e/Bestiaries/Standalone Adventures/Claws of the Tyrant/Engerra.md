Born of those who sacrificed their lives for something greater than themselves, engerras resemble swarms of glowing fireflies and are sometimes mistaken for will-o'-wisps or simple tricks of the light. They are most often encountered in the tombs of legendary heroes but might linger anywhere such a hero has drawn their final breath.

Engerras believe that tales of worthy sacrifice hold great power. They gather the memories of those who died in service of a noble cause and then share those memories with mortals who might be inspired or cheered by them. An engerra's trademark glow is a sign of both sorrow and hope, for it simultaneously associates the death of a great hero with the determination to honor that hero's legacy.
