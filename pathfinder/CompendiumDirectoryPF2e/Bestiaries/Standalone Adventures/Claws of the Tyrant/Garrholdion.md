A garrholdion is also bound to a location associated with its faction, such as a fortress, an academy, or a secret hideout. It can't move more than 120 feet from its designated location. Finally, a garrholdion bears an obvious mark of its faction somewhere on its body. This mark can't be hidden."

Belief is a powerful force. When strong-willed individuals gather beneath a common banner, their unified conviction can take on a life of its own. The result is a garrholdion, a spirit construct that defends the meeting place of the faction that created it.

A garrholdion usually appears as a shimmering, idealized version of a typical faction member, though it might instead shift its appearance among that of specific individuals, never settling on just one. Whatever form it takes, a garrholdion is always marked by its faction's symbol. A Firebrands garrholdion, for example, bears that faction's crossed swords symbol, while a Pathfinder Society garrholdion is marked with the Glyph of the Open Road.
