  - name: "Bounding Leap"
    desc: "`pf2:2`  Globblit [[Actions/Leap|Leaps]] twice; this movement doesn't provoke reactions. If he ends his movement within melee reach of at least one enemy, he can make a melee Strike against that enemy."

  - name: "Commanding Croak"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (auditory) Globblit gives a loud, belching croak to compel his allies to action. Each boggard within 30 feet can use a reaction to Step, Stride, or Strike."

  - name: "Smash and Slurp"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Frequency** once per turn\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Globblit makes a greatclub Strike and a tongue Strike against the same target. If the greatclub Strike hits, the target is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] against his tongue Strike.\n\nThis counts as two attacks for Globblit's multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after his Smash and Slurp."

  - name: "Swamp Stride"
    desc: "  Globblit ignores difficult terrain caused by swamp terrain features."

  - name: "Tongue Grab"
    desc: "  If Globblit hits a creature with his tongue, that creature becomes [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] by him. Unlike a normal grab, the creature isn't [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]], but it can't move beyond the reach of Globblit's tongue.\n\nA creature can sever the tongue by succeeding at an AC 18 Strike and dealing at least 6 slashing damage. Though this doesn't deal any damage to Globblit, it prevents him from using his tongue Strike until it regrows, which takes a week."
