A sand wolf is an elemental creature which dwells in the sandy deserts of elemental earth that drift to, or have been conjured on, the Plane of Air. Occasionally, these creatures seep through planar rifts or are summoned by elementalists on the Material Plane. Sand wolves are prized as guardians for their relative intelligence, keen perception, and ability to disguise themselves, easily blending with the shifting sands in desert terrain. Cunning and agile, they fiercely pursue any creatures they ambush, no matter how nimble their prey. Sand wolves also have a remarkable ability to sing beautiful, haunting songs, and their music is considered high entertainment among djinn who inhabit the Plane of Air. Many djinni viziers and even certain Material Plane rulers seeking the attention of their peers keep at least one of these creatures in their employ to show off at special events and ceremonies. The wolves' wordless songs evoke both the strength of the earth and the power of wind to erode it.

## The Eternal Hourglass

Deep within a cavern in the Plane of Earth is a massive, seemingly indestructible hourglass the size of a small city, its top filled with thousands of sand wolves. As each wolf reaches the opening to the bottom, they are turned to sand and do not reform, instead piling up in a huge mound. It is not clear who constructed or placed the hourglass, how the sand wolves got there, or what—if anything—the hourglass is timing. Some claim the wolves will break loose and rampage freely when the sand runs out, while others believe the glass is counting down to the end of time itself.
