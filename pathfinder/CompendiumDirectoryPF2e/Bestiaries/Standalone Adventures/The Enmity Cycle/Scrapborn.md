In places where magic, alchemy, and engineering converge, there are often unforeseen side effects on the environment and its inhabitants. Scrapborn sometimes result from this strange convergence. Mostly, scrapborn appear to be walking piles of assorted junk, seemingly assembled at random. Their actual bodies are vaguely humanoid with delicate, spongy green skin. They secrete an adhesive that allows them to gather up debris and attach it to their bodies for protection. When these scraps eventually fall off, the scrapborn either reattaches them or replaces them with something new. Despite their resulting bulky appearance, scrapborn remain strong swimmers and display little loss of agility underwater. Scrapborn lack a centralized society, but sometimes congregate in small groups that work together for survival. Typically, this leads to ever-escalating attacks on nearby settlements as the creatures feed upon each other's resentment and work themselves up into a frenzy. They often target places with high-quality armor first so they can improve their odds of survival.

## Pretend Knights

Some scrapborn spend a great deal of their time carefully selecting the pieces of armor and other bits they attach to their sticky skin. They might enjoy a particular color or material and cultivate their collection accordingly, striving for a cohesive design over time. A very diligent and patient—or particularly wealthy—scrapborn can even construct a full suit of armor this way and might even be able to pass as a knight, using their bulky armored form to bluff and intimidate anyone who might question them as they walk through a city or castle.
