    desc: " (curse,primal) A group of six jinkins can work together for an hour to imbue an item with a curse at a range of 60 feet. While this process is lengthy, it's also unobtrusive and can be performed while [[Actions/Hide|Hiding]]. Jinkins prefer to use this ability on magic items. The curse makes the item unreliable (`DC 5 Flat check` or waste any action to Interact with or Activate the item), adds a bizarre requirement to use the item, or imparts some other curse of a similar caliber."

    desc: "`pf2:3`  Noolik can cause a complex mechanical trap to continue longer than its normal duration. She moves up to her speed and Interacts with a trap. The trap can use its reaction during its next round as well as its routine, although its initiative doesn't change."
