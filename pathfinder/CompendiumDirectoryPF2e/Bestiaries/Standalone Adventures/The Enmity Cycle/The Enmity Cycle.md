    desc: "(1 action) The performance continues to sow seeds of enmity, discord, and distrust on those in its area. All creatures in attendance other than Zridi must attempt a `DC 25 Will check` save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected and is immune to the effects for 1 day.\n\n**Success** The target is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]] for 2 rounds.\n\n**Failure** The target is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] for 1 minute and is certain the source of this fear is their fellow citizens, especially those from places other than their hometown. For 1 week the target suffers a â€“2 penalty to all Diplomacy skill checks against people from other Thuvian cities and regains the frightened 2 condition whenever they are in one of those cities.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target becomes a carrier for _The Enmity Cycle_ for the next week. The target is compelled to travel to a city other than where they were exposed and recite as many lines from the anbarit as they can recall. Those who hear or witness the performance are treated as if they had attended a performance of _The Enmity Cycle_, but with a `DC 23 Will check` save"
