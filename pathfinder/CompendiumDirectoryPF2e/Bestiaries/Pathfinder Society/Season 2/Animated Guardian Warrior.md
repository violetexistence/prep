    desc: "  Like normal objects, the animated guardian has Hardness. This Hardness reduces any damage it takes by an amount equal to the Hardness.\n\nOnce the animated guardian is reduced to less than half its Hit Points, or immediately upon being damaged by a critical hit, its construct armor breaks and its Armor Class is reduced to 15. It also loses its hardness."

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."
