A giant crab flipped onto its back has a particularly hard time defending itself; instead of taking the normal -2 circumstance penalty to AC for being [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]], it takes a -4 circumstance penalty to AC."

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."
