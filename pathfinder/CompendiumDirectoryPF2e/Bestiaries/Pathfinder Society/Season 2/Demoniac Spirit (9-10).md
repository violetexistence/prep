    desc: "  The spirit has been absorbing energy through the ritual so it can transform itself once Urxehl manifests. Once the total value of all of the drained conditions the spirit has inflicted with drain life reaches 3, it loses its incorporeal trait as its body becomes solid. The spirit loses all of its immunities and resistances, it gains 40 Temporary Hit Points, and its Strength bonus increases to +0."
