    desc: "`pf2:r` **Trigger** A creature walks on to the Drandlesticks\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The triggering creature must succeed at a `DC 30 Acrobatics check` check or take 1d4+11 piercing damage, 2d6 precision damage, and 2d4 bleed. A creature taking persistent bleed damage from the Drandlesticks takes a -10-foot penalty to its Speed.\n\nAdditionally, a creature damaged by the Drandlesticks is targeted by a [[Spells/Command|Command]] spell (`DC 28 Will check` save) with orders to release everything it's holding; if the creature fails the save and drops what it's holding, there is a 50% chance that the high winds blow the object or objects off the edge of the Colossus."
