    desc: "`pf2:1` (primal,water) The mist stalker makes its mist cloud congeal, causing the aura to be difficult terrain until the start of the mist stalker's next turn. In addition, the mist stalker can make the mist even thicker around a single Medium or smaller creature within the cloud. The creature must succeed at a `DC 18 Reflex check` save or become [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] until it Escapes or it is no longer in the mist cloud's emanation."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Grab|Grab]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** The monster's last action was a successful Strike that lists Grab in its damage entry, or the monster has a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]\n* * *\n\n**Effect** If used after a Strike, the monster attempts to [[Actions/grapple|grapple]] the creature using the body part it attacked with. This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."
