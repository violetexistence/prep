    desc: "`pf2:r` The storm of wind and fire suddenly surges over everyone in the area. When this hazard activates, roll 1d10 to determine the effect and type of damage.\n\n*   **1-2 Firestorm** Embers and burning debris gets whipped around as the wind suddenly shifts direction, dealing 1d10 bludgeoning damage and 1d10+13 fire damage (`DC 25 Reflex check` save).\n*   **3-4 Battering Debris** Wreckage rains down throughout the area, dealing 2d10+13 bludgeoning damage (`DC 25 Fortitude check` save).\n*   **5-6 Abyssal Energy** The storm blows about debris that has absorbed Abyssal energies. Creatures who come into contact with this debris are exposed to Abyssal plague.\n*   **7-8 Sharp Rain** The storm picks up various objects, some of which are particularly sharp. The storm deals 1d10 bludgeoning damage and 1d10+13 piercing damage (`DC 25 Reflex check` save).\n*   **9-10 Soot Storm** Large amounts of soot blow in on the wind. The soot moves with supernatural malice, seeking out the lungs of any creatures caught nearby. Any creature that needs to breathe must succeed at a `DC 25 Fortitude check` save or become [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] (sickened 2 on a critical failure). The sickened condition can't end or be reduced until a creature has spent 10 minutes breathing clean air."
