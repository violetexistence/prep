    desc: "`pf2:r` **Trigger** A creature walks onto the ice slick\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The target must attempt a Athletics check to [[Action Macros/Balance_ Acrobatics|Balance]]. If it fails this check, it falls [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] and slides 10 feet in the direction it was moving when this reaction was triggered. If this movement is stopped by a wall, the target takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 5 feet of prevented movement. If this forced movement moves the target through another creature's space, that other creature must succeed at a `DC 14 Reflex check` save or be knocked prone as well.\n* * *\n\n5 foot damage: 1d6 bludgeoning damage\n\n10 foot damage: 2d6 bludgeoning damage"
