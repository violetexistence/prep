    desc: "  Instead of being bonded to a specific tree, Iverri is bonded to blighted areas formerly ravaged by the Abyss. If she does not remain within 300 feet of at least one blighted tree, she becomes [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] and is unable to recover. She must attempt a `DC 25 Fortitude check` save every hour or increase the sickened value by 1 (to a maximum of [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 4]]). After 24 hours, she becomes [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]], with this value increasing by 1 every additional 24 hours."

    desc: "`pf2:1` (curse,disease) **Frequency** once per day\n\n**Requirements** Iverri's last action was a successful thorn spike Strike that damaged the target\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Iverri transforms the thorns into burrowing maggots, infusing the target with a fell curse to bind it to her. The target must attempt a `DC 22 Will check` save to resist the curse; on a failure, this binding lasts until the end of Iverri's next turn.\n\nWhile the binding is active, Iverri takes only half damage from all effects that deal Hit Point damage, and the target takes the remainder of the damage. When the target takes damage from the bond, it doesn't apply any resistances, weaknesses, or other abilities it has to that damage."
