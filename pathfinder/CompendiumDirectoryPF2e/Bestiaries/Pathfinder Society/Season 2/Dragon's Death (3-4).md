    desc: "The pile of bones transforms into a Large silver dragon, while the PCs appear to transform into dark, shadowy figures of alien physique. The dragon's flesh appears to slowly dissolve into lines of black smoke, which trail away toward the PCs and appear to be absorbed into their bodies. Once the dragon is stripped of flesh, its skeleton explodes in a shower of bone fragments."
