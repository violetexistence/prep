    desc: " (disease) When a blighted fungus leshy dies, a burst of rotted compost explodes from its body, dealing 3d6 slashing damage and 1d6 poison damage to each creature in a 30-foot emanation. This area then fills with blighted fungi, becoming difficult terrain until the fungi wither 24 hours later."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Change Shape|Change Shape]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,polymorph,primal) The blighted fungus leshy transforms into a Small, sickly-looking giant mushroom or patch of fungi. This ability otherwise uses the effects of [[Spells/One with Plants|One with Plants]].\n* * *\n\nThe monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

  - name: "Spore Cloud"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (poison) A blighted fungus leshy can unleash a cloud of spores that irritates the eyes and throats of non-fungi creatures in a 15-foot emanation. Each creature must succeed at a `DC 18 Fortitude check` save or take 2 persistent poison damage. On a failure, a creature has its vision range reduced to 20 feet (10 feet on a critical failure) as long as the persistent damage continues."

  - name: "Spores"
    desc: "  A creature damaged by a blighted fungus leshy's spore pod Strike must attempt a saving throw with the same DC and effect as its Spore Cloud ability."
