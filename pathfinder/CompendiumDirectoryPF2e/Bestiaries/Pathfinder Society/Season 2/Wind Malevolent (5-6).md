    desc: "`pf2:r`  **Trigger** The wind malevolent would be hit by an effect that deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The wind malevolent dissociates into component elemental wisps while vaguely retaining its weasel-like form. This grants it bludgeoning resistance 7, piercing resistance 7, slashing resistance 7, weakness 5 to area damage, and weakness 5 to splash damage. While in this dissociated form, it can't use its vacuum sickle Strike. The wind malevolent automatically re-forms into its normal form at the beginning of its next turn."
