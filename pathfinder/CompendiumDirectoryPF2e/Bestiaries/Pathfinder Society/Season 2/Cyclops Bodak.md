    desc: "`pf2:2` (death,occult,visual) The cyclops bodak stares at a living creature within 30 feet that it can sense with its [[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Lifesense|Lifesense]]. That creature must attempt a `DC 25 Fortitude check` save. If the target becomes [[Conditions/Drained|Drained]], the bodak gains a number of temporary Hit Points equal to 5 times the value of the drained condition the target gained.\n\nMultiple exposures to this ability can increase a creature's drained condition to a maximum of 4. If the cyclops bodak is destroyed, any [[Conditions/Doomed|Doomed]] condition a creature has gained from Death Gaze are removed.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature is [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]].\n\n**Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Doomed|Doomed 1]] and [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 2]].\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature is doomed 1 and [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 4]]."
