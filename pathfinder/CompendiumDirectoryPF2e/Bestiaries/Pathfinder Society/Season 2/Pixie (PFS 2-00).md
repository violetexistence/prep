    desc: "`pf2:1` (manipulate) The pixie sprinkles pixie dust onto one of its arrows. If the pixie hits a creature with that arrow before the pixie's next turn, the arrow inflicts one of the following special effects instead of dealing damage. Each effect depends on the target's Will save. On a critical hit, the target treats its save result as one degree worse.\n\n*   **Charm** `DC 21 Will check` (emotion, enchantment, incapacitation, mental) The target suffers the effects of a [[Spells/Charm|Charm]] spell, except it doesn't gain a bonus to its save if the only hostile act was the pixie firing its bow, and the pixie can choose to direct the target's adoration toward another creature rather than itself.\n*   **Memory Loss** `DC 21 Will check` (divination, mental) On a failed Will save, the target loses the last 5 minutes of its memory.\n*   **Sleep** `DC 21 Will check` (enchantment, incapacitation, mental, sleep) The target suffers the effects of a 3rd-rank [[Spells/Sleep|Sleep]] spell.\n*   **Subdual** `DC 21 Will check` (enchantment, mental, nonlethal) The target takes 4d6 mental damage, depending on its basic Will save."

Insatiably curious, overly excitable, and just a bit puckish, pixies are wanderers and tricksters who use their pixie dust to create all sorts of whimsical situations, as well as to defend themselves. Other creatures often have trouble understanding a pixie's rapid, rambling way of speaking.

* * *

Elusive, flighty, and ebullient, sprites are what many villagers first imagine when they hear the terms "fey" or "fairy." While their dispositions vary from the benevolent grig to the trickster pixie, all sprites share a connection to magic and diminutive size. This family of fey shares its name with its slightest and most populous member, the common sprite.
