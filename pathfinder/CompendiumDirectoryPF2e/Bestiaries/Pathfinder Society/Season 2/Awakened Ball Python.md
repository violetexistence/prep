This nonvenomous snake's name comes from its tendency to curl into a ball when frightened, though most people know it for its hunting tactic of coiling around prey and crushing victims with its powerful muscles. Nonetheless, brave herpetologists sometimes keep ball pythons as pets.

Snakes come in an array of forms, from jungle-dwelling constrictors that wrap around their prey to venomous vipers with deadly bites. Regardless, all snakes consume their prey whole by unhinging their jaws and using powerful muscles to move the food down their throats and into their stomachs.
