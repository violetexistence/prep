    desc: " (aura,mental,visual) 30 feet. Kareida's mask hides her focus in a fight. Enemies that start their turn in the aura or enter it must succeed at a `DC 16 Will check` save or become [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] to Kareida and take a -2 circumstance penalty to saving throw DCs against skill checks Kareida makes against them until the start of their next turn. On a critical success, the foe is temporarily immune for 1 minute. If Kareida is not wearing her scarecrow mask, she loses this ability."
