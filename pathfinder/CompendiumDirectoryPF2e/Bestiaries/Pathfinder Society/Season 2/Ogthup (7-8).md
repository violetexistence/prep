    desc: "  In combat, Ogthup is a minion. Once per round, any PC can spend an action to command Ogthup (this has the auditory, concentrate, and linguistic traits), and have her take two actions. If reduced below 15 HP, Ogthup scampers away and dives into a snowdrift, to return once the coast is clear. If reduced to 0 HP, she falls unconscious rather than dying immediately."
