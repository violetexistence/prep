All squares count as difficult terrain for that creature until the end of Qxal's next turn, and during that time they gain no benefit from any ability that would allow them to ignore difficult terrain."

  - name: "Secret Spells"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  Qxal knows how to disguise the manifestations of their spellcasting to catch their foes off guard. If the next action they use is Casting a Spell that has a verbal component, they can remove the verbal component. This makes the spell quieter and allows them to cast it in areas where sound can't carry. Additionally, if Qxal has cover or greater cover against or is [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] from one or more observers while Casting a Spell, they can attempt a `Stealth check` check against one or more of those observers' Perception DC. If they succeed at their check against an observer's DC, that observer doesn't notice Qxal is casting a spell."

  - name: "Woodland Stride"
    desc: "  Qxal can pass freely through even the densest jungle. They ignore difficult terrain caused by plants, including plants manipulated by magic."
