Roll damage only once and apply it to each creature hit. A counts as two attacks for the multiple attack penalty, though the penalty does not increase until after both attacks are resolved."

  - name: "Wight Spawn"
    desc: " (divine) A living humanoid slain by Valgomorus's claw Strike rises as a spawned wight after 1d4 rounds. This spawned wight is under the command of the wight that killed it (in this case, Valgomorus). It doesn't have drain life or wight spawn and is [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 2]] for as long as it is a spawned wight.\n\nIf the creator of the spawned wight dies, the spawned wight becomes a full-fledged, autonomous wight; it regains its free will, gains drain life and wight spawn, and is no longer clumsy."
