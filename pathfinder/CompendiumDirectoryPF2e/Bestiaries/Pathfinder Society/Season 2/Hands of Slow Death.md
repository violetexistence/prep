  - name: "Description"
    desc: "A pile of dust and bone meal, several inches deep and 10 feet across on each side, blocks the tunnel to the surface. It is suffused with the despair of the slowly dying, and summons vengeful skeletal hands to hunt down anyone who dares attempt to leave the area."

    desc: "`DC 15 Religion check` (trained) to speak the proper burial rites, `DC 15 Occultism check` (trained) to exorcise the lingering souls, or `DC 17 Intimidation check` to scare the fearful souls away.\n\nThese actions have the verbal trait. Each check to disable the hazard requires 2 actions, and two total successes are required to disable the haunt."

  - name: "Summon Crawling Hands"
    desc: "`pf2:r` (occult, summon) **Trigger** A creature comes within 30 feet of the remains\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The haunt summons three [[Monster Core/Crawling Hand|Crawling Hand]], which emerge from the pile of dust to attack nearby creatures. The hands roll initiative and remain for 7 rounds, after which the summoning spell ends and the hands disappear. The hands also disappear if someone disables the trap before the duration expires.\n\nThe summoned hands can use 3 actions each round and can use reactions, unlike most summoned creatures."

  - name: "Routine"
    desc: "(1 action) Spectral hands grasp at creatures in the area. Each creature within 30 feet of the dust pile takes 1d4 void damage (`DC 17 Will check` save; creatures that critically fail this saving throw are [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] for 1 round)."
  - name: "Reset"
    desc: "The haunt deactivates if no creatures remain within 30 feet but resets immediately thereafter unless disabled. If tthe haunt is disabled, it resets after 24 hours."
