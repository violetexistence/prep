    desc: "  The hand of Urxehl begins with 4 fingers embedded outside of the rift. At the beginning of the encounter, the hand is [[Conditions/Quickened|Quickened 1]], and can use this additional action to make grasping claw Strikes. For every 45 damage the hand of Urxehl takes, one of these fingers recedes and the hand loses 1 action, first losing the quickened condition, then becoming [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] and [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 2]] before being defeated at 0 Hit Points."

    desc: "  This monster regains the listed number of Hit Points each round at the beginning of its turn. Its [[Conditions/Dying|Dying]] condition never increases beyond Dying 3 as long as its regeneration is active. However, if it takes damage of a type listed in the regeneration entry, its regeneration deactivates until the end of its next turn. Deactivate the regeneration before applying any damage of a listed type, since that damage might kill the monster by bringing it to Dying 4."
