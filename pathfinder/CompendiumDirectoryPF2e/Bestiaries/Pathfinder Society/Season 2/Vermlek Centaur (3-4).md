  - name: "Inhabit Centaur Body"
    desc: "`pf2:3` (manipulate) While most vermleks inhabit Medium humanoids, Urxehl has granted this demon the ability to inhabit centaurs instead.\n\nThe vermlek crawls into the body of an adjacent dead centaur, consuming the bulk of the victim's skeleton and internal organs as it does so and cramming itself into the cavity.\n\nThe vermlek can wield weapons and use the centaur's Speed, hoof attack, and Trample ability. It also gains a +3 circumstance bonus to AC. While Inhabiting a Centaur body, a vermlek can't burrow.\n\nIt can't use this ability if it's already Inhabiting a Centaur Body."

    desc: "`pf2:3`  Medium or Smaller; Hoof; `DC 21 Reflex check`\n* * *\n\nThe monster Strides up to double its Speed and can move through the spaces of creatures of the listed size, Trampling each creature whose space it enters. The monster can attempt to Trample the same creature only once in a single use of Trample. The monster deals the damage of the listed Strike, but trampled creatures can attempt a basic Reflex save at the listed DC (no damage on a critical success, half damage on a success, double damage on a critical failure)."

  - name: "Unsettling Movement"
    desc: " (emotion,fear,mental,visual) Whenever the vermlek Abandons a Body or Inhabits a Body, all creatures within 30 feet who can see the vermlek must succeed at a `DC 20 Will check` save or become [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]]. On a critical failure, the creature is frightened 1 and [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]].\n\nRegardless of the result, creatures are immune to the same vermlek's unsettling movement for 24 hours."
