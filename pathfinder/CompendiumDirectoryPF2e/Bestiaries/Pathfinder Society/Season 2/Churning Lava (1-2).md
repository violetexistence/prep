    desc: "`DC 14 Nature check` or `DC 14 Survival check` or `DC 17 Thievery check` to clear your square and all adjacent squares of the mold; the churning lava does not target creatures in cleared squares with its spatter attack, but the hazard is not destroyed until every square has been cleared of mold."

    desc: "passive The target must attempt a `DC 17 Reflex check` save as the lava rapidly cools and solidifies. On a critical hit, use the outcome for one degree of success worse than the result of the save.\n\n**Success** The lava slides off the target with no additional effect.\n\n**Failure** The target becomes [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]]. The target or an adjacent creature can take an Interact action to remove the stone, removing the condition.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, except the target becomes [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 2]]. Each Interact action to remove the stone reduces the value of the clumsy condition by 1."

    desc: "If not completely destroyed, the mold spreads to one additional square within 10 feet of lava each day until it fully regenerates and regains its state of equilibrium. If every square is cleaned of mold, the hazard is destroyed."
