    desc: "  Tremorsense allows a monster to feel the vibrations through a solid surface caused by movement. It is an imprecise sense with a limited range (listed in the ability). Tremorsense functions only if the monster is on the same surface as the subject, and only if the subject is moving along (or burrowing through) the surface."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Lifesense|Lifesense 30 feet]]"
    desc: "  Lifesense allows a monster to sense the vital essence of living and undead creatures within the listed range. The sense can distinguish between the vitality energy animating living creatures and the void energy animating undead creatures, much as sight distinguishes colors."

    desc: "`pf2:r`  **Trigger** The giant crawling hand takes piercing or slashing damage\n* * *\n\n**Effect** A random creature adjacent to the giant crawling hand is sprayed with vile pus that deals 2d6 void damage. The affected creature must attempt a `DC 19 Reflex check` save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature takes no damage.\n\n**Success** The creature takes half damage and becomes [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]].\n\n**Failure** The creature takes full damage and becomes [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]].\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and becomes [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 3]]."

  - name: "Mark Quarry"
    desc: "  A crawling hand can be assigned a quarry by anointing the hand with a drop of the intended quarry's blood. If the hand ever has no quarry, it automatically gains the next creature it damages as its quarry. The hand gains a +1 circumstance bonus to Perception checks when it [[Actions/Seek|Seeks]] its quarry, to Survival checks when it [[Actions/Track|Tracks]] its quarry, and damage rolls when it Strikes its quarry."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Grab|Grab]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** The monster's last action was a successful Strike that lists Grab in its damage entry, or the monster has a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]\n* * *\n\n**Effect** If used after a Strike, the monster attempts to [[Actions/grapple|grapple]] the creature using the body part it attacked with. This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."
