An apex predator among the coastal surface waters where it hunts, the great white shark is one of the largest shark species. These silent killers glide gracefully through the ocean, always in search of their next meal.

* * *

Sharks of all shapes and sizes have stalked the oceans, largely unchanged, since primordial times. They are efficient, ruthless predators with multiple rows of razor-sharp teeth capable of rending prey in an instant. Their uncanny ability to smell blood in the water means sharks might show up at any scene of aquatic carnage.
