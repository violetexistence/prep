While any Medium dead body will do, they sometimes throw [[Monster Core/Zombie Shambler|Zombie Shamblers]], who take just as much damage from being thrown as the target they hit. A thrown shambler lands [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]], but if it's not destroyed, it can rise and use other actions normally."

    desc: "`pf2:1`  The zombie hulk makes a hunk of meat Strike and compares the attack roll result to the AC of up to two foes, each of whom must be within the Strike's reach. This attack counts as two attacks for the zombie hulk's multiple attack penalty."

A zombie's only desire is to consume the living. Unthinking and ever-shambling harbingers of death, zombies stop only when they're destroyed.
