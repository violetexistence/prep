    desc: "`pf2:r` **Trigger** The squirrel swam finishes chewing through the rope at the beginning of its turn\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The tree drops 10 feet in front of the wagon, blocking the road. The tree deals 2d8 bludgeoning damage to anyone beneath the tree when it drops and pushes them out of its space in a random direction. A creature that succeeds at a `DC 18 Reflex check` save takes no damage and rolls out of the way in a random direction. On a critical success, it can choose the direction. Mounted creatures do not attempt a save unless their mount attempts a save and fails. If a mounted creature's mount fails the save, the mounted creature can attempt its own `DC 18 Reflex check` save by leaping off its mount, taking 1d4 bludgeoning damage from the fall. This damage is taken whether the save is successful or not."
