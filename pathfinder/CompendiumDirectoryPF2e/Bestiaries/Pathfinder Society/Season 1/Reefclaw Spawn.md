    desc: "  The reefclaws follow the call of the scale, but its siren song affects aquatic aberrations differently than normal animals. While in pursuit of the scale, the reefclaws gain the amphibious trait, gain a +5-foot item bonus to their Speed, and are [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]] (all adjustments already included in their stat block). The reefclaws cannot remove these conditions while within a half mile of the scale."
