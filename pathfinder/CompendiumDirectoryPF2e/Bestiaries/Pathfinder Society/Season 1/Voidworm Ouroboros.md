  - name: "Entropy Sense (Imprecise) 30 feet"
    desc: " (divine,prediction) A voidworm can anticipate the most likely presence of a creature through a supernatural insight into chaotic probabilities and chance. This grants it the ability to sense creatures within the listed range. A creature under the effects of [[Spells/Veil of Privacy|Veil of Privacy]] or that is otherwise shielded from divinations and predictions cannot be noticed via entropy sense."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Constant Spells|Constant Spells]]"
    desc: "  A constant spell affects the monster without the monster needing to cast it, and its duration is unlimited. If a constant spell gets counteracted, the monster can reactivate it by spending the normal spellcasting actions the spell requires."

    desc: "  A monster with this ability regains the given number of Hit Points each round at the beginning of its turn."

  - name: "[[Creature Family Ability Glossary/(Protean) Protean Anatomy|Protean Anatomy]]"
    desc: " (divine) A protean's vital organs shift and change shape and position constantly. Immediately after the protean takes acid, electricity, or sonic damage, it gains the listed amount of resistance to that damage type. This lasts for 1 hour or until the next time the protean takes damage of one of the other types (in which case its resistance changes to match that type), whichever comes first. The protean is immune to polymorph effects unless it is a willing target. If [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] or [[Conditions/Deafened|Deafened]], the protean automatically recovers at the end of its next turn as new sensory organs grow to replace the compromised ones.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Protean Anatomy|Effect: Protean Anatomy]]"

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Change Shape|Change Shape]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,divine,polymorph) The voidworm takes on the appearance of a Tiny animal. This doesn't change its Speed or its attack and damage bonuses with its Strikes, but might change the damage type its Strikes deal.\n* * *\n\nThe monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

  - name: "Confounding Lash"
    desc: " (divine,emotion,mental) A creature hit by the voidworm's tail Strike is [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] for 1 round ([[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] on a critical hit). A successful `DC 22 Will check` save negates this effect and grants temporary immunity to confounding lash for 1 minute."

  - name: "Divide"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (polymorph) In any round the voidworm ouroboros has less than half its total Hit Points, it can split into two standard [[Monster Core/Voidworm|Voidworms]] which assume normal statistics for that creature."
