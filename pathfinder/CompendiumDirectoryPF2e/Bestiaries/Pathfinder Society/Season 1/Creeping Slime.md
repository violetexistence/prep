    desc: "`DC 17 Thievery check` (trained) to carefully push the slime away without causing it to grow, `DC 17 Crafting check` (one action) to neutralize it with alchemical reagents, or [[Spells/Dispel Magic|Dispel Magic]] (2nd rank; counteract DC 15 [DC 18 in Subtier 3-4]) to counteract the magic animating it. Casting a 1st-rank or higher spell with the water trait washes away the slime."

    desc: "`pf2:r` (occult) **Trigger** A creature steps into the slime covering the steps and upper landing.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The slime rapidly climbs across the creature's body, grows cold, and congeals. Creatures assaulted by the slime take 1d8+5 cold damage(`DC 17 Fortitude check` save); creatures that fail their save are also coated in slime, imposing a -5 foot circumstance penalty to their Speeds. The slime can't be easily cleaned away, and it requires ten minutes of bathing with clean water and soap to remove the slime."
