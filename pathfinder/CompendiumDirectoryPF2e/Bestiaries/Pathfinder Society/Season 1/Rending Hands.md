    desc: "`pf2:r` (divine, illusion, mental) **Trigger** A creature passes through area **C2** for the second time in 24 hours.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Phantasmal rotting hands burst out from the floor under the target, tearing into their legs. The hands' appearance varies based on the reason for the haunting (see the table below).\n\nThe hands deal 4d6+10 slashing damage and 4d6 bleed (`DC 21 Will check` save). If a creature takes any damage from the haunt, the claws leave rending wounds on the target's legs, reducing their land Speed by 10 feet (minimum 5 feet) until the target is restored to its maximum HP.\n\n  \n\n| Owners | Haunt Manifestations |\n| --- | --- |\n| Archdevil Worshippers | Scent of brimstone and sound of chanting in Infernal (a PC who understands Infernal or succeeds at a `DC 10 Religion check`, Hell Lore, or Mephistopheles Lore check recognizes the chanting as a prayer to Mephistopheles) |\n| Soulbound Dollmakers | Flesh flaking off the rotting hands reveals smooth porcelain underneath (a PC who succeeds at a `DC 10 Crafting check` or `DC 10 Occultism check` check recognizes the craftsmanship as that of soulbound dolls) |\n| Alchemical Experimenters | A chemical scent overpowers the rot, and precise surgical cuts can be seen on the arms (a PC who succeeds at a `DC 10 Crafting check` or `DC 10 Medicine check` check realizes both are medical but unnecessary) |\n| Slavers | The hands still wear heavy manacles around the wrists |\n| Crime Lords | The hands are tattooed and some are cleanly missing fingers (a PC who succeeds at a `DC 10 Society check` or Underworld Lore check recognizes these as marks of gangs active before the earthquake) |\n| Misguided Pharasmins | A scent of incense lingers as the haunt vanishes (a PC who succeeds at a `DC 10 Religion check` or Pharasma Lore check recognizes the scent from Pharasmin funerals) |"
