    desc: "`DC 22 Religion check` (expert) to exorcise the spirit from one of the containers of water, or `DC 23 Athletics check` or `DC 23 Thievery check` (trained) to overpower the ghostly force sealing a container and drain it. All three containers must be disabled to disable the entire haunt."

    desc: "`pf2:r` **Trigger** A creature opens the door to the haunted chamber\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The manifestation slams the door shut. The force deals 3d8 bludgeoning damage to any creature in or adjacent to the door's space and pushes them into the room. A creature that succeeds at a `DC 22 Reflex check` save takes no damage and rolls out of the way in a random direction. On a critical success, it can choose the direction. The haunt then rolls initiative."

  - name: "Routine"
    desc: "(one action) One creature within the room must attempt a `DC 23 Will check` save as the haunt attempts to drown them.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected and temporarily immune for 1 minute.\n\n**Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Failure** A ghostly version of the creature's face appears in the water of the sink, the bath, or the wash bucket. The creature immediately experiences the sensation of being underwater, and if it can't breathe water, it must begin to hold its breath to avoid suffocation. The haunt can affect only one creature per container remaining in the haunt. If the creature leaves the room, it's immediately freed.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature immediately loses 1d4 actions' worth of air."
