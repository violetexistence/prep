    desc: "(4 actions) The trap loses one action per magical sensor disabled. On its initiative, the trap uses each of its actions to target one creature adjacent to or within an alcove with a negative effect that corresponds to the season opposite the one depicted on the alcove's murals (`DC 27 Fortitude check` to resist). For the purposes of this trap, creatures who are within an alcove's landscape count are within that alcove. The trap can target only one creature per alcove per round.\n* * *\n\n**Spring Alcove (death)** The decay of late autumn takes hold of the target.\n\n*   **Critical Success** The trap has no effect.\n*   **Success** The target takes 2d6+2 void damage.\n*   **Failure** The target takes 4d6+4 void damage.\n*   **Critical Failure** The target takes 4d6+4 void damage and 1d6 persistent void damage. Effects that use vitality energy, such as the [[Spells/Heal|Heal]] spell, automatically end this persistent damage.\n* * *\n\n**Summer Alcove (cold)** Winter's bitter chill descends on the target.\n\n*   **Critical Success** The trap has no effect.\n*   **Success** The target takes 2d6+2 cold damage.\n*   **Failure** The target takes 4d6+4 cold damage.\n*   **Critical Failure** The target takes 4d6+4 cold damage and is [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]] for 1 hour.\n* * *\n\n**Autumn Alcove (poison)** Poisonous springtime pollen sprays at the target.\n\n*   **Critical Success** The trap has no effect.\n*   **Success** The target takes 2d6+2 poison damage.\n*   **Failure** The target takes 4d6+4 poison damage.\n*   **Critical Failure** The target takes 4d6+4 poison damage and is [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]].\n* * *\n\n**Winter Alcove (fire)** Heat greater than the hottest summer afternoon engulfs the target.\n\n*   **Critical Success** The trap has no effect.\n*   **Success** The target takes 2d6+2 fire damage.\n*   **Failure** The target takes 4d6+4 fire damage.\n*   **Critical Failure** The target takes 4d6+4 fire damage and is [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] for 1 hour."
