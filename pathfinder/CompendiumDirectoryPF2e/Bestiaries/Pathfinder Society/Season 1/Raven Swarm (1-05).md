A flock of ravens is known as an unkindness. Certainly the name lives up to its meaning when a swarm of ravens decides to work together. In most cases, a raven swarm like the one presented here won't attack larger foes, but when manipulated by supernatural forces or simple desperation born from hunger, an unkindness of ravens can be a surprisingly dangerous foe.
