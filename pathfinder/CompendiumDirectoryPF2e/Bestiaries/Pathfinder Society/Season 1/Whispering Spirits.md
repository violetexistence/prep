    desc: "`pf2:r` (auditory, divine, emotion, mental) **Trigger** Multiple creatures remain in area **C4** for more than 6 seconds.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The whispers become more insistent until each character in the room must attempt a `DC 18 Will check` save.\n\nOn a failure, a creature is [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]] for 1 round (or for 1d6+1 rounds on a critical failure). Both the audible whispers and the babbling of the confused are related to the haunting's origin.\n\n  \n\n| Owners | Whispers and Babbles |\n| --- | --- |\n| Archdevil worshippers | Desperate praise of Mephistopheles |\n| Soulbound dollmakers | Pleading \"don't make me go in the doll again\" |\n| Alchemical experimenters | Frantic claims of not wanting to live forever anymore |\n| Slavers | Begging to be allowed to be released in multiple languages |\n| Crime lords | Promising not to mess with the family again |\n| Misguided Pharasmins | Sighing desires to be put to rest |"
