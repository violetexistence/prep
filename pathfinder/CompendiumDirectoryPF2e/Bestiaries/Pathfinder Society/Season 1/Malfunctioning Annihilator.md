Jamming the guns or tail require first getting on top of the immobilized annihilator, which counts as difficult terrain. All attempts take 2 actions."

    desc: "action (fire) The scorpion-like tail of the annihilator projects a 80-foot line of burning plasma.\n\nCreatures in the area take 6d6 fire damage (`DC 26 Reflex check`). The annihilator can't use the plasma lance again for 1d4 rounds."

  - name: "Routine"
    desc: "(2 actions) When the plasma lance is ready, the annihilator uses it to attack as many PCs as it can, otherwise it attacks with its two integrated chain guns while the plasma lance recharges, spending one action for each chain gun that is still functional. This trap doesn't take a multiple attack penalty. If Synthetic Khismar is destroyed, the annihilator attacks as many creatures as possible."
