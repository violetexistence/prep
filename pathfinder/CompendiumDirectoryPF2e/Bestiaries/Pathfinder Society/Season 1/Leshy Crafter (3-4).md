    desc: "`pf2:r`  **Trigger** The leshy crafter would take damage.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The leshy crafter uses his mystical link to the Abyssal shard to redirect the damage to a willing leshy of lower level within 30 feet. If this leshy is reduced to 0 HP as a result of the damage, the leshy crafter takes any remaining damage."

    desc: "`pf2:2`  The leshy crafter calls spiky roots that shoot up from the ground in the shape of Abyssal claws before retracting an instant later. This ability targets three 5-foot bursts within 30 feet. Each creature on the ground in an affected area takes 2d10 piercing damage (`DC 22 Reflex check` save). A creature takes the same amount of damage no matter how many overlapping bursts it's caught in."

    desc: "`pf2:2`  **Frequency** once per minute\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The leshy crafter calls forth materials and natural energies from the surrounding area, creating a brief vortex of flora and debris. Each non-plant creature within 10 feet of the leshy crafter takes 3d6 piercing damage and 3d6 void damage, with a `DC 22 Fortitude check` save.\n\nThe debris cloud lasts until the leshy crafter's next turn; while the cloud lasts, all creatures within it become [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]], and all creatures outside the cloud become concealed to creatures within it."
