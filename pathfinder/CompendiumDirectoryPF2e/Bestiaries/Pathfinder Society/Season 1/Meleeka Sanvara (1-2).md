    desc: "`pf2:2`  **Requirements** Meleeka is in Mastered Rain of Embers Stance\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Meleeka Strides twice. If she ends her movement within melee reach of at least one enemy, she can make a fire talon Strike against that enemy that deals an additional 1d4 fire damage. If she hits the target enemy, she can immediately [[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Grab|Grab]] them as a free action."

    desc: "`pf2:2`  **Requirements** Meleeka is in Mastered Rain of Embers Stance and has a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Meleeka lifts the creature high into the air and then slams it downward, causing a fiery explosion on impact. Meleeka attempts an `Athletics check` check against the creature's Fortitude DC. She takes a -2 circumstance penalty to her check if the target is one size larger than her and a -4 circumstance penalty if it's larger than that. She gains a +2 circumstance bonus to her check if the target is one size smaller than her and a +4 circumstance bonus if it's smaller than that.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** As success, but the creature also takes 1 persistent fire damage.\n\n**Success** The creature takes 1d4 bludgeoning damage plus 1d4 fire damage and falls and lands [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] in an unoccupied square adjacent to her (Meleeka's choice).\n\nUpon landing, the creature is no longer grabbed.\n\n**Failure** The creature is no longer grabbed.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but Meleeka falls prone."

  - name: "Mastered Rain of Embers Stance"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (stance) **Requirements** Meleeka is unarmored\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Meleeka enters the stance of an enraged phoenix, channeling her pain into resolve and holding her fingers as rigid as deadly talons while moving with quick, flickering gestures that resemble dancing flames. Meleeka gains a +1 status bonus to AC and saving throws and fire resistance 2, though if her current Hit Points are not equal to her maximum number of Hit Points, this status bonus increases to +3 and the fire resistance to 3. The only Strikes Meleeka can make are fire talon Strikes.\n\nThese deal 1d4 fire damage; are in the brawling group; and have the agile, finesse, nonlethal, and unarmed traits."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Grab|Grab]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** The monster's last action was a successful Strike that lists Grab in its damage entry, or the monster has a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]\n* * *\n\n**Effect** If used after a Strike, the monster attempts to [[Actions/grapple|grapple]] the creature using the body part it attacked with. This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."
