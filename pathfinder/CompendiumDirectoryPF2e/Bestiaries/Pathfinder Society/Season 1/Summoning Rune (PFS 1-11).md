The squares above the yellow runes summon a [[Bestiary 1/Fire Mephit|Fire Mephit]], while the squares above the blue runes summon an [[Monster Core/Imp|Imp]]. The creature rolls initiative and remains for 2d6 rounds, after which the spell ends and the creature disappears. The creature also disappears if someone disables the trap before the duration expires. The summoned creature can use 3 actions each round and can use reactions, unlike most summoned creatures."
