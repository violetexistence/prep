    desc: "`pf2:0` **Trigger** An adjacent creature attempts to play the organ\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The performer makes a `DC 21 Performance check` check.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** As success, and all other creatures who attempt to perform on the dead organ suffer a -1 status penalty to Play a Tune for 1 round.\n\n**Success** Creatures within 100 feet of the organ are subjected to one of the following effects, as chosen by the performer:\n\n*   **Bolster** (auditory, necromancy): Mindless undead within range gain a +1 status bonus to attack and damage rolls for 1 round.\n*   **Dance** (auditory, move, necromancy): Mindless undead within range Stride up to 15 feet in the same cardinal direction. All targets move the same distance. If impeded, they move as far as possible, then stop.\n*   **Discordant Blast** (auditory, evocation, sonic): All living creatures within 10 feet of the organ except the performer suffer 2d8+9 sonic damage (`DC 24 Fortitude check` save). On a failure or critical failure, a creature is also pushed 15 feet away from the organ.\n*   Swing (attack, auditory, flourish, necromancy): Mindless undead within range make a Strike in the same relative cardinal direction. This Strike doesn't count toward the undead creatures' multiple attack penalty, and their multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike.\n*   Weaken (auditory, necromancy): Mindless undead within range suffer a -1 status penalty to attack and damage rolls for 1 round.\n\n**Critical Failure** The player alone experiences the effects of a discordant blast."
