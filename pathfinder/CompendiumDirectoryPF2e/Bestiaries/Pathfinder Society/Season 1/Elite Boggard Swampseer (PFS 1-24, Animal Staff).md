Though this doesn't deal any damage to the boggard, it prevents it from using its tongue Strike until it regrows its tongue, which takes a week."

The boggard swampseer has been gifted with magic through its worship of the demon lord Gogunta, and uses its power to rule a boggard village, keeping the rest of the village in line and planning raids on nearby communities.

* * *

Boggards are aggressive humanoid amphibians that thrive in swamps, marshes, and even some rain forests. Boggards hatch from eggs into tadpoles, fiercely competing for food and even consuming their siblings in that struggle. Over 3 years, the surviving boggards develops arms, legs, and lungs while learning the rudiments of hunting, crafts, and warfare-everything needed to survive in their might-makes-right society. At the top of most boggard hierarchies lords a hulking swampseer imbued with sinister divine magic.
