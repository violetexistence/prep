    desc: "  When a barbed bloodseeker hits a target larger than itself, its barbed legs attach it to that creature. This is similar to [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbing]] the creature, but the bloodseeker moves with that creature rather than holding it in place.\n\nThe bloodseeker is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] while attached. If the bloodseeker is killed or pushed away while attached to a creature it has drained blood from, that creature takes 1 bleed damage. Escaping the attach or removing the bloodseeker in other ways doesn't cause bleed damage."

  - name: "Blood Drain"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** The bloodseeker is attached to a creature.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The bloodseeker uses its proboscis to drain blood from the creature it's attached to. This deals 1d6 damage, and the bloodseeker gains temporary Hit Points equal to the damage dealt. A creature that has its blood drained by a bloodseeker is [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]] until it receives healing (of any kind or amount)."
