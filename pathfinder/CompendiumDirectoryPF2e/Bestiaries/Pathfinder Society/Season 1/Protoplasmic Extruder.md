    desc: "(1 action) On its initiative, the trap creates an ooze in an adjacent unoccupied space. The first time the _protoplasmic extruder_ uses this action, it creates a [[Bestiary 1/Gelatinous Cube|Gelatinous Cube]] that acts immediately and thereafter acts on the _protoplasmic extruder's_ initiative. In following rounds, the _protoplasmic extruder_ instead creates [[Monster Core/Sewer Ooze|Sewer Oozes]] that act in the same manner.\n\nOozes created by the protoplasmic extruder are a nacreous green color; a gelatinous cube loses its transparent ability. All oozes created by the _protoplasmic extruder_ are loyal to the Ohrlavis and act as they command.\n\nThe _protoplasmic extruder_ can create no more than four oozes in total before it deactivates and resets."
  - name: "Reset"
    desc: "The _protoplasmic extruder_ must gather reagents from the arcane slurry of the sewers for 24 hours before it can be reactivated."
