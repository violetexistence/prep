    desc: "`pf2:r` **Trigger** Vengeant Thorn releases the rope when the wagon is 10 feet away from the target zone\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The tree drops 10 feet in front of the wagon, blocking the road. The tree deals 3d12 bludgeoning damage to anyone beneath the tree when it drops and [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilizes]] them. A creature that succeeds at a `DC 20 Reflex check` save takes half damage and is not immobilized, instead rolling out of the way in a random direction. On a critical success, it can choose the direction. Mounted creatures do not attempt a save unless their mount attempts a save and fails. If a mounted creature's mount fails the save, the mounted creature can attempt its own `DC 18 Reflex check` save by leaping off its mount, taking 1d4 bludgeoning damage from the fall. This damage is taken whether the save is successful or not."
