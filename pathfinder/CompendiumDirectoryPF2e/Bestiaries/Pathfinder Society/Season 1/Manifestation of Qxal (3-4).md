  - name: "Bloodsoaked Soil (Regeneration 20)"
    desc: "  Generations of Bhopanese bloodshed have soaked Bhopan's soil, giving the Thorned Monarch a vast reservoir of energy to sustain their manifestation. As long as the manifestation is touching the soil of Bhopan, it has regeneration 20.\n* * *\n\nThis monster regains the listed number of Hit Points each round at the beginning of its turn. Its [[Conditions/Dying|Dying]] condition never increases beyond Dying 3 as long as its regeneration is active. However, if it takes damage of a type listed in the regeneration entry, its regeneration deactivates until the end of its next turn. Deactivate the regeneration before applying any damage of a listed type, since that damage might kill the monster by bringing it to Dying 4."

The condition lasts for 1 hour. Each time a creature fails this save, Qxal can choose an additional condition.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the condition value is 2 ([[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 2]], [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 2]], or [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 2]])."
