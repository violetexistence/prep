    desc: "`pf2:r` **Trigger** A creature walks on the net.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The triggering creature falls into a spiked pit and submerges, with the net collapsing to entangle the creature. Spikes in the pit deal 2d6 piercing damage. The net imposes a -10-foot penalty to the creature's speed. A creature must succeed at two DC 15 checks to Escape from the net; a critical success to Escape frees them immediately. A creature that can't breathe underwater may begin drowning. Any round the creature struggles to escape the net, the creature uses 2 rounds of air."
