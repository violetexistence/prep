    desc: "A cadre of evil spirits assails people's minds throughout the stretch of forest. The spirits first afflict their hosts with visceral images of their own deaths, then try to recreate their deaths by forcing their hosts to inflict similar wounds upon themselves. Creatures frightened by the haunt appear to have ephemeral masks with horns, tusks, and yellow eyes over their faces."

    desc: "Two `DC 23 Occultism check` or `DC 23 Religion check` (trained) to exorcise the spirits. A creature can either inflict 4 mental damage to the haunt or permanently lower the DC of checks to exorcise the spirits 1 by succeeding at a `DC 20 Diplomacy check` check to calm the spirits, a `DC 20 Nature check` check to use kami-specific warding incantations, a `DC 20 Occultism check` check to leverage obscure haunt lore, or a `DC 20 Religion check` check to use a lesser exorcism. Any creature currently frightened by the haunt is a potential target for inflicting damage to the haunt; mental and vitality damage only affect such a host creature if they choose to be affected, while force or similar damage harms both the haunt and the host equally."

  - name: "Void Healing"
    desc: "passive A creature with void healing draws health from void energy rather than vitality energy. It is damaged by vitality damage and is not healed by vitality healing effects. It does not take void damage, and it is healed by void effects that heal undead."

    desc: "(3 actions) On its initiative, the haunt uses its first two actions to attempt to terrify a random target in its area that is not already [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened]]. The target must attempt a `DC 20 Will check` save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected and is temporarily immune to this haunt for 24 hours.\n\n**Success** The target is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]].\n\n**Failure** The target is frightened 1. The value of the frightened condition does not automatically decrease by 1 at the end of each of the target's turns. Instead, the target can attempt a `DC 18 Will check` save at the end of each of their turns to remove the condition.\n\n**Critical Failure** The target is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]]. The value of the frightened condition does not automatically decrease by 1 at the end of each of the target's turns. Instead, the target can attempt a `DC 18 Will check` save at the end of each of their turns to lower their frightened value by 1.\n* * *\n\nThe haunt then spends an action to compels one of the creatures that it has frightened to harm itself with surrounding forest debris, its strength fueled by spirit possession. The creature must succeed at a `DC 20 Will check` save or attempt to Strike itself during its turn as its first action, using the haunt's statistics below. Note that frightened applies equally to the creature's attack roll and AC, and therefore does not affect the accuracy of the attack."
