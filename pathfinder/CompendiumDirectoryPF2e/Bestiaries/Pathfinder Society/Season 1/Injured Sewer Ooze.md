Each creature in the area must succeed at a `DC 15 Reflex check` save or take 1d4 acid damage and take a -10-foot penalty to its Speeds for 1 minute (on a critical failure, the creature also falls [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]). A creature can spend and Interact action to clean someone off, decreasing the Speed penalty by 5 feet with each action."

These amorphous masses of sewage and other detritus make their way through filthy culverts beneath cities large and small.

Slimes, molds, and other oozes can be found in dank dungeons and shadowed forests. While not necessarily evil, some grow to enormous sizes and have insatiable appetites.
