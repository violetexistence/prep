    desc: " (aura) 30 feet. Paravaax's body exudes a powerful, fluctuating magnetic field that makes any opponent wearing or primarily comprised of metal [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 2]] for as long as they are within the aura and for 1 round thereafter. In addition, attacks targeting Paravaax made with metal weapons, or weapons whose primary striking surface is metal such as most arrows and bolts, suffer a -2 status penalty. Creatures exposed to this aura for several weeks (such as the elementals comprising Paravaax's \"court\") eventually become immune to this effect."
