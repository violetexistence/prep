Spikes in the pit deal 2d10 piercing damage. The net imposes a -10-foot penalty to the creature's speed. A creature must succeed at two DC 18 checks to Escape from the net a critical success to Escape frees them immediately. A creature that can't breathe underwater may begin drowning. Any round the creature struggles to escape the net, the creature uses 2 rounds of air."
