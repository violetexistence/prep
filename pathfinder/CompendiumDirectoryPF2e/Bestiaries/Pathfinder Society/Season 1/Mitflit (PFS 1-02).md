Mitflits, also known as mites, are self-loathing and pitiful cowards, easily bullied into servitude by other creatures or even slightly more powerful mitflit leaders. They tame insects, spiders, and other such creatures to serve as faithful allies. Mitflits have lost most of their ancestral gremlin magic, leaving these incomplete beings full of doubt and insecurity. Mitflits find companionship in the other base creatures of the world, and forge bonds of friendship with vermin, the only other beings that seem willing to accept them. A social structure, even one in which they are bullied, partially fills the hole within mitflits' personalities, and they rarely rebel or rail out unless their rage hits a breaking point.

Gremlins are cruel fey tricksters and saboteurs who have fully acclimated to life on the Material Plane, finding distinct niches for their inventive destructiveness. All gremlins delight in ruining or breaking things, whether it's something physical like a device or vehicle or something intangible such as an alliance or relationship. A gremlin's greatest joy is watching the collapse of complex creations, preferably after the lightest and slightest, carefully targeted push from the gremlin. Gremlins tend to denigrate, bully, or even slaughter their lesser kin, particularly mitflits, whom gremlins (and many others) derisively call "mites."
