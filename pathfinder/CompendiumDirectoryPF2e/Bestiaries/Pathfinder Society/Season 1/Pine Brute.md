    desc: "  A pine brute's bark secretes sticky sap. Any creature that hits the pine brute with a melee attack, is hit by the pine brute, or otherwise touches the pine brute must succeed at a `DC 17 Reflex check` save or suffer the effects of a lesser tanglefoot bag, also becoming [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] until the sticky substance is removed. A creature striking the pine brute with a weapon or object can automatically succeed at this Reflex save by leaving the object stuck to the pine brute. The object can then be removed with a successful `DC 17 Athletics check` check (made as a single action).\n\nA pine brute can have any number of objects stuck to it at a time. The pine brute can release a stuck object by using a single action, and the sap dissolves 1 minute after the pine brute dies, releasing all stuck objects.\n\n[[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Glue Bomb|Effect: Tanglefoot Bag (Lesser)]]"
