    desc: "`pf2:r` **Trigger** A creature enters the sensor area or fails any check to disable the phoenix rune.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** A white-hot talon of flame bursts upward from the phoenix rune, dealing 3d6 fire damage to a creature within the sensor area. This gout of fire is accompanied by the screech of a phoenix audible up to 500 feet away. Creatures within a 20-foot radius of the sensor area (including the triggering creature) must succeed at a `DC 16 Fortitude check` save or be [[Conditions/Deafened|Deafened]] for 1 round."


  - name: "Reset"
    desc: "Like its namesake creature, a phoenix rune is difficult to destroy. After it is triggered, a phoenix rune can immediately reset on a wall or floor within 120 feet, as long as it has not been disabled. When this happens, a PC who succeeds at a `DC 16 Perception check` check spots the shadowy form of a tiny phoenix \"flying\" along the wall or floor from the rune's old location to its new location."
