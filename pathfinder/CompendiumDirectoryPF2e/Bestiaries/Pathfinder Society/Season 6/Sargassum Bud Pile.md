    desc: "`pf2:r` **Trigger** a creature moves into a square adjacent to the bud pile or into the square the bud pile occupies\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The sargassum bud pile whips out numerous tendrils, attempting to grab the creature. The target must attempt a `DC 28 Reflex check` save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target dodges the tendril and is unaffected.\n\n**Success** A couple of tendrils latch on to the target. The target becomes [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]]. The target can [[Actions/Escape|Escape]] by attempting an Athletics or Acrobatics skill check of DC 28.\n\n**Failure** Several tendrils grab the target. The target becomes grabbed and must make a `DC 30 Fortitude check` or fall [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]. If the target cannot breathe in water, they begin to suffocate. The DC to Escape increases to 30.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, except the DC to Escape increases to 35."
