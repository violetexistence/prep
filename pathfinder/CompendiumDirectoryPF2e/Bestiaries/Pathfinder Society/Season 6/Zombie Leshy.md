    desc: " (healing,void) When a zombie leshy dies, a burst of twisted primal void energy explodes from its body, restoring 1d4 Hit Points to each undead fungi or plant creature in a 30-foot emanation and killing all natural plants, though merely causing discomfort to creatures with the plant trait. This area is filled with rotten vegetation, becoming difficult terrain."

  - name: "Glide"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (move) The zombie leshy glides gently through the air, moving 5 feet toward the ground and up to 25 feet forward. As long as the leshy spends at least 1 action gliding each round, it remains in the air at the end of each turn. For the purpose of determining damage from falls, a leaf leshy always treats falls as if they were 20 feet shorter."

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

Variant plague zombie

Plague zombies are infested with horrible contagions.

A zombie's only desire is to consume the living. Unthinking and ever-shambling harbingers of death, zombies stop only when they're destroyed.
