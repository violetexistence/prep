    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** Minister Jo has expensive bolts\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Minister Jo supplements his mediocre fighting ability with a variety of cheaply sourced magical items. He Reloads his sukgung with an expensive bolt and activates its magic, imbuing his next sukgung Strike with one of the following effects.\n\n*   **Shuffling Bolt** (teleportation) If the bolt hits a target, the target and Minister Jo swap places. If the triggering hit was a critical success, the target is [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] for 1 round after the teleportation.\n*   **Snare Bolt** If the bolt hits a target, silk webbing wraps around them, imposing a â€“10-foot circumstance penalty to their Speeds for 2d4 rounds, or until they [[Actions/escape dc=25|escape dc=25]] against a DC of 25. On a critical hit, the target is also [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] until it Escapes.\n*   **Spark Bolt** (electricity) The bolt deals an additional 2d12 electricity damage."
