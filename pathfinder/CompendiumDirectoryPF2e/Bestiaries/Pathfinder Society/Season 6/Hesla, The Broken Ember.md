If she still takes damage, she can attempt to redirect some of that energy back to the creature who damaged her by making a melee Strike with _Riftcarver_ against a DC equal to the attack roll that hit her, even at range. If she succeeds, the target creature takes 12 spirit damage (double on a critical success, 24 spirit)."

If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, the monster disrupts that action. This Strike doesn't count toward the monster's multiple attack penalty, and its multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike."
