  - name: "Gripping Aura"
    desc: " (aura,mental,unholy) 15 feet.\n\nA getidline subtly influences all living creatures within its aura to focus their attentions on holding to things they care about above all other concerns. When a living, non-demon creature starts its turn in the getidline's aura, it must attempt a `DC 21 Will check` save. On a failure, the targeted is [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]] as it focuses on maintaining its grip on its weapons and gear ([[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 2]] on a critical failure). The elementals are immune to this aura as they don't have possessions."

  - name: "Rip Away"
    desc: "`pf2:2`  The getidline rushes forward and rips a creature away from its standing. It Strides, then [[Actions/Grapple|Grapples]] a creature. If it successfully Grapples, it then [[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Constrict|Constricts]] the creature."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Improved Grab|Improved Grab]]"
    desc: "  **Requirements** The monster's last action was a successful Strike that lists Improved Grab in its damage entry, or the monster has a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]\n* * *\n\n**Effect** If used after a Strike, the monster attempts to [[Actions/grapple|grapple]] the creature using the body part it attacked with as a free action. This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead spend an action to use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."
