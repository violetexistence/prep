These count as one attack for the poltergeist's multiple attack penalty, and the penalty doesn't increase until after all the attacks.\n*   When this effect has only one target, the poltergeist makes a telekinetic object Strike against the target, and the damage increases to 3d12. It deals 1d12 untyped damage on a failure, and no damage on a critical failure."

Variant poltergeist

When a creature dies, and for whatever reason its spirit is unable or unwilling to leave the site of its death, that spirit may manifest as a poltergeist: a restless, invisible spirit that is still able to manipulate physical objects. Many poltergeists perished in a way that resulted from or led to extreme emotional trauma.
