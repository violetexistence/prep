Variant Bodyguard

Hired to protect someone famous or powerful, bodyguards use intimidation, quick wits, and martial skill to keep their charges safe. Such mercenaries might be auxiliaries to a noble's personal guards, but with special directives to safeguard their patrons.

* * *

Whether they're hired to wage war, protect a caravan, or infiltrate an impenetrable fortress, there's ample work for mercenaries all over Golarion.
