The capricious and destructive metal scamps are self-appointed forces of entropy, taking great pleasure in indiscriminately wrecking everything around them, sometimes even to their own detriment. Metal scamps have a severe appearance, with pointed facial features and angular limbs, and their skin can be the color of any metal, often heavily oxidized as if by years of exposure to the elements.
