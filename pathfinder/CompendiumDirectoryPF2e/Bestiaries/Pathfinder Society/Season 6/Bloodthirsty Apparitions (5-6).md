    desc: "`pf2:r` (occult) **Trigger** A living creature comes within 30 feet of the haunt\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The haunt wails, cursing the living for allowing the Puddles residents to wallow in misery while Absalom's elites prosper. Each living creature within 90 feet must attempt a `DC 21 Will check` save. The haunt then rolls initiative.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is temporarily immune to this bloodthirsty apparition's routine for 1 minute.\n\n**Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Failure** The creature shares the apparition's uncontrolled rage against the living. It makes a Strike against itself and becomes [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] for 1 minute.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature becomes [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 2]]."
