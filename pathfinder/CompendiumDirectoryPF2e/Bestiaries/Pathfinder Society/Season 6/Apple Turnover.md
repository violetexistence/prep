    desc: "`pf2:r` **Trigger** A PC passes by the cart without succeeding on the Perception check against its Stealth DC\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The cart tips, causing an avalanche of apples that pour over the PCs and onto the street. PCs who failed the Perception check against the hazard's Stealth DC are caught in the hazard must make their choice of a Reflex or Fortitude save, DC 19. On a successful save, they dodge the worst of the applefall and come away unscathed; on a failed save, they're battered by the falling apples and walk away [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] for the rest of the adventure.\n\nTriggering this hazard also accrues 1 AP for the party."
