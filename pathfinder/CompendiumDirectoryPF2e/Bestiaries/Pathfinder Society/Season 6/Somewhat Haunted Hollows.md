    desc: "(two actions) The Haunted Hollows haunt uses table flip or chair toss Strikes at different creatures in the area, favoring those who are trying to disable the haunt first, but otherwise choosing randomly. The table flip Strikes originate with any table in the room, destroying the table in the process. The chair toss Strikes originate with any chair or bar stool in the room, destroying that object in the process. If the haunt is not disabled, these objects reform and return to their original positions at dawn of the next day."
