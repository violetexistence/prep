    desc: " (aura,emotion,mental) 30 feet. As captain of the Pure Legion, Nanaeil bolsters the lower-level legionnaires under his command, granting them a +1 status bonus to their attack rolls and +2 status bonus to their will saves."

  - name: "Dual-Weapon Warrior"
    desc: "  Pitros Nanaeil is highly trained in the art of wielding two weapons at once, preferring to wield the _+1 striking scimitar_ in his main hand and the _bloodletting kukri_ in his off-hand."

    desc: "`pf2:r`  **Trigger** An enemy damages the monster's ally, and both are within 15 feet of the monster.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The ally gains resistance to all damage against the triggering damage equal to 2 + the monster's level. If the foe is within reach, the monster makes a melee Strike against it."

  - name: "Twin Riposte"
    desc: "`pf2:r`  **Trigger** A creature within your reach critically fails to Strike you.\n* * *\n\nA clever parry with one weapon leaves your opponent open to an attack with the other weapon. Make a melee Strike or [[Actions/Disarm|Disarm]] action against the triggering opponent."

  - name: "Double Slice"
    desc: "`pf2:2`  Nanaeil lashes out at his foe with both weapons. He makes two Strikes, one with each melee weapon, each using his current multiple attack penalty. Both Strikes must have the same target. If both attacks hit, combine their damage, then add any other applicable effects from both weapons. Precision damage is added only once. Combine the damage from both Strikes and apply resistances and weaknesses only once. This counts as two attacks when calculating his multiple attack penalty."

  - name: "Smite Divine"
    desc: "  The Pure Legion's scimitars have been enchanted specifically to take down divine spellcasters. Melee Strikes against clerics, champions, and other creatures capable of casting divine spells do an additional 2d6 mental damage."
