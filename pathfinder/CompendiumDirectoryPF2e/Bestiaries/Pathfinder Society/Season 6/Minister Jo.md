If the triggering hit was a critical success, the target is [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] for 1 round after the teleportation.\n*   **Snare Bolt** If the bolt hits a target, silk webbing wraps around them, imposing a â€“10-foot circumstance penalty to their Speeds for 2d4 rounds, or until they [[Actions/escape dc=21|escape dc=21]] against a DC of 21. On a critical hit, the target is also [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] until it Escapes.\n*   **Spark Bolt** (electricity) The bolt deals an additional 1d12 electricity damage."
