Variant grizzly bear

This large and powerful omnivore inhabits forested hills. While it typically sustains itself on nuts, berries, fish, and small mammals, it's fiercely territorial and will chase off or kill any creature it views as competition. Grizzly bears are especially temperamental when their young are nearby. In combat, a grizzly bear often attempts to grab and maul its foe with surprising ferocity. It continues its assault until its foe seems like it is no longer a threat, though if the bear is hungry, it will not hesitate to feed.

* * *

Bears are ferocious predators typically found in cold or temperate woodlands and hills. Many species of bear exist in addition to the two presented below, such as the smaller black bear or the arctic-dwelling polar bear.
