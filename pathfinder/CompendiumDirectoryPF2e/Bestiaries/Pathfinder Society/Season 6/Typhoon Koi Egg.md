    desc: "`DC 30 Arcana check`, `DC 30 Religion check`, `DC 30 Nature check`, or `DC 30 Occultism check` to purify the magic corrupting the ascension ritual, or `DC 33 Diplomacy check` or `DC 33 Performance check` to soothe the spirit within the koi egg and give it the strength to fight off the corruption itself; four total successes are required to purify the ritual, each of the first three successes purifying one ring of water and the final one halting the ritual itself. If the cursed comb has not been removed from the ritual site, then succeeding on this final check merely halts the ritual; if the cursed comb has been removed from the ritual site, then succeeding on this final check completes the ascension ritual."

    desc: "`pf2:r` **Trigger** Xalreonshin rolls initiative, three rounds pass after the PCs begin speaking with Xalreonshin, or a creature other than Xalreonshin comes within 40 feet of the egg\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The turbulent koi egg churns the lake surface, ejecting water into the sky. A 1-mile-radius area centered on the egg becomes filled with heavy rain and strong wind imposing a -2 circumstance penalty to Perception checks and requiring flying creatures to [[Actions/maneuver-in-flight dc=24|maneuver-in-flight dc=24]]."

  - name: "Routine"
    desc: "(1 action) Torrential water descends from the sky, taking the shape of a dragon that smashes into one creature within 60 feet of the egg. The dragon always targets the creature that is closest to the egg, dealing 2d12+2 bludgeoning damage and 2d12 fire damage in a spray of boiling water (`DC 28 Fortitude check` save). Creatures that fail the save are pushed 10 feet away. Creatures that have the earth trait, are carrying an item with the earth trait, or are otherwise strongly tied to elemental earth (such as an earth elemental sorcerer or kineticist) get the result one degree of success better than the outcome of their save, as the power of elemental earth overcomes water."
  - name: "Reset"
    desc: "The turbulent koi egg can attempt to hatch again, restarting the ascension ritual, after 1000 years of Xalreonshin's care."
