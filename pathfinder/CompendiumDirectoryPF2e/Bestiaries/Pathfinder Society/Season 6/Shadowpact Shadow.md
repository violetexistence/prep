This shadow spawn is incurably [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 2]].

This is cumulative with other enfeebled conditions from shadows, to a maximum of [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 4]]. If this increases a creature's enfeebled value to 3 or more, the target's shadow is separated from its body (see shadow spawn). The enfeebled value from [[Actions/Steal|Steal]] Shadow decreases by 1 every hour."
