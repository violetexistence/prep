    desc: "  The goliath spider has imprecise tremorsense to detect the vibrations of creatures touching its web.\n* * *\n\nTremorsense allows a monster to feel the vibrations through a solid surface caused by movement. It is an imprecise sense with a limited range (listed in the ability). Tremorsense functions only if the monster is on the same surface as the subject, and only if the subject is moving along (or burrowing through) the surface."

  - name: "Hazard Immunity"
    desc: "  The shadowpact goliath spider never triggers the reactions of hazards in its own lair and is immune to the negative consequences of damaging area effects created by hazards in its lair (so if a PC set off a hazard that released a [[Spells/Fireball|Fireball]] inside its lair, it would not take damage from the _fireball_ even if it was within the _fireball's_ area)."

  - name: "Web Tether"
    desc: "  A creature hit by the spider's web Strike is [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]] and tethered to the spider, preventing it from moving farther away from the spider.\n\nThe spider can have one creature tethered at a time. The DC to [[Actions/Escape|Escape]] or [[Actions/Force Open|Force Open]] the web is 30. The tether can be severed with a Strike (AC 20, Hardness 5, HP 20), but this doesn't free the restrained creature."

Variant goliath spider

Goliath spiders dwell in the deepest jungles, where they build webs as big as temples and feast on prey as large as hippopotami.

Few everyday vermin inspire as much dread as the infamous spider.
