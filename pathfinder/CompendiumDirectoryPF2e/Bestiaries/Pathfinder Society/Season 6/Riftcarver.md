  - name: "Description"
    desc: "_Riftcarver_ is the chthonic artifact weapon of Deskari, the slain demon lord of the locust host and plague of the Worldwound (now known as the Sarkoris Scar). Unfettered from its creator, it now wreaks havoc on the enemies of its current master, Hesla Embersplitter."

    desc: "`DC 24 Deception check` (expert), `DC 24 Demon Lore check` (trained), or `DC 24 Religion check` (expert) to remind _Riftcarver_ that it should not serve an interloper; `DC 28 Intimidation check` (trained), `DC 28 Nature check` (trained), or `DC 28 Occultism check` (trained) to temporarily make _Riftcarver's_ spirit cower; [[Spells/Dispel Magic|Dispel Magic]] (5th rank, counteract DC 25); three total successes are required to disable the hazard. The first time _Riftcarver_ is taken away from Hesla Embersplitter against her will (via disarm, a spell, or some other method), it also counts as one success. If Hesla Embersplitter is rendered [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]] or killed, the hazard immediately ends."

    desc: "`pf2:r` **Trigger** An enemy of Hesla Embersplitter rolls for initiative\n* * *\n\n**Effect** _Riftcarver_ calls out with thousands of voices to infest the minds of the righteous. Any creature within 60 feet with the holy trait must succeed at a `DC 30 Will check` save or become [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] ([[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 3]] on a critical failure). _Riftcarver_ then rolls initiative."

  - name: "Carve Rift"
    desc: "action A line of acid slices through creatures and terrain alike, creating a rift that is 20 feet high, 100 feet long, and 1 inch thick. This rift provides cover. The rift deals 5d8 acid damage to each creature that is in its space when it is first created, that attempts to pass through it, or that ends its turn inside the rift, with a `DC 26 Reflex check` save. A creature that succeeds at this save when the chasm is created is pushed to the nearest space on the side of its choice. Creatures trying to move through the rift fail to do so if they critically fail their save, ending their movement next to the rift."

  - name: "Routine"
    desc: "(three actions) _Riftcarver_ lives up to its name, using all three of its actions to carve a new rift in a random direction (rolling 1d8 to determine that direction). Hesla Embersplitter is immune to the effects of these rifts while wielding _Riftcarver_."
