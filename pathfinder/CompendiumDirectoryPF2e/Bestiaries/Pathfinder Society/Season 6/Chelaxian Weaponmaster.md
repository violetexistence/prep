    desc: "`pf2:r`  **Trigger** A creature within the monster's reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The monster attempts a melee Strike against the triggering creature.

The Chelaxian fighter attempts an `Intimidation check` check against the Will DC of one ally within 30 feet. On a success, the target's [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened]] condition is reduced by 2, and the Chelaxian fighter can attempt to counteract one mental effect that ally is suffering from with a +17 counteract modifier. On a critical success, the Chelaxian fighter also reduces the frightened condition of each other ally in a 10-foot emanation around the target by 1."

  - name: "Create Opening"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** The Chelaxian weaponmaster's last action was a Strike that hit an opponent\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The Chelaxian weaponmaster twists their blade and pushes with their shield to create an opening in the required opponent's defenses. That opponent takes a â€“2 status penalty to their AC against the next Strike made against them before the start of the Chelaxian weaponmaster's next turn. While this penalty lasts, the Chelaxian weaponmaster gains an additional reaction they can only use to make a Reactive Strike against the penalized opponent.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Create Opening|Effect: Create Opening]]"
