    desc: "`DC 12 Religion check` (trained) sets the spirits at ease, or `DC 15 Deception check`, `DC 15 Diplomacy check`, or `DC 15 Intimidation check` to convince the spirits to not interfere right now.

On a failure, the creature becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] ([[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 3]] on a critical failure). On a success, a creature is temporarily immune to gurgling gasp for 1 hour. The haunt cannot use gurgling gasp again for 1d6 rounds."
