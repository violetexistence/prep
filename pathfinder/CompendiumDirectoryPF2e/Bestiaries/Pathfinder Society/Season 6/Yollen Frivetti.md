    desc: "`pf2:2` (arcane,magical) Yollen's signature spellstrike channels the ill will of Hell. He casts [[Spells/Ignition|Ignition]], then makes a melee attack strike with his greataxe. If he successfully hits, he deals an additional 2d6 damage (4d6 on a critical hit) on top of the damage from _ignition_ and the greataxe. This counts as two attacks for the purposes of multiple attack penalty, but the penalty does not apply until after Yollen completes this ability. Yollen cannot use Hellish Spellstrike again until he has recharge it using a single action with the concentrate trait or cast his conflux spell."
