    desc: "`pf2:1` (auditory,curse,linguistic,occult) **Requirement** A grabbed, paralyzed, restrained, or unconscious creature is within Averill's reach\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Averill whispers into the creature's ears, compelling them to join him. The creature is unable to attack Averill Quint for the duration, unless Averill uses a hostile action against them, and any undead Pathfinder can treat the creature as an ally for purposes of flanking. The creature must attempt a `DC 18 Will check` save\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is temporarily immune for 1 minute.\n\n**Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Failure** The curse lasts 1 round.\n\n**Critical Failure** The curse lasts 2 rounds."

    desc: "`pf2:r`  **Trigger** A creature within the monster's reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The monster attempts a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, the monster disrupts that action. This Strike doesn't count toward the monster's multiple attack penalty, and its multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike."

    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** The monster's last action was a successful Strike that lists Grab in its damage entry, or the monster has a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]\n* * *\n\n**Effect** If used after a Strike, the monster attempts to [[Actions/grapple|grapple]] the creature using the body part it attacked with. This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."
