    desc: "This unsteady pile of furniture is piled to the top of this usually high-ceilinged room. There looks to be some space to squeeze through to the other side, but even the slightest touch causes the stack to destabilize, and there's so much that once it begins to fall, it's difficult to stop."

  - name: "Tumbling Down"
    desc: "`pf2:r` **Trigger** A creature moves into a space adjacent to the furniture pile\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Part of the pile slides into a space the creature occupies, causing 2d8+5 bludgeoning damage with a `DC 21 Reflex check` save. The furniture pile rolls initiative."

  - name: "Routine"
    desc: "On its initiative, the pile expands into an adjacent space, dealing creatures in that space 2d8+5 bludgeoning damage with a `DC 21 Reflex check` save, pushing them into an adjacent empty space, and making that space impassable until cleared. If no adjacent empty space is available, the pile buries the creature, suffocating it. Clearing a space or pulling a creature out requires a `DC 18 Athletics check` check."
