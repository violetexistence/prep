    desc: "  Once the Husk of Deskari has been reduced to 160 hp the surviving locusts retreat inside the Husk rather than surrounding it. At this point the Disgorge Swarm aura ceases to function, the Husk loses its weakness to splash effects and area of effect attacks, and any creature still taking persistent damage from this effect automatically succeeds on their next flat check to remove it."

    desc: " (auditory,aura,mental) The droning buzz of locusts fills the air and mingles with the rasping, screeching sounds of the Husk's carapace plates grinding as it moves. Any creature that begins its turn or moves within 60 feet of the Husk of Deskari must attempt a `DC 33 Fortitude check` save or be [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]]. After attempting the save a creature is immune to the effects of cacophony for 1 minute. On a critical failure, a creature is only immune for 1 round."

    desc: "`pf2:r`  **Trigger** A creature within the monster's reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The monster attempts a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, the monster disrupts that action. This Strike doesn't count toward the monster's multiple attack penalty, and its multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike."

  - name: "Disgorge Swarm"
    desc: "`pf2:2`  Millions of fiendish locusts swarm out of the Husk of Deskari, surrounding it in a 30-foot emanation. The emanation moves with the Husk and remains until removed by Locust Horde. Any creature that enters or begins its turn in the emanation must attempt a `DC 36 Reflex check` save, with effects based on the results of the save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature takes 2d8 piercing damage and is [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] for 1 round.\n\n**Failure** The creature takes 4d8 piercing damage and is clumsy 1 for 1 minute.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature takes 8d8 piercing damage and is [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 2]] for one minute."

  - name: "Swarmsense"
    desc: "  The Husk of Deskari can see through the eyes of each insect in the swarms infesting its body or those created by its breath weapon. This grants the Husk of Deskari All-Around Vision."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Knockdown|Knockdown]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** The monster's last action was a successful Strike that lists Knockdown in its damage entry\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The monster attempts to [[Actions/trip|trip]] the creature. This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the monster's multiple attack penalty."
