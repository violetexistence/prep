The creature must attempt a `DC 18 Reflex check` Save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is able to move to an adjacent square.\n\n**Success** The creature grabs an edge.\n\n**Failure** The creature falls into the pit and lands [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]].

    desc: "(3 actions) On its turn each round, two new 10-foot-square sinkholes, 10 feet deep, randomly appear on the map. Until a creature of size Small or larger steps in the area of one, it looks no different than the surrounding area. If a creature takes an action to seek and succeeds at a `DC 18 Perception check` check, it notices the hazardous square."
