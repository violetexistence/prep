He can make two Strikes with his burning blades, each against the same target and Najid's current multiple attack penalty. If both attacks hit, combine their damage for the purposes of weakness and resistance. Both strikes deal fire damage regardless of the usual damage type. This counts as two attacks when calculating Najid's multiple attack penalty. Najid's focus leaves his blades."
