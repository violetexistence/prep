Variant taunting skull

Some beheaded are raised with their mental faculties mostly intact. These clever undead often provoke their victims into foolishly giving chase or harming themselves.

* * *

Beheaded are disembodied floating heads transformed into undead. They are natural candidates for a necromancer's "project minion," due to the inexpensive cost of creation and endlessly customizable nature. In any lair occupied for long by practicing necromancers, it isn't uncommon to find a handful of floating heads roaming about, each exhibiting completely different characteristics and even degrees of expertise in their creation.
