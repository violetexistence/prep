  - name: "Lookout's Warning"
    desc: "action (auditory, emotion, mental) Singe lets out one of the following cries, in order (repeating from the top, if necessary). Everyone in the haunt's area must attempt a `DC 27 Will check` save. On a success, the creature is unaffected; on a critical success, it also gains a +2 circumstance bonus on its next save vs. Lookout's Warning. Other effects depend on the specific cry below.\n\n*   **Thar She Blows:** \"Captain, look! A huge whale! It's coming toward usâ€”fast!\" On a failure, the creature is [[Conditions/Fascinated|Fascinated]] for 1 round, looking for the whale; on a critical failure it's fascinated for 1 minute, and the condition doesn't end if Singe makes a Strike on an ally or uses Lookout's Warning.\n*   **No Quarter:** \"It's coming around again! It's relentless! Brace for impact!\" On a failure, the creature is tossed off balance; it is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] for 1 round. On a critical failure, it's also knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]].\n*   **Shark Bait:** \"Captain, it's hopeless! It's going to destroy the ship!\" On a failure, a sense of doom fills the creature, which becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]]. On a critical failure, the fear is overwhelming, and it becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] and [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]].\n*   **Going Down with the Ship:** \"Get below, captain, and secure the Forked Key! I'll try to give you time!\" On a failure, the creature must spend one action putting an item it is holding away; if it is not holding anything, it is [[Conditions/Fleeing|Fleeing]] for one action. On a critical failure, it must spend three actions in a combination of putting away any items it is holding and fleeing."

    desc: "`pf2:d` Singe uses its first action(s) to make a long gun Strike against a random creature in the area. It uses its final action for Lookout's Warning. If the PCs successfully use Pathfinder Society Lore to Disable the haunt, Singe loses an action to make a long gun Strike."
  - name: "Reset"
    desc: "The haunt deactivates 1 minute after all creatures leave the area but resets immediately thereafter."
