    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,manipulate,occult) The necromancer summons two Medium undead entities in different empty squares up to 30 feet away. These undead entities can take the form of zombies, skeletons, or ghosts, chosen by the necromancer. The entities block movement as though they were creatures and can be attacked. Each entity has 1 Hit Point and the same AC and saves as the necromancer. They can't take actions of their own and deteriorate if the necromancer is reduced to 0 Hit Points. The necromancer can have up to four undead entities at any given time. If they call another, the oldest undead entity deteriorates.\n\n[[Season 6/Screaming Grub Undead|Screaming Grub Undead]]"

Each entity can Stride up to 20 feet into an empty square and make a Strike. The Strike has a +15 attack modifier and deals 2d12 bludgeoning damage (or spirit damage if the entity is a spirit). The Strike has the magical trait, and no multiple attack penalty applies to it."
