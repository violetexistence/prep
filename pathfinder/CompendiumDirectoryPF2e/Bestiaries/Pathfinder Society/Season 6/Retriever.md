The retriever cannot use the same effect in consecutive rounds. Once the retriever has used all four options, the eye ray Strike can't be used for 1d4 rounds.\n\n*   **Cold** The enemy takes 2d12+13 cold damage\n*   **Electricity** The enemy takes 2d12+13 electricity damage\n*   **Fire** The enemy takes 2d12+13 fire damage\n*   **Petrification** The enemy is targeted by a 6th-rank [[Spells/Petrify|Petrify]] using the retriever's innate spell DC (`DC 26 Fortitude check`)."

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."
