Variant Halfling Street Watcher

Halflings' keen sight makes them excellent street watchers. Though the job rarely calls for fighting, most street watchers cover themselves head to ankle in whatever armor and weapons they manage to get their hands on.

Despite their small stature, a halfling can prove to be a mighty foe if you find yourself on the wrong side of their frying pan.
