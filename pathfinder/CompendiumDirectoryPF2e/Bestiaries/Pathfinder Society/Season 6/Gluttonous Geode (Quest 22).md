    desc: "  Tremorsense allows a monster to feel the vibrations through a solid surface caused by movement. It is an imprecise sense with a limited range (listed in the ability). Tremorsense functions only if the monster is on the same surface as the subject, and only if the subject is moving along (or burrowing through) the surface."

Doing so is like Grabbing the creature ([[Actions/Escape|Escape]] DC 17), but the geode moves with that creature rather than holding it in place. The geode is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] while attached. If the geode is killed or pushed away while attached to a creature, that creature takes 1 persistent bleed damage. Escaping the attached geode or removing the geode in other ways doesn't cause bleed damage."

The vast ranks of earth elementals have been slow to respond to the return of the elemental lords and the Planes of Metal and Wood. These events have not broken the mountains, nor have they blown away the sands.

## Earthy Emotions

Earth elementals talk even less than most elementals. They're ponderous, weighing decisions so slowly they can crush the energy from a discussion. Their foremost concern is whether a situation can be endured. Though a rare or resplendent treasure might entice an earth elemental, it's difficult to spur any sense of urgency in them without the presence of an immediate threat.
