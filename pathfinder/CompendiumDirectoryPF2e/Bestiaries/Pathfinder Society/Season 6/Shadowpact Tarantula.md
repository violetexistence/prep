    desc: "  The shadowpact tarantula never triggers the reactions of hazards in its own lair and is immune to the negative consequences of damaging area effects created by hazards in its lair (so if a PC set off a hazard that released a [[Spells/Fireball|Fireball]] inside its lair, it would not take damage from the _fireball_ even if it was within the _fireball's_ area)."
