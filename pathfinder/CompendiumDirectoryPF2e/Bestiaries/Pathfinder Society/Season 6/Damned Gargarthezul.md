  - name: "Mark of Avarice"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** The gargarthezul's last action was a successful tentacle Strike.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The gargarthezul places a brand on the creature it hit that fills the creature's mind with overwhelming urges towards piracy. The creature doesn't treat anyone as their ally and can't Delay or Ready. They must use all of their actions to attempt to Disarm, or Demoralize, targeting a creature randomly determined by the GM (they may use actions to facilitate their attempts, such as to move to the target or to drop an item so they have a free hand). The duration is based on a `DC 19 Will check` save. If the creature successfully Disarms or Demoralizes their target, they can attempt a `DC 11 Flat check` check to recover from Mark of Avarice. The gargarthezul may only have one mark of avarice in effect at any given time. An additional mark placed causes the previous one to fade.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature becomes temporarily immune for 1 minute.\n\n**Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Failure** The mark lasts for 1 round.\n\n**Critical Failure** The mark lasts for 1 minute.\n\n* * *\n"
