    desc: "  This monster regains the listed number of Hit Points each round at the beginning of its turn. Its [[Conditions/Dying|Dying]] condition never increases beyond Dying 3 as long as its regeneration is active. However, if it takes damage of a type listed in the regeneration entry, its regeneration deactivates until the end of its next turn. Deactivate the regeneration before applying any damage of a listed type, since that damage might kill the monster by bringing it to Dying 4."

  - name: "Hellish Spellstrike"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (arcane,magical) Yollen's signature spellstrike channels the ill will of Hell. He casts ignition, then makes a melee attack strike with his greataxe. If he successfully hits, he deals an additional 3d6 damage (6d6 on a critical hit) on top of the damage from ignition and the greataxe. This counts as two attacks for the purposes of multiple attack penalty, but the penalty does not apply until after Yollen completes this ability. Yollen cannot use Hellish Spellstrike again until he has recharge it using a single action with the concentrate trait, or cast his conflux spell."
