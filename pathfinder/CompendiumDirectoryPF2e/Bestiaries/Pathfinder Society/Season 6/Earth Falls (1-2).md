    desc: "(3 actions) On its turn each round, two new 10-foot-square sinkholes, 5 feet deep, randomly appear on the map. Until a creature of size Small or larger steps in the area of one, it looks no different than the surrounding area. If a creature takes an action to seek and succeeds at a `DC 15 Perception check` check, it notices the hazardous square."
