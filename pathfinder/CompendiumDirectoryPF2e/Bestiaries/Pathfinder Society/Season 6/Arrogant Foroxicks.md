Variant witchwarg

Wargs hunt in packs like wolves, but their penchant for taunting victims makes them easy to distinguish from their cousins. Orcs and hobgoblins frequently recruit wargs. Most wargs are amenable to this arrangement, but if food should run out, wargs are more than willing to integrate goblinoid flesh into their diet.

* * *

The warg is an intelligent and malevolent wolf that dwells among goblins, hobgoblins, orcs, and violent humanoids.
