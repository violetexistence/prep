    desc: "  The statue is magically powered by the same geothermal power that heats the waters in Maecho's hot springs. Dealing 15 cold damage to the statue cools it off, preventing it from using Boil Alive, removing the fire damage from its ranged attacks, and making it [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] for one round, after which the cold water cycles out of the statue and it returns to its usual temperature."

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

Variant Giant Animated Statue

Giant animated statues' increased size and power make them most useful in large vaults, spacious chambers, or outdoor locations. Tasks beyond their capabilities typically require a more advanced construct, not an animated object.

Granted a semblance of life through the use of rituals or other strange magic, animated objects take many forms and serve a variety of uses. A few examples of typical animated objects are listed below. Many of these creatures serve as guardians, surprising unsuspecting adventurers when they suddenly attack. Others serve as idle distractions for the exceptionally rich, simple servants created to handle odd jobs, and the like.
