    desc: "`pf2:1` (divine,unholy) Marius makes a quick hop through the Pit to reappear close to an enemy in a cloud of brimstone and ash. Marius teleports to any square within 15 feet that is within reach of another creature, then makes a melee Strike against one creature within his reach. This movement does not provoke reactions."

  - name: "Spellstrip Strike"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (arcane,concentrate) Marius specializes in using a spellcaster's own spells against them. He makes a melee attack against an enemy, dealing damage as normal. If the melee attack succeeds, he can use the [[Actions/Steal|Steal]] action to attempt to take one of the enemy's prepared spells or unused spontaneous spell slots. If successful, Marius gains a temporary spontaneous spell slot for the stolen spell until the end of his next turn. Determine the stolen spell at random from the target's spells that are 1st-rank. Innate spells, focus spells, and cantrips cannot be stolen in this manner."
