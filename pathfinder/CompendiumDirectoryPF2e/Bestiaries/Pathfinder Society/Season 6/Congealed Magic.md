    desc: "  Whenever a congealed magic would take slashing damage (if it weren't immune) and has at least 10 HP, it splits into two identical oozes with half the original's HP. One congealed magic is in the same space as the original, and the other appears in an adjacent unoccupied space. If no adjacent space is unoccupied, move smaller creatures and objects out of the way to make a space or the split is canceled at the GM's discretion."

variant string slime

Found underground or in dungeons, these quivering, slug-like ropes of slime continuously scour their domain for food. In addition to their shape, they are named for their ability to shoot out expanding ribbons of slime that resemble tangled strings.

* * *

Slimes, molds, and other oozes can be found in dank dungeons and shadowed forests. While not necessarily evil, some grow to enormous sizes and have insatiable appetites.
