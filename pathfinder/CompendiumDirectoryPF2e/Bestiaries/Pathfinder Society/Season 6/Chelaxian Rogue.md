    desc: "  The Chelaxian rogue is an expert at maintaining perfect stillness and blending into their surroundings. Each non-ally creature who has not been targeted by or subject to an attack or effect made by the Chelaxian rogue must, at the start of their turn, succeed at a `DC 26 Will check` save (`DC 27 Will check` in dungeon environments while the Chelaxian rogue is wearing their camouflage suit) or the Chelaxian rogue becomes [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] to them. This effect ends if the Chelaxian rogue moves without Sneaking or takes any hostile action against the non-ally creature. This does not prevent a creature from making Perception checks to [[Actions/Seek|Seek]], making the rogue Observed as normal on a success."
