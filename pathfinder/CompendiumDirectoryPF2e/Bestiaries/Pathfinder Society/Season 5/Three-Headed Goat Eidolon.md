    desc: "`pf2:r`  **Trigger** A creature within the monster's reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The monster attempts a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, the monster disrupts that action. This Strike doesn't count toward the monster's multiple attack penalty, and its multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike."

  - name: "Three Headed"
    desc: "  Any ability that would sever one of the three-headed goat's heads (such as a critical hit with a vorpal weapon) severs one head at random. Losing a head doesn't kill the three-headed goat (as long as it has one head left), but it does prevent it from making Strikes with the lost head or using the head's Breath Weapon."

  - name: "Triple Opportunity"
    desc: "  The three-headed goat eidolon gains 2 extra reactions each round that it can use only to make Attacks of Opportunity. It must use a different head for each reaction, and it can't use more than one on the same triggering action. If it loses one of its heads, it also loses one of these extra reactions."

  - name: "Three-Headed Strike"
    desc: "`pf2:2`  **Frequency** once per turn\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The three-headed goat makes a Strike with each of its heads, each at a â€“2 penalty and targeting a different creature. These Strikes count as two attacks for the three-headed goat's multiple attack penalty, and the penalty doesn't increase until after it has made all three attacks"
