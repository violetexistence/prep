    desc: "`pf2:2` (incapacitation,possession) Omertius sends himself into his target's blood, controlling them as if af ected by the spell [[Spells/Possession|Possession]]. The target attempts a `DC 28 Fortitude check` check. Omertius can Dismiss the spell at any time.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unafected.\n\n**Success** Omertius possesses the target but can't control it.\n\n**Failure** Omertius possesses the target and takes partial control. He no longer has a separate turn; instead, he might control the target. At the start of each of the target's turns, it attempts another Will save. If it fails, it's controlled by Omertius on that turn; if it succeeds, it chooses its own actions; and if it critically succeeds, it forces him out and the spell ends.\n\n**Critical Failure** Omertius possesses the target fully, and the target can only watch as he manipulates it like a puppet. The target is controlled by Omertius."

Variant invidiak

For most demons, possessing a creature requires a ritual, magic item, or condition, but for invidiaks, who lack a body, possession is akin to donning a suit of clothing. Known also as shadow demons, invidiaks are formed from envious mortal souls.
