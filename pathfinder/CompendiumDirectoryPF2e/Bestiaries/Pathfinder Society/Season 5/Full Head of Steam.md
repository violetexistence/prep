    desc: "(4 actions) Each of the four steam vents uses a single action each to emit superheated steam, which spreads for 60 feet along the wall from its location and extends out from the wall by 30 feet, dealing 2d12+13 untyped damage to each creature in their range (`DC 29 Fortitude check` save). For each disabled vent, the trap loses 1 action each turn."
