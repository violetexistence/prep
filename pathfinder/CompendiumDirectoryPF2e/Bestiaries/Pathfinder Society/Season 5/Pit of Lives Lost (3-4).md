Each living creature in those areas must attempt a `DC 21 Fortitude check` save as the flow of vile liquid saps their very essence. The pull is more intense on more powerful creatures, dealing 1d6 void damage per level the creature has.\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature takes half damage.\n\n**Failure** The creature takes full damage. Additionally, they are [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] and cannot reduce the condition's value for 1 minute.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage. Additionally, they are sickened 1 and cannot reduce the condition's value until they leave the Nether Cathedral."
