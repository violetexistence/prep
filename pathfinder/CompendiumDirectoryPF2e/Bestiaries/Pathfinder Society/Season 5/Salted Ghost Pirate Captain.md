If the creature fails its save, it remains conscious but is controlled by the ghost until it loses its dying condition. It continues to attempt recovery checks as normal for the dying condition. The effect ends if the creature loses the dying condition. If the creature dies while under this effect, it joins the ghost's undead crew in 1d4 days. If the ghost is destroyed before the creature dies, the creature is spared this terrible fate."

Variant ghost pirate captain

Undead prowling the ocean on derelict ships have long been threats sailors keep an eye out for. Other than corporeal undead, some undead pirates take on an incorporeal form, especially if their bodies have been lost to the fishes. Captains of crews in particular are likely to return from the dead, perhaps on account of their strong personalities.

Tethered to the world after death by powerful emotions that haven't been resolved, ghosts haunt the living as sad echoes of their former selves.
