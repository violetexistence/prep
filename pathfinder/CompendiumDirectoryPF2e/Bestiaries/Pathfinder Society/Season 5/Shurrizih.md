  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Change Shape|Change Shape]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (arcane,concentrate,polymorph) The jann transforms into a Small or Medium elemental or animal. This doesn't affect the gennayn's statistics, but it could change the damage type of their Strikes.\n* * *\n\nThe monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

Variant jann shuyookh

Regarded as the progenitors of geniekind, janns hold a position of esteem above the genies tied to specific planes. They possess an inborn ability to grant wishes, which the other branches of geniekind lack and greatly envy. Nomadic jann shuyookhs rarely hold court, preferring to gather only when the need arises to perform great deeds. Lesser janns respect and venerate these leaders for their wisdom and total dedication to preserving the honor and reputation of their people. A jann shuyookh reads portents and omens when dealing with duplicitous mortals.
