    desc: "  While aghashes hate all mortals, they particularly despise beautiful objects and beautiful or charismatic mortals. When not in physical peril, an aghash is compelled to destroy art and other works of beauty. An aghash can't enter an area of pristine beauty without first marring it in some way.\n\nGiven a choice, an aghash attacks a foe with the highest Charisma score first. If barred from doing so by force or some magical effect, they take 1d6 mental damage at the end of their turn."

    desc: "`pf2:3` (divine,earth) **Frequency** once per day\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The aghash creates a temporary sandstorm in a 30-foot emanation that lasts for 1 minute.\n\nCreatures within the emanation take a â€“4 circumstance penalty to Perception checks and must succeed at a `DC 15 Fortitude check` save. On a failure, they're forced to hold their breath or else they start suffocating. A creature within the sandstorm at the end of its turn takes 1d4 slashing damage.\n\nDivs are immune to all effects of an aghash's sandstorm.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Sandstorm|Effect: Sandstorm]]"
