Variant brimorak

These goat-headed demons have glowing red eyes and flaming hooves but measure only about 3 feet in height. Born from the souls of arsonists, the fiery brimoraks continue the work they pursued in life, as everything they touch quickly burns.

As a general rule, brimoraks are ill-tempered even for demons, although their spite turns to glee in the face of a growing fire. Those who have survived encounters with these fiends report that they remember the braying sound of the brimoraks' laughter as clearly as the heat of the flames or the choking scent of smoke.

Mortal souls that have been twisted and corrupted by sin sometimes arise in the afterlife as demons. These powerful and destructive fiends seek to spread their particular sin to warp more souls, thereby bolstering their numbers and continuing the cycle.
