    desc: "(two actions) A mushroom adjacent to one or more creatures uses Poison Spores. If there are no adjacent creatures, the mushroom vanishes in the ground and reappears in another square, making a Sprout attack. If no conscious creatures are within 20 feet of the center of the ring, the mushroom does nothing. A mushroom will not sprout underneath an [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]] creature. Each mushroom only acts once."

    desc: "The giant mushrooms start to wilt and disappear 1 minute after all conscious living creatures have left the area. After 1 hour, the magic recharges, and the hazard is ready to trigger again."
