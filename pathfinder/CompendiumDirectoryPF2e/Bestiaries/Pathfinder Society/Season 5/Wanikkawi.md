  - name: "Demand Pact"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (auditory,linguistic,mental,occult) **Frequency** once per turn\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Wanikkawi attempts to force a creature within 30 feet that he is aware of to agree to a pact with him. The creature must attempt a `DC 25 Will check` save. Its effects depend on the variation; see below. Afterward, the creature gains temporary immunity for 1 day.\n* * *\n\nEach time you run this scenario, select one of the following variations to apply to Wanikkawi's Demand Pact ability:\n\n### Pact of Glory\n\nWanikkawi declares the target can attain fame by betraying their companions and staying out of the fight. He promises to let them survive the battle and claim that they drove him away despite the deaths of their friends. Demand Pact gains the following results:\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** Wanikkawi's hatred for others overcomes him. He does not treat any other creatures as allies for 1 round.\n\n**Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Failure** The creature does not treat any other creature as an ally for 1 round. It doesn't become hostile but can't take an action (such as [[Actions/Treat Wounds|Treat Wounds]] or Aid) or cast a spell to directly benefit any creature but itself. It doesn't count as an ally for the purposes of flanking.\n\n**Critical Failure** As above, but the creature also can't attack another creature. It can take actions that only target itself.\n\n### Pact of Survival\n\nWanikkawi suggests the PC can survive, as he did so many years ago, by [[Conditions/Fleeing|Fleeing]] the fire. Demand Pact gains the following results:\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** Wanikkawi remembers his own escape and must fight against that impulse. He gains a –10 status penalty to his speed for 1 round if he's in the firelight (–20 feet in bright light from the fire).\n\n**Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Failure** The creature is fleeing for a single action on its next turn.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature is fleeing for 1 round.\n\n### Pact of Power\n\nWanikkawi promises power by transforming them into a spirit, like he was. Demand Pact gains the following results:\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** Wanikkawi becomes [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] at the thought of his own transformation.\n\n**Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Failure** The creature takes on aspects of Wanikkawi's form for 1 minute. Because of this, if they enter or begin their turn in bright light caused by the fire, they become sickened 1 for 1 round.\n\n**Critical Failure** As above, except the creature becomes sickened 1 if they enter or begin their turn in any light by the fire and [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]] in bright light caused by the fire. This condition remains for 1 minute.\n\n### Pact of Erasure\n\nWanikkawi threatens the PC's true story will be forgotten, as his was. Demand Pact gains the following results:\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The truth of what Wanikkawi did suddenly hits him. He's unable to use reactions for 1 round.\n\n**Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Failure** The creature becomes [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]], inaudible, and otherwise imperceptible to its allies for 1 round.\n\n**Critical Failure** As above, but the creature's allies also forget about the creature for 1 round and can take no actions regarding the creature in that time. They remember the creature as usual after 1 round."

  - name: "Out of the Night"
    desc: "`pf2:2`  **Requirements** Wanikkawi is [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] to at least one enemy\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Wanikkawi Strides twice and makes a Strike against a creature he was hidden to at the start of his action at any point during his movement."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Swallow Whole|Swallow Whole]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (attack) Medium, 2d8+6 bludgeoning, Rupture 13\n* * *\n\nThe monster attempts to swallow a creature of the listed size or smaller that it has grabbed or restrained in its jaws or mouth. If a swallowed creature is of the maximum size listed, the monster can't use Swallow Whole again. If the creature is smaller than the maximum, the monster can usually swallow more creatures; the GM determines the maximum. The monster attempts an `Athletics check` check opposed by the grabbed creature's Reflex DC. If it succeeds, it swallows the creature. The monster's mouth or jaws no longer grab a creature it has swallowed, so the monster is free to use them to Strike or Grab once again. The monster can't attack creatures it has swallowed.\n\nA swallowed creature is [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]], is [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]], and has to hold its breath or start suffocating. The swallowed creature takes the listed amount of damage when first swallowed and at the end of each of its turns while it's swallowed. If the victim [[Actions/Escape|Escapes]] this ability's grabbed condition, it exits through the monster's mouth. This frees any other creature grabbed in the monster's mouth or jaws. A swallowed creature can attack the monster that has swallowed it, but only with unarmed attacks or with weapons of light Bulk or less. The swallowing creature is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] against the attack. If the monster takes piercing or slashing damage equaling or exceeding the listed Rupture value from a single attack or spell, the swallowed creature cuts itself free. A creature that gets free by either Escaping or cutting itself free can immediately breathe and exits the swallowing monster's space.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Engulf and Swallow Whole|Effect: Engulf and Swallow Whole]]\n\nIf the monster dies, a swallowed creature can be freed by creatures adjacent to the corpse if they spend a combined total of 3 actions cutting the monster open with a weapon or unarmed attack that deals piercing or slashing damage."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Grab|Grab]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** The monster's last action was a successful Strike that lists Grab in its damage entry, or the monster has a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]\n* * *\n\n**Effect** If used after a Strike, the monster attempts to [[Actions/grapple|grapple]] the creature using the body part it attacked with. This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."
