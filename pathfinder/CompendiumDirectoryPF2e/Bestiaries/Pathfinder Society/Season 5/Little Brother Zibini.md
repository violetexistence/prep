    desc: "`pf2:r` (air,primal) **Trigger** Zibini is the target of a physical ranged attack\n\n**Requirements** Zibini is aware of the attack\n* * *\n\n**Effect** A swift gale whips up between Zibini and the source of the ranged attack, giving Zibini a +2 status bonus to AC against the triggering attack. If the attack misses, the wind deflected it. The wind can't deflect unusually large or heavy ranged projectiles (such as boulders or ballista bolts)."
