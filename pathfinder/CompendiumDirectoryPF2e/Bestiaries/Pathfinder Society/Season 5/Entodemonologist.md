Those initiated into the hidden truths and forbidden secrets of the world are forever transformed-or so they claim. To the cynical, a mystic is nothing more than a charlatan or zealot. Others profess to sense an aura around such luminaries and treat them with reverence, lest they offend some harbinger of unspeakable doom.
