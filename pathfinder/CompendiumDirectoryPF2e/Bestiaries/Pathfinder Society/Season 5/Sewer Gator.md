It makes a jaws Strike with a +2 circumstance bonus to the attack roll against the grabbed creature. If it hits, it also does 2d4+7 bludgeoning damage and knocks the creature [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]. If it fails, it releases the creature."

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."
