    desc: " (aura,occult,visual) 30 feet. The hound echo's eyes glow balefully, causing the internal organs of a creature that meets its awful gaze to churn and spasm. When a creature ends its turn in the aura's emanation, it must succeed at a `DC 21 Fortitude check` save or be [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] (or [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]] on a critical failure). A creature that critically succeeds at its save is temporarily immune for 24 hours."

  - name: "Limited Angled Entry"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  The hound echo casts a 4th-level [[Spells/Translocate|Translocate]] spell, but it must transport itself into a space it can see that is adjacent to an angle of 90° (or more acute) in the structure or environment around it. For example, it could teleport to a space adjacent to a wall (using the angle between the wall and floor) or a corner in a room, or adjacent to a sizable tree growing straight up out of the ground, but not to a flat plain or a room with only curved corners and edges. It can't use Limited Angled Entry again for 1d4 rounds.\n\nOnce per day, the hound can use this ability to plane shift to or from the Dimension of Time, with the same restrictions on what angles it can appear next to."

Lean and athirst, the hounds of Tindalos are drawn to those who tamper with the flow of time, travel through time, or use magic or rare alchemical drugs to send their thoughts or perception back or forward in time. Powerful spellcasters can draw them from the Dimension of Time via rare rituals, but doing so attracts the hounds' ire, so few who traffic in such rituals live long enough to spread their knowledge. While the hounds possess great cunning and cruel intellect, they rarely interact with other creatures-other than to hunt and destroy those who have attracted their unblinking attention.

Once a hound catches scent of a mortal to hunt, it calls others of its ilk. The pack then pursues its victim through all space and time until it catches, slays and devours them. Those pursued can escape only by avoiding all angles, as hounds of Tindalos could step through them from nothingness at any time.
