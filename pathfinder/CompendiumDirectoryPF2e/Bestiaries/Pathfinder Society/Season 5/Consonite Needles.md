    desc: "`pf2:r` **Trigger** A creature touches any consonite needle\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The needle snaps, and the vibrations resonate with some of the surrounding needles. The falling minerals deal 2d8+7 untyped damage to creatures within a 5-foot burst surrounding the triggering individual (`DC 22 Reflex check` save). The needle fall doesn't involve every consonite growth within these squares, so can be triggered again from the same location."
