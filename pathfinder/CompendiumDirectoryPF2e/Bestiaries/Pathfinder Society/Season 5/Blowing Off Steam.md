    desc: "`pf2:r` **Trigger** A creature enters the area of the trap\n* * *\n\n**Effect** All four vents rapidly heat and let out steam for 5 seconds, filling room with a painfully acrid smell. Each creature in the room must attempt a `DC 26 Fortitude check` save, and the trap then rolls initiative.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]].\n\n**Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]] and [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]].\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 3]], and, struck by a coughing fit, falls [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]."

    desc: "(4 actions) Each of the four steam vents uses a single action each to emit superheated steam, which spreads for 60 feet along the wall from its location and extends out from the wall by 30 feet, dealing 2d10+11 untyped damage to each creature in their range (`DC 26 Fortitude check` save). For each disabled vent, the trap loses 1 action each turn."

    desc: "The steam vents cease to operate 1 minute after all creatures have left the area and go into a maintenance cycle for 1 hour. After this time, they can be triggered again."
