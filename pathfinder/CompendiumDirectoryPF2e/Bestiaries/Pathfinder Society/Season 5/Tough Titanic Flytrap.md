Additionally, it is exposed to the titanic flytrap toxin from the hundreds of tiny hairs that line the inside of its leaves. If the flytrap's jaws Strike was a critical success, the target takes a â€“2 circumstance penalty to its saving throws against this poison. At the end of each of target's turns that it remains grabbed, the target takes 3d8 acid damage."
