    desc: "`pf2:r` **Trigger** A creature touches any consonite cluster\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The needles snap, and the vibrations resonate with some of the surrounding clusters. The falling minerals deal 2d10+9 untyped damage to creatures within a 5-foot burst surrounding the triggering individual (`DC 22 Reflex check` save). The needle fall does not involve every consonite growth within these squares, so can be triggered again from the same location."
