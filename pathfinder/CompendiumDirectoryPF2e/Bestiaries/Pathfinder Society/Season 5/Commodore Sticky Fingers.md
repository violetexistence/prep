variant Draxie

The mischievous dragon sprites called draxies have dueled their pixie cousins for the title of ultimate prankster for centuries. They exercise patience and planning to create the perfect pranks, spending months, or even years, on their efforts. One exception to their flighty nature is the elucrea, a lifelong bond between a draxie and a creature they're particularly fond of, typically one with a good sense of humor. According to draxie legend, a little piece of a draxie's spirit remembers being united as the ancient fey dragonet Elucredassa, and that causes draxies to yearn for such connections with others.

Elusive, flighty, and ebullient, sprites are what many villagers first imagine when they hear the terms "fey" or "fairy." While their dispositions vary, all sprites share a connection to magic and a diminutive size. This family of fey shares its name with its slightest and most populous member, the common sprite.
