Variant female kurobozu

A monk who violated their monastic vows in life might arise after death to become an undead horror known as a kurobozu. These predators feast upon the breath of mortals, creeping on twisted limbs into bedrooms to steal the life from sleeping victims. This act of feeding leaves its mark on the victim in the form of a vile scent of rot on the victim's breath and a debilitating disease that eventually results in exhaustion and finally death.

Kurobozus retain echoes of their ascetic training, enabling them to suck the breath from debilitated foes in the midst of battle. Their malevolent cunning combined with ascetic discipline helps them concoct elaborate and lengthy schemes to enact their jealous revenge. Few kurobozus are convincing enough to persuade their onetime allies to break their own oaths, but this doesn't stop them from making the attempt.
