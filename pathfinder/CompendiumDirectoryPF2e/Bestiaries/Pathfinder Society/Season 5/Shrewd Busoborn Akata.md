    desc: "  After 3 or more days without eating, an akata can secrete resin that encases it in a noqual cocoon. The cocoon has Hardness 9, 40 HP, and a Broken Threshold of 18. It has resistance 5 to damage from magical sources. As long as the cocoon remains intact, the akata can't be harmed, and it doesn't need to eat or drink. While inside the cocoon, the akata gains [[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Lifesense|Lifesense]] 30 feet. The akata remains in a state of hibernation until it is exposed to extreme heat or senses a living creature, at which point it can burst free of its cocoon in 1d4 minutes."

    desc: "`pf2:2` (manipulate) The busoborn akata presses one of its tentacle vines to the ground and causes it to spread beneath creatures in a 15-foot cone in front of it. Until the end of its next turn, the area is difficult terrain to enemy creatures, and the akata gains a +2 circumstance bonus to attack rolls against targets within that area\n* * *\n\n**Special** The akata can only use this ability if it has no more than one creature grappled."

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

An akata is a hairless, blue-skinned quadruped with fearsome jaws, glowing eyes, a pair of thin tails, and a mane of writhing tentacles. It is a strangely silent beast, as it lacks the lungs and vocal chords necessary to vocalize. It also lacks ears, but it has heightened visual and olfactory senses.

When food is scarce, an akata secretes a resin from its pores that forms into a sturdy cocoon of pale green crystal-the skymetal noqual. An akata can hibernate in this cocoon without needing to eat or drink for centuries, though it retains a rudimentary sense of its surroundings and can break out in only a few minutes' time. These cocoons allow the creatures to travel through the void of space, seeking new worlds where they can infect suitable humanoid hosts with their larval young. Once a victim succumbs to this infection, the offspring fight among themselves until one proves the strongest. The surviving akata then animates the corpse-now a void zombie-which shambles about of its own accord.
