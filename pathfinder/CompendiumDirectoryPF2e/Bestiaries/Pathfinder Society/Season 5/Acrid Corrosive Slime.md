After moving, all squares the Corrosive Slime moves from or through count as Difficult Terrain until the end of the corrosive slime's next turn.

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."
