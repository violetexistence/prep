    desc: "`pf2:r`  **Trigger** A creature within the monster's reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The monster attempts a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, the monster disrupts that action. This Strike doesn't count toward the monster's multiple attack penalty, and its multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike."

After the first 24 hours outside of water, they gain a â€“1 status penalty to Fortitude saves as their skin cracks and their gills become painful. After 48 hours, they struggle to breathe air and begin to suffocate until returned to water."
