    desc: "`pf2:r`  **Trigger** A creature within the monster's reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The monster attempts a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, the monster disrupts that action. This Strike doesn't count toward the monster's multiple attack penalty, and its multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike."

  - name: "Double Opportunity"
    desc: "  The two-headed goat gains an extra reaction each round that it can use only to make Attacks of Opportunity. It must use a different head for each reaction, and it can't use more than one on the same triggering action. If it loses one of its heads, it also loses this extra reaction."

  - name: "Two Headed"
    desc: "  Any ability that would sever one of the twoheaded goat's heads (such as a critical hit with a vorpal weapon) severs one head at random. Losing a head doesn't kill the two-headed goat (as long as it has one head left), but it does prevent it from making Strikes with the lost head or using the head's Breath Weapon."

  - name: "Two-Headed Strike"
    desc: "`pf2:2`  **Frequency** once per turn\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The two-headed goat makes a Strike with two of its heads, each at a â€“2 penalty and targeting a different creature. These Strikes count as only one attack for the two-headed goat's multiple attack penalty, and the penalty doesn't increase until after it has made both attacks."
