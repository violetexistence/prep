Skilled kizidhar mages and gardeners handcraft these lovely creatures as much for their shuyookhs' aesthetic pleasure as for their protection. Creating a snapdrake requires first painstakingly constructing a frame of living wood in the shape of a drake before weaving thousands of colorful snapdragon flowers into intricate patterns to form its body and scales. Once complete, snapdrakes often serve kizidhars as a combination of guards, pets, and decorations for as long as they are well fed.
