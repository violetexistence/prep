    desc: "`pf2:2` (divine,void) 287's ghost touches a creature in reach. If the target is a living creature it takes damage from the ghost's ghostly hand with a `DC 30 Fortitude check` save. If the ghost is in their living visage they can disguise Feed on the Living as a benign touch and delay the effects for 1 minute while keeping the target unaware of the effect. A creature can be affected by only one delayed Feed on the Living at a time and if the ghost loses their living visage during that minute the Feed on the Living is lost.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target's life energy overpowers the ghost. 287's ghost takes 5 vitality damage, and the target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The target takes half damage, and the ghost regains HP equal to the damage dealt.\n\n**Failure** The target takes full damage and is [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]] for 1 minute and the ghost regains HP equal to the damage dealt.\n\n**Critical Failure** The target takes double damage and is [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 2]] for 1 minute and the ghost regains HP equal to the damage dealt."

On a failure, a creature becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] (or [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 3]] on a critical failure). On a success, a creature is temporarily immune to this ghost's frightful moan for 1 minute."

If the ghost hasn't consumed enough HP, they mindlessly and recklessly feed on any living creature they come across until satiated."

    desc: "`pf2:2` (divine) The ghost cries out in pain and anguish as small objects and debris fly about in a 30-foot emanation. Creatures in this area take 6d6 bludgeoning damage, subject to a basic `DC 30 Reflex check` save."
