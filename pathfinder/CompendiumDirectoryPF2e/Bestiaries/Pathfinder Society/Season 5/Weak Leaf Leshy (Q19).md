    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,polymorph,primal) The leaf leshy transforms into a Small tree. This ability otherwise uses the effects of [[Spells/One with Plants|One with Plants]].\n* * *\n\nThe monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

  - name: "Glide"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (move) The leshy glides gently through the air, moving 5 feet toward the ground and up to 25 feet forward. As long as the leshy spends at least 1 action gliding each round, it remains in the air at the end of each turn. For the purpose of determining damage from falls, a leaf leshy always treats falls as if they were 20 feet shorter."

Leaf leshys are diminutive protectors of forests clad in pine cone armor and hats of fruit, flowers, or leaves. They enjoy mock battles but act cautiously in real ones.

* * *

Leshys are intelligent plant creatures that guard areas of primeval wilderness or earthly power. Originally created by powerful fey, they manifest when a skilled practitioner of primal magic-typically a druid-combines a nature spirit with a body carefully grown from local vegetation. The rites and materials required to create a leshy vary depending on the type of leshy. They are typically given life in an area of great natural significance, such as an arboreal's grove, a druidic circle, a fairy ring, or a great natural wonder.
