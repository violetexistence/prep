    desc: "  The wail of a timewarped amalgam transfers fragments of the amalgam's pain onto those who hear it. The target must succeed at a `DC 17 Will check` saving throw or become [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] ([[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]] on a critical failure). After attempting this save, a creature is temporarily immune to Anguish for 24 hours."
