Werecreatures are humanoids who transform into animals and animal-humanoid hybrids under the light of the full moon. The fate of these shapechanging creatures derives from an ancient primal curse that they can, in turn, transmit through their own bites. The stat blocks in this section reflect werecreatures in their hybrid forms.

* * *

Werebats form organized colonies of opportunistic hunters. They aren't shy about transforming creatures to add to their colony, whom they initiate with elaborate social ceremonies and bloody hazing. The curse of the werebat gives them a strong urge to prey upon on weaker, lonely creatures. True werebats are often unusually tall and thin, with angular features. In combat, werebats favor their unarmed attacks because they can't fly while wielding weapons in their wings.
