Variant watch officer

Watch officers are assigned to a certain area within a city or community. Often leading a small team of lower-ranking guards, they patrol those areas to maintain order and enforce laws. Watch officers get the job done, though their methods are not always gentle or kind. Because the watch officer is responsible to their superiors for their area, they sometimes need to make tough decisions between justice and effectiveness.

* * *

Larger societies rely on those with the authority and the ability to interpret and enforce laws. In good-aligned societies, these officials carry out their duties fairly. In neutral and evil ones, these officials can be harsh and cruel (with an altered alignment to reflect this), imposing severe punishments on those who can't pay for mercy.
