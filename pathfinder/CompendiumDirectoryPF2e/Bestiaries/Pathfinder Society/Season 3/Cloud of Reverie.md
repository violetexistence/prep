    desc: "`pf2:r` (poison) **Trigger** The chest is opened\n\n**Effect** All creatures within 10 feet of the chest inhale the dust and become [[Conditions/Fascinated|Fascinated]] and [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]] (`DC 20 Fortitude check` save to negate both effects). The fascinated effect lasts for 1 minute, as the target enters a calm and dreamy stupor looking at into the receding dust mist. As usual, the fatigued condition lasts until the affected creature receives a full night's rest."
