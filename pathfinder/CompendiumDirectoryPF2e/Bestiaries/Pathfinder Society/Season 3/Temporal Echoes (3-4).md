    desc: "`pf2:1` (occult) The temporal echo shifts rapidly between multiple timelines, becoming [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]]. As the nature of this effect leaves the echo's location obvious, it can't use this concealment to Hide or Sneak. This effect lasts for 1 minute, or until the echo is dealt any damage."

    desc: "`pf2:2` (occult) The temporal echo screams, causing time to shudder and bend around it. All creatures in a 10-foot emanation take 3d6 mental damage (`DC 15 Will check` save). Creatures that critically fail the saving throw are [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] for 1 round. The echo can't use Temporal Shudder again for 1d4 rounds."
