    desc: "(2 actions) The haunt uses its first action to stir up a storm of debris against all creatures in the quadrant clockwise from where it last attacked. Creatures in the quadrant take 2d4+4 bludgeoning damage (`DC 18 Reflex check`). For each additional action it has (at most 1 without adjustments from the scaling sidebar), the storm targets an additional quadrant, moving clockwise around the area. On the first round, it begins by attacking creatures in the northwestern quadrant."
  - name: "Reset"
    desc: "The storm continues raging for 1 minute unless disabled, and then dissipates, returning after 1 week."
