    desc: "`DC 17 Survival check` (trained) to find and remove the stones blocking the flow of water to the mud pot. The water decreases the viscosity of the mud, allowing steam and sulfur to escape gradually, rather than in violent bursts, so creatures can pass through unharmed. The hazard requires two successful checks to disable. Attempting the check takes two actions."
