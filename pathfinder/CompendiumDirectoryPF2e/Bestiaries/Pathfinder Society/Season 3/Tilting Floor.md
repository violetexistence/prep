    desc: "`pf2:r` **Trigger** A creature moves on the unstable floor\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The floor tilts into a steep incline. Any creature on the tilting floor must succeed at either a `DC 20 Reflex check` save or a `DC 17 Acrobatics check` {Acrobatics check to Balance} (the creature chooses) or else take 1d6+3 bludgeoning damage as it slams into the wall.\n\n**Critical Success** The creature takes no damage. It keeps its footing and can move freely across the floor this round.\n\n**Success** The creature takes no damage but is somewhat off-balance; the floor is difficult terrain for the creature this round.\n\n**Failure** The creature slides backward into the wall, taking full damage.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature slides backward into the wall with great force, taking double damage."
