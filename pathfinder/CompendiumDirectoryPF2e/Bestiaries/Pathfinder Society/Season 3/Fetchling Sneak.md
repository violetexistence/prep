    desc: "`pf2:2`  **Requirements** The fetchling sneak is in an area of dim light or darkness\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The fetchling sneak sticks to the shadows as it moves to ambush an enemy. The fetchling sneak Strides up to half their Speed and makes a Strike. The sneak's target is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] against this attack. The fetchling sneak can choose to Stride up to their full speed, but doing causes the sneak to take a -2 penalty to their Strike."
