    desc: "`pf2:r`  **Trigger** A creature within the monster's reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The monster attempts a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, the monster disrupts that action. This Strike doesn't count toward the monster's multiple attack penalty, and its multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike."

  - name: "Reinforced Loyalty"
    desc: "  The commander is resistant to mind-affecting magics due to their repeated exposure to Marcien Blakros's enchantments. Whenever the commander rolls a success on a Will save against an enchantment or fear effect, they get a critical success instead, unless that effect originated from Marcien. In addition, anytime they gain the [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened]] condition, reduce its value by 1."
