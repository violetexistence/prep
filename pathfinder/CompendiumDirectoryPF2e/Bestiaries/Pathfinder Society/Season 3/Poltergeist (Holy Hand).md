Each creature within 30 feet must attempt a `DC 21 Will check` save, becoming [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] on a failure. On a critical failure, it's also [[Conditions/Fleeing|Fleeing]] for as long as it's frightened. On a success, the creature is temporarily immune for 1 minute.

    desc: "`pf2:2` (concentrate,occult) The poltergeist telekinetically throws numerous small objects, such as dozens of pieces of silverware or books, either spreading them out among multiple foes or directing them at one target.\n\n*   When this effect is spread out among multiple foes, the poltergeist makes a telekinetic object Strike at a -2 penalty against each creature within 30 feet. These count as one attack for the poltergeist's multiple attack penalty, and the penalty doesn't increase until after all the attacks.\n*   When this effect has only one target, the poltergeist makes a telekinetic object Strike against the target, and the damage increases to 3d12. It deals 1d12 untyped damage on a failure, and no damage on a critical failure."

When a creature dies, and for whatever reason its spirit is unable or unwilling to leave the site of its death, that spirit may manifest as a poltergeist: a restless invisible spirit that is still able to manipulate physical objects. Many poltergeists perished in a way that resulted from or has led to extreme emotional trauma.
