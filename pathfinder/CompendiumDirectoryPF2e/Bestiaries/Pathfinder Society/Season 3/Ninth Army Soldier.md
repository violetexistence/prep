Variant bounty hunter

Bounty hunters are constantly on the move, whether within city walls or the wilderness, trailing their fugitive quarries for capture... or disposal. Often relying on stealth or deception as much as martial skill, bounty hunters employ a vast array of talents to accomplish their goals, not to mention to collect the hefty payout that follows.
