  - name: "Shadow Doubles"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (illusion,occult,shadow) `pf2:1` or `pf2:2`:\n\n**Frequency** once per day\n* * *\n\n**Effect** For each action spent to use this ability, Marcien creates one shadowy duplicate of himself anywhere within 60 feet of himself. Shadow doubles have the same statistics as Marcien, but they have the summoned trait, have 18 Hit Points, can't use Shadow Doubles or cast spells, their pistols do not cause Curse of Conflicted Loyalties, and they have an attack bonus of +14 for their pistol Strikes and +10 for their staff Strikes. A shadow double that attempts a saving throw against a light effect can't get a result better than failure. Each double remains for 1 round, until it's reduced to 0 Hit Points, or until it moves further than 60 feet from Marcien, whichever comes first. Each round thereafter, Marcien can spend a single action that has the concentrate trait to extend the duration of surviving duplicates by 1 round, to a maximum duration of 5 rounds. Marcien can see through the eyes of all of the shadow doubles at once. A character who Seeks can identify a creature as the real Marcien or a shadow double with a successful `DC 27 Perception check` check."
