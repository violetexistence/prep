    desc: "  The first time the enduring zombie hulk is critically hit with a melee or ranged Strike, a limb falls off its body and continues to attack. The limb acts on the zombie's initiative; each round it can Stride up to half the zombie's Speed and make a hunk of meat or corpse Strike. The limb uses and contributes to the zombie hulk's multiple attack penalty."

  - name: "Corpse Throwing"
    desc: "  A zombie hulk can throw corpses at foes. While any Medium dead body will do, they sometimes throw [[Monster Core/Zombie Shambler|Zombie Shamblers]], who take just as much damage from being thrown as the target they hit. A thrown shambler lands [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]], but if it's not destroyed, it can rise and use other actions normally."

    desc: "`pf2:2` (manipulate) If the enduring zombie hulk is adjacent to a helpless or [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]] creature, or a deceased creature that died in the past hour, the zombie hulk can feast upon its flesh to heal itself. This restores 8 healing Hit Points to the zombie hulk and deals the creature 2d10+13 bludgeoning damage."

  - name: "Wide Swing"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  The zombie hulk makes a hunk of meat Strike and compares the attack roll result to the AC of up to two foes, each of whom must be within the Strike's reach. This attack counts as two attacks for the zombie hulk's multiple attack penalty."

A zombie's only desire is to consume the living. Unthinking and ever-shambling harbingers of death, zombies stop only when they're destroyed.
