    desc: "`pf2:r`  **Trigger** A creature within the monster's reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The monster attempts a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, the monster disrupts that action. This Strike doesn't count toward the monster's multiple attack penalty, and its multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike."

    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,polymorph,primal) The weretiger changes into their animal, human, or hybrid shape; they are presented in their animal shape. Each shape has a specific, persistent appearance.\n\nIn human or hybrid form, the weretiger's size changes to Medium, they lose their Wrestle ability, and their speed decreases to 25 feet. In human form, they also lose their jaws and claw Strikes and gain a melee fist Strike (+14 for 1d4+7 bludgeoning damage).\n* * *\n\nThe monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

  - name: "Curse of the Weretiger"
    desc: " (curse,primal) This curse affects only humanoids\n\n**Saving Throw** `DC 21 Fortitude check`.\n\nOn each full moon, the cursed creature must succeed at another Fortitude save or turn into the same kind of werecreature until dawn. The creature is under the GM's control and goes on a rampage for half the night before falling unconscious until dawn."

  - name: "Moon Frenzy"
    desc: " (polymorph,primal) When a full moon appears in the night sky, the weretiger must enter hybrid form and can't Change Shape thereafter. When the moon sets or the sun rises, the weretiger returns to humanoid form and is [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]] for 2d4 hours."

  - name: "Wrestle"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  The weretiger makes a claw Strike against a creature it is grabbing. If the attack hits, that creature is knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]. A weretiger can only use this ability in animal form."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Grab|Grab]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** The monster's last action was a successful Strike that lists Grab in its damage entry, or the monster has a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]\n* * *\n\n**Effect** If used after a Strike, the monster attempts to [[Actions/grapple|grapple]] the creature using the body part it attacked with. This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

These ferocious werecreatures stalk prey with the cunning and skill of a true apex predator. Weretigers typically view all life as a potential meal. Powerful nocturnal hunters with excellent senses that help them ambush prey, weretigers are adaptable to an extreme range of environments. However, weretigers living in densely populated cities (potentially as courtesans, assassins, or guild leaders) often struggle to suppress their killer instincts, becoming overwhelmed by the urge to hunt. They prefer to wear loose-fitting clothing and rely on their claws and jaws in a fight.

Werecreatures transform into animals and animal-humanoid hybrids under the light of the full moon. The doomed fate of these shapechanging creatures derives from an ancient primal curse that they can, in turn, transmit through their own bites. The stat blocks in this section reflect werecreatures in their hybrid forms.
