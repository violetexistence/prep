    desc: "  The rat is connected to an explosive harness, which displays an ominous 1-minute pocket watch. The harness will explode after 1 minute (10 rounds) if it is not disabled, or immediately if the rat takes fire damage. This explosion deals 2d6 fire damage to the rat and all creatures within a 5-foot burst (`DC 15 Reflex check` save) and ignites flammable objects in the area.\n\nIf the rat is [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grappled]], [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]], or [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]], an adjacent creature can attempt to safely remove and disable the harness with a successful `DC 17 Nature check` or `DC 17 Thievery check` check or a successful `DC 15 Tanning Lore check` check. An attempt to disable the harness uses two actions."
