    desc: "  24 hours (2 hours remaining), `DC 15 Thievery check`, standby\n* * *\n\nFor a clockwork to act, it must be wound with a unique key by another creature. This takes 1 minute. Once wound, it remains operational for the listed amount of time, usually 24 hours, after which time it becomes unaware of its surroundings and can't act until it's wound again. Some clockworks' abilities require them to spend some of their remaining operational time. They can't spend more than they have and shut down immediately once they have 0 time remaining. If it's unclear when a clockwork was last wound, most clockwork keepers wind all their clockworks at a set time, typically 8 a.m.\n\nA clockwork that lists standby in its wind-up entry can enter standby mode as a 3-action activity. Its operational time doesn't decrease in standby, but it can sense its surroundings (with a -2 penalty to Perception). It can't act, with one exception: when it perceives a creature, it can exit standby as a reaction (rolling initiative if appropriate).\n\nA creature can attempt to Disable a Device to wind a clockwork down (with a DC listed in the wind-up entry). For each success, the clockwork loses 1 hour of operational time. This can be done even if the clockwork is in standby mode."

Because Junior is damaged, the construct can't control its assistants, so the object acts on its own. The object fights using the statistics for an animated knickknack, attacking the nearest living creatures. It ceases to be animated after 1 hour, or if Junior is disabled or destroyed."

If Junior has no uses of Animate Assistants remaining, or there are no objects within range, the construct instead does nothing.\n*   3-4: Junior spends as many actions as are necessary to Stride to the nearest living creature, then uses its remaining actions to make fist Strikes against that creature."
