Nightmares and their riders can see through this smoke. A creature that begins its turn in the area becomes [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]] (`DC 20 Fortitude check` negates) and is then temporarily immune sickness from the smoke for 1 minute. The nightmare, its rider, any creature currently holding its breath (or that does not need to breathe), and any creature immune to poison are immune to the aura's sickened effect but not the concealment."
