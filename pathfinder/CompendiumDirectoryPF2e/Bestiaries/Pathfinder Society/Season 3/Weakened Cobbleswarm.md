    desc: "  A cobbleswarm's tremorsense is a precise sense out to 40 feet and an imprecise sense out to 80 feet. A cobbleswarm can't sense anything beyond the range of its tremorsense.\n* * *\n\nTremorsense allows a monster to feel the vibrations through a solid surface caused by movement. It is an imprecise sense with a limited range (listed in the ability). Tremorsense functions only if the monster is on the same surface as the subject, and only if the subject is moving along (or burrowing through) the surface."

Spawned from a Cobbled Bruiser

Busy road builders might unknowingly use cobble mites in construction.

* * *

Cobble mites resemble squarish stones a few inches across with mouths like split geodes. Though indolent and harmless alone, they're dangerous in large groups.
