    desc: "`pf2:1` (occult) The temporal echo shifts rapidly between multiple timelines, becoming [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]]. As the nature of this effect leaves the echo's location obvious, it can't use this concealment to Hide or Sneak. This effect lasts for 1 minute, or until the echo is dealt any damage."
