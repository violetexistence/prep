Variant Guard

Guards are rank-and-file members of a town watch or city guard, trained to look for trouble, take down criminals, and follow orders. They are a match for only the most fledgling of adventurers and criminals, but, given time, the settlement can usually muster them in numbers sufficient to neutralize most threats.

* * *

Larger societies rely on those with the authority and the ability to interpret and enforce laws. In good-aligned societies, these officials carry out their duties fairly. In neutral and evil ones, these officials can be harsh and cruel (with an altered alignment to reflect this), imposing severe punishments on those who can't pay for mercy.
