    desc: "`pf2:r` (divine) **Trigger** A creature touches or disturbs the umbral vise.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Natron sprays out of the tub, infusing all creatures adjacent to the tub with void energy and desiccating their internal organs. Each creature takes 2d10+4 void damage and 2d10+4 poison damage (`DC 32 Fortitude check` save). On a failure, the internal damage makes the creature more susceptible to other effects that would cause it to mummify, such as Mummy Rot. For 1 day, the first time it is exposed to such an effect, it uses the outcome one degree of success worse than the result of its saving throw."
