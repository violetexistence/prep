    desc: "`pf2:r` **Trigger** A living creature bearing _Hunger's Call_ moves within 30 feet of the exit stairs\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Whispering voices fill the triggering creature's mind with a compulsion for blood of the living. The creature must attempt a `DC 20 Will check` save, and the haunt then rolls initiative.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The target is [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]].\n\n**Failure** The target is [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 2]].\n\n**Critical Failure** The target loses control of their mind and on their next round must move to the nearest ally and make an unarmed bite attack. The ally is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] against this attack. The bite deals 1d4 piercing damage and a critical hit deals an additional 1 bleed damage. At the end of their turn, the target regains control of their mind."
