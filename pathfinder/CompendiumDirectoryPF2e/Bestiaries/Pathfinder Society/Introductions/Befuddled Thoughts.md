    desc: "`pf2:r` (mental, occult) **Trigger** A living creature bearing _Hunger's Call_ moves within 30 feet of the exit stairs\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The creature's mind becomes hazy and foggy as an unseen voice says to drop the relic and walk away. The creature must attempt a `DC 20 Will check` save, and the haunt then rolls initiative.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The target is [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] for 1 round.\n\n**Failure** The target is dazzled for 1 minute.\n\n**Critical Failure** The target loses control of their mind and on their next round must set _Hunger's Call_ on the floor and move their speed in a direction away from the relic; this causes the relic to teleport itself back to area D1. If they have any actions remaining, the target loses those actions. At the end of their turn, the target regains control of their mind."
