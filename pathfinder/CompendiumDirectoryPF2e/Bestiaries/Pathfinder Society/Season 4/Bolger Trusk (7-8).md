These typically include [[Monster Core/Rat Swarm|Rat Swarms]], [[Monster Core/Vampire Bat Swarm|Bat Swarms]], and [[Monster Core/Wolf|Wolves]], but can include other creatures.\n\nThe vampire can give telepathic orders to these creatures as long as they are within 100 feet, but they can't communicate back."

  - name: "[[Creature Family Ability Glossary/(Vampire, Basic) Coffin Restoration|Coffin Restoration]]"
    desc: " (divine,void) Unlike other undead, a vampire isn't destroyed at 0 HP. Instead, it falls [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]]. If its body rests in its coffin for 1 hour, the vampire gains 1 HP, after which its fast healing begins to function normally."

  - name: "Mist Evasion"
    desc: "`pf2:r`  **Trigger** Bolger would take damage from a critical hit, or from critically failing a saving throw against a damaging effect.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Bolger's body briefly evaporates into the surrounding mists, dispersing the triggering attack. The attack has the results of a failure instead of a critical success."

  - name: "[[Creature Family Ability Glossary/(Vampire, Basic) Vampire Vulnerabilities|Vampire Weaknesses]]"
    desc: "  All vampires possess the following weaknesses.\n\n*   **Compulsions** Vampires are creatures of strange and unknowable compulsions. A typical vampire can't voluntarily cross running water unless it is transported while it hides within its coffin, nor can it enter a private dwelling unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. At your discretion, vampires might have different compulsions-a pirate vampire might not be able to set foot on solid ground without being invited, for example. The vampire can still be forced to do these things and might be able to overcome its compulsion just as it does its revulsion.\n*   **Revulsion** A vampire can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of brandished garlic or a brandished religious symbol of a non-evil deity. To brandish garlic or a religious symbol, a creature must Interact to do so for 1 round (similar to Raising a Shield). If the vampire involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of its revulsion, it gains the [[Conditions/Fleeing|Fleeing]] condition, running from the object of its revulsion until it ends an action beyond 10 feet. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of its revulsion, a vampire can attempt a `DC 25 Will check` save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, it overcomes its revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success).\n*   **Stake** A wooden stake driven through a vampire's heart drops the vampire to 0 HP and prevents it from healing above 0 HP, even in its coffin. Staking a vampire requires three actions and works only if the vampire is unconscious. If the stake is removed, the vampire can heal above 0 HP again, and if it's in its coffin the 1-hour rest period begins once the stake is removed. If the vampire's head is severed and anointed with _[[Equipment/Holy Water|Holy Water]]_ while the stake is in place, the vampire is destroyed.\n*   **Sunlight** If exposed to direct sunlight, a vampire immediately becomes [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]]. The slowed value increases by 1 each time the vampire ends its turn in sunlight. If the vampire loses all its actions in this way, it is destroyed. Due to their supernatural aversion to light, vampires don't cast shadows or show a reflection in mirrors."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Void Healing|Void Healing]]"
    desc: "  A creature with void healing draws health from void energy rather than vitality energy. It is damaged by vitality damage and is not healed by vitality healing effects. It does not take void damage, and it is healed by void effects that heal undead."

  - name: "[[Creature Family Ability Glossary/(Vampire, True) Change Shape|Change Shape]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,divine,polymorph) The vampire transforms into its animal form or back into its normal form.\n\n*   **Bat** The vampire changes into a [[Monster Core/Giant Bat|Giant Bat]]\n    \n    *   **Size** Large\n    *   **Senses** Echolocation 40 feet\n    *   **Speed** 20 feet, fly 30 feet\n    *   **Melee** fangs +19/+14/+9, **Damage** 2d8+9 piercing damage\n* * *\n\nThe monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

  - name: "[[Creature Family Ability Glossary/(Vampire, True) Create Servitor|Create Spawn]]"
    desc: " (divine,downtime) If a creature dies after being reduced to 0 HP by Drink Blood, the vampire can turn this victim into a vampire by donating some of its own blood to the victim and burying the victim in earth for 3 nights.\n\nIf the new vampire is lower level than its creator, it is under the creator's control. If a vampire controls too many spawn at once (as determined by the GM), strong-willed spawn can free themselves by succeeding at a `Will check` saving throw against the vampire's Will DC."

  - name: "[[Creature Family Ability Glossary/(Vampire, True) Dominate|Dominate]]"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (divine,incapacitation,mental,visual) The vampire can cast [[Spells/Dominate|Dominate]] at will as a divine innate spell. Casting it requires staring into the target's eyes, giving the spell the visual trait. The save DC uses the DC of the vampire's level, and a creature that succeeds is temporarily immune to that vampire's Dominate for 24 hours.\n\nFully destroying the vampire ends the domination, but merely reducing the vampire to 0 HP is insufficient to break the spell."

  - name: "Drain Bonded Item"
    desc: " (arcane,wizard) **Frequency** Once per day.\n\n**Requirements** Bolger hasn't acted yet on this turn.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The vampire expends the power stored in its signet ring. This gives Bolger the ability to cast one prepared spell he had already previously cast today, without spending a spell slot. He must still Cast the Spell and meet the spell's other requirements."

  - name: "[[Creature Family Ability Glossary/(Vampire, True) Drink Blood|Drink Blood]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (divine) **Requirements** A [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]], [[Conditions/Paralyzed|Paralyzed]], [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]], [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]], or willing creature is within the vampire's reach.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The vampire sinks its fangs into that creature to drink its blood. This requires an `Athletics check` check against the victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions.\n\nThe victim is [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 2]] and the vampire regains 10 healing Hit Points, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the vampire but increases the victim's drain value by 1. A vampire can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but it gains no HP from doing so.\n\nA victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a `DC 20 Medicine check` check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drain by 1 after 10 minutes."

  - name: "Steady Spellcasting"
    desc: "  If another creature's reaction would disrupt Bolger's spellcasting action, the vampire attempts a `DC 15 Flat check` check. If he succeeds, his action isn't disrupted."

  - name: "[[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Grab|Grab]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  **Requirements** The monster's last action was a successful Strike that lists Grab in its damage entry, or the monster has a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]\n* * *\n\n**Effect** If used after a Strike, the monster attempts to [[Actions/grapple|grapple]] the creature using the body part it attacked with. This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."
