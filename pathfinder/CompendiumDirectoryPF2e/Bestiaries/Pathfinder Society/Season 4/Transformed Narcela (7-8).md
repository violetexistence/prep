Until the end of her next turn, each enemy within 60 feet of Narcela takes a -1 item penalty to Will saves. The benefits of Hold the Heart immediately end. Narcela can't use Hold the Heart again for 1d6 rounds, as her heart needs time to regenerate.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Heart Break|Effect: Heart Break]]"

This bloodstone is a lesser version of a night hag's heartstone; as long as she holds it, Narcela gains a +1 item bonus to Will saves."

  - name: "Scream of Spite"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (auditory,emotion,mental,occult) Narcela lets out a scream laden with all her rage, spreading Aslynn's ritual transmogrifying magic to any creature that can hear her. All creatures within a 30-foot emanation must attempt a `DC 26 Will check` save; creatures with the hag trait are immune to this effect. Narcela can't use Scream of Spite again for 1d4 rounds.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature is [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]] as it resists the effects.\n\n**Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]] for 1 round as it tries to keep its thoughts its own.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature is confused for 1d4 rounds."
