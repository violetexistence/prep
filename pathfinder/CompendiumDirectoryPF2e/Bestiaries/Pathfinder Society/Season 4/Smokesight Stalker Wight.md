Variant prowler wight

Often found lurking in the dark, prowler wights wield subterfuge as their greatest weapon. They frequently feign death in old sewers, graveyards, and mausoleums, waiting for hapless victims to pass by before striking.

Wights are undead beings of spite who primarily stalk places related to death.
