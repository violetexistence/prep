Variant skunk

With their distinctive black bodies and white stripes or spots, skunks are instantly recognizable to most creatures. Those who catch a full blast of musk rarely decide to trouble a skunk again, as the revolting stench can linger for hours or even days. Removing the odor is difficult, typically requiring the aid of alchemy or magic.

These omnivores are most active at twilight, feeding on everything from berries to grubs and insects. Some farmers even encourage the animals to live near their farms to keep destructive pest populations low.
