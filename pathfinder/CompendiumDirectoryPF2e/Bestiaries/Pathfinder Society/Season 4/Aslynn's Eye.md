If the target's Hit Points were lower than the damage dealt, the Aslynn's eye gains temporary Hit Points equal to their remaining Hit Points instead.\n\n**Failure** As success, but target takes 2d6 mental damage and is [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] for 1 round.\n\n**Critical Failure** As success, but target takes 4d6 mental damage and is [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] for 1 minute."

  - name: "Mirror Travel"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (occult,teleportation) An Aslynn's eye can crawl into any mirror within their reach as if it were a door or window, instantly transporting them as well as any items they're wearing and holding to another mirror within 500 feet. The Aslynn's eye can remain within the mirror indefinitely or, provided they're using their Mirrored Transformation ability, they may choose to exit a mirror as part of any action they take with the Move trait. An Aslynn's eye can't exit a mirror unless they're using their Mirrored Transformation ability to take a specific creature's form. An Aslynn's eye can't exit a mirror that has the broken condition."

  - name: "Mirrored Transformation"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,occult,polymorph) An Aslynn's eye takes the appearance of a mirrored version of any Large or smaller creature who they have seen and whose appearance they remember. While those who are not familiar with the subject of their mimicry may be fooled by the disguise, those who know the subject well automatically notice the mirroring effect. This ability doesn't change the Speed of the Aslynn's eye or their attack and damage bonuses with its Strikes but might change the damage type their Strikes deal."

  - name: "Psychic Assault"
    desc: " (mental,occult) The Aslynn's eye imbues their attacks with a psychic assault, infusing the mind of the creature struck with hideous nightmare visions and hallucinations. A creature damaged by the Aslynn's eye's fist must succeed at a `DC 21 Fortitude check` save or be [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] for 1 round. On a critical failure, the target is dazzled for 1d4 rounds and [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] for 1 round."
