Apply the bugbear radier's multiple attack penalty to the Strikes normally."

Variant bugbear tormentor

The bugbear tormentor seeks to torture their prey as much through psychological intimidation as through physical harm. The longer a bugbear tormentor can keep their victim alive and terrified, the better they feel.

* * *

These stealthy and cruel goblinoid creatures delight in spreading fear and tormenting their victims. Bugbears are the monsters lurking in the closet and hiding under the bed. Preying on remote farmsteads, bugbears reveal their presence with thumps in the night or creaks of boards to build lurking dread and arouse suspicion and fear.
