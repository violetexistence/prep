  - name: "Dream Eating"
    desc: "`pf2:3` (curse,manipulate,mental,occult) An Aslynn's sharper eye can consume the subconscious dreams of a creature within 30 feet; the creature must attempt a `DC 24 Will check` save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected and is temporarily immune to the Aslynn's sharper eye's dream eating for 1 day.\n\n**Success** Target takes 1d6+3 mental damage and Aslynn's sharper eye gains temporary Hit Points equal to half the mental damage the target takes. If the target's Hit Points were lower than the damage dealt, the Aslynn's sharper eye gains temporary Hit Points equal to their remaining Hit Points instead.\n\n**Failure** As success, but target takes 3d6 mental damage and is [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] for 1 round.\n\n**Critical Failure** As success, but target takes 6d6 mental damage and is [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] for 1 minute."

  - name: "Mirror Travel"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (occult,teleportation) An Aslynn's sharper eye can crawl into any mirror within their reach as if it were a door or window, instantly transporting them as well as any items they're wearing and holding to another mirror within 500 feet. The Aslynn's sharper eye can remain within the mirror indefinitely or, provided they're using their Mirrored Transformation ability, they may choose to exit a mirror as part of any action they take with the Move trait. An Aslynn's sharper eye can't exit a mirror unless they're using their Mirrored Transformation ability to take a specific creature's form. An Aslynn's sharper eye can't exit a mirror that has the broken condition."

  - name: "Mirrored Transformation"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,occult,polymorph) An Aslynn's sharper eye takes the appearance of a mirrored version of any Large or smaller creature who they have seen and whose appearance they remember. While those who are not familiar with the subject of their mimicry may be fooled by the disguise, those who know the subject well automatically notice the mirroring effect. This ability doesn't change the Speed of the Aslynn's sharper eye or their attack and damage bonuses with its Strikes but might change the damage type their Strikes deal."

  - name: "Psychic Assault"
    desc: " (mental,occult) The Aslynn's sharper eye imbues their attacks with a psychic assault, infusing the mind of the creature struck with hideous nightmare visions and hallucinations. A creature damaged by the Aslynn's sharper eye's fist must succeed at a `DC 24 Fortitude check` save or be [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] for 1 round. On a critical failure, the target is dazzled for 1d4 rounds and [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] for 1 round."
