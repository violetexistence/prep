Variant efreeti

The efreet are hateful and merciless genies from the Plane of Fire, where they build metropolises and massive trade centers that draw extraplanar travelers from across the multiverse. They are cruel slavers, vengeful warmongers, and sinister wish-masters; there are many tales of mortals who made pacts with efreet only to have their words twisted to suit a genie's capricious and malevolent whims.

Efreet do not readily treat with other genies; they share an eternal feud with the djinn, disdain marids, regard jann as weaklings unworthy of the genie title, and only occasionally tolerate alliances with shaitans. At 12 feet tall and weighing 2,000 pounds, efreet are formidable opponents and cow their chosen victims with a glance.

* * *

A unique type of genie exists for each Elemental Plane, and the bodies of genies are formed out of elemental matter corresponding to their native plane: djinn are formed from wind, clouds, and storms; efreet are fire made flesh; marids are beings of water; and shaitans are composed of metal, gems, and stone. Lastly, the jann are formed out of all four elements, and are the weakest of geniekind.
