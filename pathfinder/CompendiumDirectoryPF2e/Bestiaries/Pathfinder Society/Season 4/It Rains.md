    desc: "`pf2:r` (water) **Trigger** A creature touches anything in the room without Fasiel's permission\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The trap rolls initiative. A wall of water blocks the exits while the trap is active, making a shove attack (1d20+19) toward the interior against any creature that moves into a doorway space."

  - name: "Routine"
    desc: "(1 action) The trap has one action per round by default, though it may gain more actions based on the encounter's scaling as listed in the sidebar. On each of the trap's actions, the amphora pours out water, increasing the depth of the water by 5 feet. Once the room is full of water, creatures in the room begin drowning, and the trap deals 2d8+7 bludgeoning damage with a `DC 22 Fortitude check` save to each creature in the room on its action as the water pressure increases."
  - name: "Reset"
    desc: "The trap deactivates and resets if 2 minutes pass without a creature inside the room."
