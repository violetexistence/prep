    desc: "`pf2:2`  Nathatel channels a spell into a melee attack to deliver a magically charged attack. He Casts a Spell that takes 1 or 2 actions to cast and requires a spell attack roll. The effects of the spell don't occur immediately but are imbued into his attack instead. He makes a melee Strike with a weapon or unarmed attack, which gains the arcane trait. His spell is coupled with the attack, using his attack roll to determine the effects of both the Strike and the spell. This counts as two attacks for his multiple attack penalty, but the penalty isn't applied until after he has completed the Spellstrike. After he uses Spellstrike, Nathatel can't do so again until he recharges this ability as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. He also recharges his Spellstrike when he casts [[Spells/Force Fang|Force Fang]] or [[Spells/Thunderous Strike|Thunderous Strike]]."
