Variant deathless acolyte

Deathless acolytes typically arise when a deity or their herald expends a minor amount of power to return a low-ranking priest. Some priests are powerful enough in life to return, greatly lessened, of their own volition.

* * *

Deathless acolytes are an oddity among undead, neither willingly transformed nor, strictly speaking, transformed against their will. The creation of a deathless acolyte is an act of direct intervention by a deity, typically as a double-edged reward and curse granted to a faithful priest who failed in completing a divine mandate due to circumstances beyond their control.
