    desc: "  A grave hag adds [[Spells/Harm|Harm]], [[Spells/Mimic Undead|Mimic Undead]], and the [[Spells/Call Spirit|Call Spirit]] ritual to her coven's spells.\n* * *\n\nThis monster can form a coven with two or more other creatures who also have the coven ability. This involves performing an 8-hour ceremony with all prospective coven members. After the coven is formed, each of its members gains elite adjustments, adjusting their levels accordingly. Coven members can sense other members' locations and conditions by spending a single action, which has the concentrate trait, and can sense what another coven member is sensing as a two-action activity, which has the concentrate trait as well.\n\nCovens also grant spells and rituals to their members, but these can be cast only in cooperation between three coven members who are all within 30 feet of one another. A coven member can contribute to a coven spell with a single action that has the concentrate trait. If two coven members have contributed these actions within the last round, a third member can cast a coven spell on her turn by spending the normal spellcasting actions. A coven can cast its coven spells an unlimited number of times but can cast only one coven spell each round. All covens grant the 8th-rank [[Spells/Cursed Metamorphosis|Cursed Metamorphosis]] spell and all the following spells, which the coven can cast at any rank up to 5th: [[Spells/Augury|Augury]], [[Spells/Charm|Charm]], [[Spells/Clairaudience|Clairaudience]], [[Spells/Clairvoyance|Clairvoyance]], [[Spells/Dream Message|Dream Message]], [[Spells/Illusory Disguise|Illusory Disguise]], [[Spells/Illusory Scene|Illusory Scene]], [[Spells/Scouting Eye|Scouting Eye]], and [[Spells/Talking Corpse|Talking Corpse]]. Individual creatures with the coven ability also grant additional spells to any coven they join. A coven can also cast the [[Spells/Control Weather|Control Weather]] ritual, with a DC of 23 instead of the standard DC.\n\nIf a coven member's departure or death brings the coven below three members, the remaining members keep their elite adjustments for 24 hours, but without enough members to contribute the necessary actions, they can't cast coven spells."

    desc: "`pf2:3` (curse,occult) The grave hag names a single creature within 30 feet; that creature must succeed at a `DC 30 Will check` save or be afflicted with a grave curse equal to the hag's level. The curse lasts until the hag chooses to end it or is slain, rather than by returning items. Regardless of the save result, the target is then temporarily immune to the hag's grave curse for 24 hours.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** You are hounded by undead creatures of the same level as the curse. Every night, you must attempt a `DC 15 Flat check` check. On a failure, an incorporeal undead manifests to hassle and harry you throughout the night, retreating before it can take much damage and often preventing you from gaining a full night's rest. Whenever you enter a graveyard or other area where bodies are buried, you must succeed at the same flat check or a body animates as a corporeal undead (typically a skeleton or zombie) to attack you.\n\nThese undead are temporary and exist only to harry you; if you take control of the undead, move on, or otherwise avoid their attacks, incorporeal undead discorporate and corporeal undead collapse into ordinary corpses. The curse can be removed by returning the stolen items to their resting place."

This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

Rot-skinned grave hags usually lair in cemeteries, mausoleums, and other burial sites; unlike most hags, they can't alter their appearance into a comely shape, so they hide from most observers. Grave hags consider such a predatory life hiding out in graveyards to be pitiful and squalid-they prefer to dwell in lands where necromancy is common and undeath isn't unusual. These grave hags become adept at necromantic magic and love posing as scholars. Schemers and plotters, they surround themselves with minions whom they send on missions to collect corpses for ghastly rituals.

* * *

Hags are surprisingly diverse, both in abilities and in their terrain.
