    desc: "`pf2:2`  The bugbear slasher makes a dazzling series of attacks with two weapons, using the first attack to throw their foe off guard against a second attack at a different angle. They make one Strike with each of their two melee weapons, both against the same target. The target is automatically [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] against the second attack. Apply the bugbear slasher's multiple attack penalty to the Strikes normally."

Variant Bugbear Tormentor

These stealthy and cruel goblinoid creatures delight in spreading fear and tormenting their victims. Bugbears are the monsters lurking in the closet and hiding under the bed. Preying on remote farmsteads, bugbears reveal their presence with thumps in the night or creaks of boards to build lurking dread and arouse suspicion and fear.
