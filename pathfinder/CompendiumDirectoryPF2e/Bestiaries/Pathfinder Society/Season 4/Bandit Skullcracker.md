Variant Bandit

By setting ambushes and traps in concealing countryside, such as forests and mountains, bandits waylay travelers and plunder their valuables before disappearing back to their wilderness hideouts. Many bandits seek only to steal and release their victims alive, though a few prefer to leave no witnesses.

Some criminals are the desperate who have no option but to break the law to survive, while others choose a life of crime for thrills, forming gangs or underworld guilds that specialize in certain illegal ventures.
