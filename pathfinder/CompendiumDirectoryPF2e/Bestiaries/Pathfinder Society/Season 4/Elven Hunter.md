Variant hunter

As is reflected in the many depictions of an elk-headed Erastil, god of the hunt, the hunter is very much a creature of the forest, known by the forest and familiar with every aspect of it. After all, the final determination of who is the hunter and who is prey often depends on who is able to make an ally of the terrain.

From the managed and cultivated forests that support villages to the tree-covered crown lands where only nobles and their servants are permitted to hunt, forests provide. To communities, forests provide fuel, food, medicine, and raw materials, while royally protected forests provide food for the nobles' table and a source of entertainment in the form of organized hunts. Even the ancient woods untouched by mortal hand or blade provide bards with settings where legends happened and could happen again. Many find the forest depths unsettling, but others live their lives among the trees and alongside the creatures that make their homes there.
