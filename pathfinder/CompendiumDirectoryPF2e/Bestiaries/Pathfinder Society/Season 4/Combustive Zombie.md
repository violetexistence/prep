Variant sulfur zombie

Glowing with a dull amber light, these odious creatures spawn from a combination of necromancy and fire. These destructive creations sow chaos and demolish fortifications, making them the bane of besieged cities.

Necromancers most often create these mindless undead as obedient, expendable servitors. Left to its own devices, a zombie seeks only to consume the living, stopping only when its rotting body can no longer hold together.
