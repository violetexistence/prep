Much larger and more foul-tempered than their common cousins, dire wolves haunt primeval lands that accommodate their massive size and proportionately large hunting grounds and appetites. Orcs are fond of using dire wolves as mounts, finding their vicious tempers perfect for hunting and warfare.

Wolves roam forests, hills, and other wild lands, where they hunt in packs to beleaguer and surround their prey before going in for the kill. Like most predatory animals, wolves prefer to attack the weakest or most vulnerable prey they can find.
