  - name: "Wear Pelt"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (divine,manipulate) Serraleth dons the pelt of an adjacent dead animal, transforming into its lookalike. She becomes the same size and gains the same Speeds as the target animal. Serraleth loses her claw and jaws unarmed Strikes and gains the types of melee Strikes of the animal whose pelt she wears. The Strike deals damage equal to her jaws Strike or, if the Strike has the agile trait, her claw Strike. Either way, the damage type changes to match the new unarmed attack. While Serraleth wears a pelt, half of physical damage dealt to her is instead dealt to the pelt. A pelt has Hardness 5 and 25 HP. When a pelt reaches 0 HP, she's immediately expelled from the pelt and it's destroyed."

Female roru demon

Rorus, sometimes called hunter demons, are brutal fiends that arise from the souls of mortals who mutilated animal corpses. As demons, these individuals don animal pelts, then infiltrate packs or herds to corrupt entire swaths of animals, turning their victims bloodthirsty and feral.
