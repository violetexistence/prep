Variant hunter wight

Dangers deep in the wilderness claim the life some lone scout or hunter. When they arise as wights, they renew their hunt with equal vigor, but all the living are now their prey. Hunter wights prefer to seek strategic ground, frequently taking residence atop hills or within abandoned watchtowers and keeps.

Wights are undead beings of spite who primarily stalk places related to death.
