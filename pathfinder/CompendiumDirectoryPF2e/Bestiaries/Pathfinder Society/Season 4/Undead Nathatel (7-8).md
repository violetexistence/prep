    desc: "  This monster regains the listed number of Hit Points each round at the beginning of its turn. Its [[Conditions/Dying|Dying]] condition never increases beyond Dying 3 as long as its regeneration is active. However, if it takes damage of a type listed in the regeneration entry, its regeneration deactivates until the end of its next turn. Deactivate the regeneration before applying any damage of a listed type, since that damage might kill the monster by bringing it to Dying 4."

    desc: "`pf2:r`  **Trigger** A creature Casts a Spell on Nathatel, and he either succeeds at its saving throw versus the spell or the caster fails the spell attack roll against him\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The caster of the triggering spell undergoes a wellspring surge; roll randomly on the table below. This table is a slight variant of the standard table ([[Rollable Tables/Wellspring Surges|Wellspring Surges]]), adjusted to streamline play. The spell rank of the surge is the rank of the spell that triggered this reaction.\n* * *\n\n  \n\n| d20 | Effect |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1 | Energy Unleashed (evocation) Raw energy deals 2d6 damage per spell rank of the surge (DC 25 basic Reflex save) to the caster and all creatures in a 10-foot burst. |\n| 2 | Vitality Energy Expulsion (healing, necromancy, vitality) Vitality energy explodes outward from the caster, affecting them and all creatures in a 20-foot burst. Living creatures heal for 1d8 Hit Points per spell rank of the surge. Undead creatures instead take the same amount of vitality damage, with a basic DC 25 Will save. |\n| 3 | Mass Siphon (transmutation) Creatures and objects within a 30- foot emanation around the caster become nearly weightless until the end of the caster's next turn. Nearly weightless creatures can Climb at their land Speed and can Leap as far upward as they could normally Leap horizontally. |\n| 4 | Monstrous Transformation (mental, morph, transmutation) The caster's head and arms transform into an exaggerated imitation of a creature connected to their magic for 1 minute. The caster gains a status bonus to weapon and unarmed damage rolls equal to the spell rank. At the start of each of the caster's turns while they are transformed, they must succeed at DC 25 Will save or be confused until the start of your next turn. On a critical success, the caster can choose to end the effect entirely, also losing the status bonus. |\n| 5 | Sudden Gale (air, evocation) Weather in a 40-foot emanation surrounding the caster is disturbed. Strong winds blow in a random direction for 1 minute. Each creature that starts its turn in the area must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or fall prone (and be pushed 10 feet on a critical failure), and you must succeed at this save immediately after the surge. Any movement against the wind is difficult terrain, or greater difficult terrain while flying. |\n| 6 | Tremor (earth, evocation) The earth trembles in a 40-foot emanation surrounding the caster. Each creature on a surface must immediately succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or fall prone. The surface then becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute. |\n| 7 | Oppressive Voice (divination, mental, nonlethal) The voice of the caster's muse, deity, ancestor, or another appropriate entity suddenly overwhelms their mind. The caster takes 1d4 mental damage per spell rank (basic DC 25 Will save). On a failure, they are also stunned 1 (stunned 2 on a critical failure). |\n| 8 | Trinket Squall (illusion) Visual illusions of objects related to the caster's magic fall like rain throughout a 40-foot burst for 1 minute, giving concealment in the area. Creatures can attempt to disbelieve this illusion, with a Perception DC of 25 (Core Rulebook 298). |\n| 9 | Antimagic Eruption (abjuration) The surge attempts to counteract a random spell active on the caster and on each creature within a 10-foot burst of them (counteract rank 4, counteract modifier +17). |\n| 10 | Mental Broadcast (detection, divination, mental) For 1 minute, everyone within 30 feet of the caster can hear the caster's surface thoughts. |\n| 11 | Verdant Clutch (conjuration, plant) Plants and vines grow from all surfaces within 20 feet of the caster causing all creatures in the area to be immobilized unless they succeed at a DC 25 Reflex save. The Escape DC is 25 ([[Actions/escape dc=25\\|escape dc=25]]). |\n| 12 | Tinge of Terror (emotion, enchantment, fear, mental) The caster and all creatures within 20 feet of them are affected by powerful fright. They must attempt a DC 25 Will save, becoming frightened |\n| 1 | on a failure or frightened 2 on a critical failure. |\n| 13 | Strike up the Band (auditory, illusion) For 1 minute, the caster is followed by orchestral theme music tied to the emotional content of the actions they are performing. This grants them a +2 status bonus to Diplomacy, Intimidation, and Performance checks, a –2 status penalty to Deception checks, and makes certain uses of Stealth virtually impossible. It might have other effects as the GM sees fit. |\n| 14 | Life Sap (necromancy) The surge drains the caster's life force and strength. They become drained 1 and doomed 1, and they are enfeebled 2 for 1 minute. |\n| 15 | Ablative Barrier (abjuration) Energy forms a protective barrier that ablates slowly as creatures in the area take damage. The caster and all creatures in a 40-foot burst around the caster gain resistance to all damage equal to double the surge's spell rank for up to 1 minute. Whenever a creature applies this resistance, the resistance for all affected creatures reduces by 1. The effect ends for all creatures when it reduces to 0. |\n| 16 | Luminous Pests (illusion, visual) Numerous tiny flying reatures formed of bright colorful light, such as bats or hummingbirds, emerge from the caster, flying in a 30-foot cone. The caster chooses the cone's direction. The caster and all creatures in the cone must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or be dazzled for 1 minute, or blinded for 1 round and then dazzled for 1 minute on a critical failure. |\n| 17 | Emotional Turmoil (emotion, enchantment, mental) A swirl of conflicting emotions overwhelm the caster from the surging magic. For 1 minute, the caster must attempt a DC 11 flat check at the start of each of their turns. On a success, they gain a +2 status bonus to all attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks for 1 round; on a failure, they take a –2 status penalty to them instead. |\n| 18 | Sudden Downpour (evocation, water) Water cascades from above, putting out non-magical fires in a 10-foot burst around the caster and attempting to counteract magical fires (counteract rank 4, counteract modifier +17). |\n| 19 | Spell Surge The caster immediately casts one spell in their repertoire of the surge's spell rank or lower (or from their prepared spells or innate spells if they have a repertoire). They must choose a spell that takes 3 or fewer actions to cast. |\n| 20 | Double Surge The surge has two different effects. Roll twice and apply both effects, rerolling any 20s. |"

Male variant spellscar fext

Spellscar fexts are spellcasters who were destroyed by wild magic or wellspring surges they tried—and failed—to control. The magical feedback that snuffed out their life warped and animated their flesh, twisting them into shambling undead. Spellscar fexts stand 6 feet tall with disproportionately long arms that end in clusters of waving magical tendrils.

Almost all who became spellscar fexts entered the Mana Wastes to harness the power of the area's wild magic. Once transformed, the desire for magical power becomes a spellscar fext's singular motivation. The creatures focus their attacks on magic users they encounter, attempting to kill them and strip their magic. Unfortunately for a spellscar fext, their transformation makes their entire being inimical to magic. They're unable to cast even the simplest of spells. They grasp destructively at magic they can never hold.

Difficult for the unprepared to destroy permanently, spellscar fexts harry trade routes known for shipping magical goods and repeatedly attack arcane workshops on the borders of the Mana Wastes. They're particularly dangerous to spellcasters traveling alone, as battling the creatures might trigger a wellspring surge that could destroy the lone magic user.

As the fext's vulnerability to glass weapons has become more well known, enterprising gunsmiths in Alkenstar have begun crafting glass ammunition, an uncommon item that costs the same as cold iron ammunition.
