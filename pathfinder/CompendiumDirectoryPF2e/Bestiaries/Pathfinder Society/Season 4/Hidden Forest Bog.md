    desc: "(one action) On its initiative, the bog pulls down each creature within it. A creature that was submerged to its waist becomes submerged to its neck, and a creature that was submerged up to its neck is pulled under and must hold its breath to avoid suffocation.\n\nA creature partially or fully submerged in the bog can attempt a `DC 16 Athletics check` check to Swim to either raise itself by one step (pulled under to submerged to its neck, or submerged to its neck to submerged to its waist), or to escape from the bog if it's submerged only up to its waist. This DC increases to `DC 18 Athletics check` for creatures submerged up to their neck or worse. On a critical failure, the creature is pulled down one step. Other creatures can [[Actions/Aid|Aid]], typically by using a rope or similar assistance (providing an automatic success), or attempt to pull a single affected creature out with their own Athletics check, with the same results as if the aiding creature attempted the check itself."
