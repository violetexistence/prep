    desc: "The hazard gains a number of actions equal to the number of PCs; it loses 1 action each round for each facet that has been disabled. Each claw tears at a different PC, who takes 2d10 + 9 mental damage (basic `DC 27 Will check` save). On a failure, they are [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] by the claw ([[Actions/Escape|Escape]] DC 25). On a critical failure, or on a failure if they are already grabbed, they have their soul ripped from their body, which falls [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]]. Each round on their turn, the soul can attempt a `DC 25 Intimidation check`, `DC 25 Occultism check`, or `DC 25 Survival check` check to fortify itself and return to its body as a three-action activity. The possible outcomes are as follows.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The soul returns to their body, which loses the unconscious condition.\n\n**Success** The soul returns to their body, which loses the unconscious condition, but gains the grabbed condition.\n\n**Failure** The soul makes no progress toward escape.\n\n**Critical Failure** The soul makes no progress toward escape and the target takes 2d10 + 9 mental damage until they are reduced to 0 Hit Points, after which they remain in captivity until the trap is defeated.\n* * *\n\nEach claw focuses on its target until the target is reduced to 0 Hit Points, after which it takes no action on its turn unless another facet is disabled or its target regains Hit Points."
