Variant giant skunk

With their distinctive black bodies and white stripes or spots, skunks are instantly recognizable to most creatures. Those who catch a full blast of musk rarely decide to trouble a skunk again, as the revolting stench can linger for hours or even days. Removing the odor is difficult, typically requiring the aid of alchemy or magic.

* * *

Giant skunks thrive in places where their larger size and more potent musk allow them to fend off predators their smaller cousins can't. With larger bodies come more powerful appetites, and giant skunks tend to be aggressive and territorial.
