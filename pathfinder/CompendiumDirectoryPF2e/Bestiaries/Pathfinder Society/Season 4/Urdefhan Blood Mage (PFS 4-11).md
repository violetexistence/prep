If the jaws Strike was a critical hit, the creature suffers both effects, using the same save result for both.\n\n*   **Drain Blood** `DC 26 Fortitude check` The urdefhan drinks some of the creature's blood. On a failed save, the creature is [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]] and the urdefhan regains 10 healing HP (or, on a critical failure, it's [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 2]] and the urdefhan regains 20 healing HP).\n*   **Drain Vitality** (necromancy) `DC 26 Fortitude check` The urdefhan draws out some of the creature's vital essence. The creature becomes [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]] for 1 hour on a failed save (or [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 2]] for 1 hour on a critical failure)."

Hardened masters of occult power, urdefhan blood mages trade their blood for magical might. A heavily scarred blood mage is held in esteem by their fellow urdefhans, as it shows they have survived many bargains with eerie occult patrons.

Translucent-skinned scourges of the Darklands, urdefhans are remorseless killers and foot soldiers of the world's end.
