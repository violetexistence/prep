    desc: "`pf2:r` (poison) **Trigger** A creature moves into the flowers' space.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The pollen in the suncatcher blooms puffs out in a 5-foot burst. All creatures in the area must each attempt a `DC 21 Fortitude check` save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected and is immune to the effects of suncatcher bloom pollen for 24 hours.\n\n**Success** The creature is [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] for 1 minute.\n\n**Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] for 1 hour and immediately falls unconscious. They do not fall prone or release what they are holding, and they can still wake up normally with a successful Perception check. If they are still unconscious after 1 minute they wake up automatically.\n\n**Critical Failure** Same as failure, except the creature wakes up automatically after 1 hour instead of after 1 minute."
