    desc: "The grove, broken and tormented due to the necromantic energy infecting the area it protected, manifests an illusion to warn others of the region's plight and plead for help. Pharasmin cleric and Pathfinder Seldrick Dralston trudges into the grove, injured and infected with some kind of evil corruption. He defiles the statue of Erastil in the center of the grove, and the golden light illuminating the grove ceases, revealing the black skies above. Purple magical energy emanating from a nearby tower seeps into the sacred grove, and the life within the grove's protection begins to die."

  - name: "Vision of Desecration"
    desc: "`pf2:r` (emotion, fear, mental, occult) **Trigger** At least 2 creatures step into the circle of trees\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The haunted grove creates a vision steeped in its despair to tell the tale of a cleric of Pharasma's fall to undead corruption and his subsequent desecration of the holy shrine, allowing necromantic energies to infest the grove. All creatures within the circle of trees must attempt a `DC 22 Will check` save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature sees through the illusions entirely and is temporarily immune to the haunt for 1 hour.\n\n**Success** The creature is unaffected by the strange images.\n\n**Failure** The creature experiences a phantom pain from the Sacred Grove as it had suffered in the moment of Seldrick's fall. The haunt deals 4d6 mental damage.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature is left with a lingering suspicion of others and can't benefit from Aid reactions for 24 hours."

    desc: "The haunt returns every 10 minutes to retell its tale. The haunting of the sacred grove is permanently put to rest if the shrine is reconsecrated, which is impossible unless the evil forces in the nearby watchtower are defeated."
