Roiling about in seething waves of bleached death, clacking skull swarms arise from the remains of dozens of beheaded humanoids. The horrible clattering of the skulls' onslaught drives their prey to distraction even while they try to flee in terror.

A skull swarm is composed of reanimated masses of craniums and jawbones, forming a terrifying avalanche of undead fury. Most skull swarms are mindless, though some retain a vestige of wit, awareness, and even magical talents from life, culminating in a highly intelligent swarm mind.
