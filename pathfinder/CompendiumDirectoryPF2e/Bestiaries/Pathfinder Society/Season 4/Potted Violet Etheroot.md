    desc: " (emotion,mental) The potted violet etheroot can sense the emotions of creatures within 120 feet as an imprecise sense. Emotion sense is a precise sense against creatures under an emotion effect. A creature under the effects of [[Spells/Calm|Calm]] or the serenity effect of the etheroot's Incite Emotion ability can't be noticed via emotion sense."

  - name: "Soulfired Pot"
    desc: "  The potted violet etheroot is rooted in a soulfired pot, which was glazed within a hellish kiln and which, like normal objects, has Hardness and grants the etheroot resistance to fire. This Hardness reduces any damage the etheroot takes by an amount equal to the Hardness. Once the potted violet etheroot is reduced to less than half its Hit Points, or immediately upon being damaged by a critical hit, its soulfired pot breaks, it loses its resistance to fire, and its AC is reduced to 23. Breaking the pot also increases the etheroot's speed to 25 feet."

  - name: "Tentacle Flurry"
