    desc: "(3 actions) The hazard regenerates any pies that it has thrown at a cost of one action per pie (to a maximum of 3 active pies). Each successful check to disable the hazard deactivates one of the pies, reducing the number of active pies by 1. After regenerating pies on its turn, the hazard throws pies whenever a creature triggers continually sur-piesed. For each pie Strike, roll 1d4. On a 1, the pie pan has nails driven into it by Numblekin and deals an additional 1d10+6 piercing damage. The nails make the pie's damage lethal, rather than nonlethal."
