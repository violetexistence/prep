If the Strike was a critical success, the target is also [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]]. When a creature Escapes (DC 17), or if the Strike misses, the net crumbles into nothing. Each time a creature attempts to [[Actions/Escape|Escape]], it takes 1d6 slashing damage from the net's barbs, regardless of whether the attempt succeeds.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Barbed Net|Effect: Barbed Net]]"
