  - name: "Cute But Deadly"
    desc: " (aura,visual) 30 feet. The sight of these bunnies with their red glowing eyes and sharp teeth is so unsettling that upon seeing them a creature must attempt a `DC 22 Will check` save. On a failure, that creature becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]] (or [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] on a critical failure) and cannot lower their frightened condition lower than 1 while within the aura. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune to all abyssal bunny swarm's cute but deadly auras for 1 minute."
