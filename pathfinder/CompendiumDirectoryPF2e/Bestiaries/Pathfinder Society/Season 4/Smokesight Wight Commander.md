This spawn is under the command of the wight commander that killed them. They don't have drain life or spawn wight soldier and are [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 2]] for as long as they're a wight spawn. If the creator of the wight spawn dies, the wight spawn becomes a fully autonomous wight; they regain their free will, gain drain life and spawn wight soldier, and are no longer clumsy."

When the beloved leader of a military unit is raised as a wight, sometimes the spirits of their comrades return with them, creating a gestalt being of impeccable tactical acumen.
