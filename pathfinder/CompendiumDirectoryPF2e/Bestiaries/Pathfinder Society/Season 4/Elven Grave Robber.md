Variant grave robber

Many cultures have a tradition of burying their dead with a selection of the deceased's most precious possessions, and some include gifts that are thought to provide a boon in the afterlife. Such valuables can be easy pickings for those with no respect for-or fear of-the dead.

Some criminals are the desperate who have no option but to break the law to survive, while others choose a life of crime for thrills, forming gangs or underworld guilds that specialize in certain illegal ventures.
