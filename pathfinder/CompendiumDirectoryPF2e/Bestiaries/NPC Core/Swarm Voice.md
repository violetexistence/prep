An enemy takes a â€“2 circumstance penalty to its save if it's adjacent to one or more ratfolk allied with the swarm voice. Regardless of the result of a creature's save, it's then temporarily immune for 1 hour."

The swarm voice is the secular leader of a ysoki warren or one family in a larger warren. If there is a dispute, the swarm voice resolves it. If there is a negotiation, they orchestrate it. If war is about to break out, they declare it. The swarm voice is the welcoming hand and the iron fist of their colony.

Ysoki (or, as outsiders call them, ratfolk) in their warrens have a society that is both stern and democratic, caring and ever vigilant. And at the top is a handful of intimidating and protective figures who make sure the swarm remains safe.
