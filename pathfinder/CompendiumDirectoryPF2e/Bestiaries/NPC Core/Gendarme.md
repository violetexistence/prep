Powerful governments retain gendarmes to guard important magistrates, enforce laws protecting national security, reinstate order amid unrest, and capture unusually dangerous criminals. They're also sent to deal with important cases in rural areas without substantial guards of their own.

Larger societies rely on those with the authority and the ability to interpret and enforce laws. Some carry out these duties fairly, but others are harsh and cruel, imposing severe punishments on anyone unable to pay for clemency.
