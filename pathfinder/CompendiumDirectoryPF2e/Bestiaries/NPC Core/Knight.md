Elite fighters from the lowest ranks of nobility, knights are proud champions of their court. Unlike other nobles, knights must earn their title through loyalty and strength-of-arms rather than inheritance. Ideals such as chivalry, honor, and virtue are associated with knights but not all meet such romantic standards.

The denizens of a noble court are the most powerful people in a civilization, primed with wealth, station, and authority above the common people.
