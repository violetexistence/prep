Gamekeepers live on the outskirts of the hold, usually remaining solitary and tending to animals they've captured. Every part of a trapped animal can be useful for making supplies or trading.

Orcs have a strict moral code encompassing valor and accomplishment, and they cast out those unwilling to follow it. For the last few generations, orcs have been trying to erase the narratives around their culture as being solely focused on war and violence. They invite other races and adventuring parties inside their holds so they may experience the truth of who the orcs are.
