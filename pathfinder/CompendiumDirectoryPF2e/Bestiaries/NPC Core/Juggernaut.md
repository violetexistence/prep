    desc: "  A juggernaut's armor includes one integrated melee weapon, such as a diamond-tipped rotary saw blade, massive pneumatic drill, or heavy spiked gauntlet. The specifics don't change the damage dealt by its Strikes, but determines whether it deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. A juggernaut with tools and a workshop can spend 2 hours to swap their armor's integrated weapon."

  - name: "Power Source"
    desc: "  Juggernaut armor requires a power source built into the armor—such as a steam boiler, Stasian coil, or alchemical reservoir. This determines a damage type—cold, electricity, fire, or poison—for certain abilities."

    desc: "`pf2:1` (alchemical) The juggernaut gains a Fly speed of 15 feet until the end of their current turn. If the juggernaut isn't on solid ground when they lose their fly Speed, they fall. After the effect ends, the juggernaut can't use Jump Jets again for 1 round."

The monster can attempt to Trample the same creature only once in a single use of Trample.

The heavy suit of mechanical metal armor a juggernaut wears is custom-built and highly complex and specialized to its wearer. Other creatures can't make use of the armor unless they have similar skill and customize it thoroughly.

Although relatively uncommon across much of Golarion, the frequently eccentric but undeniably brilliant minds who create elaborate devices of clockwork, gunpowder, and steam often loom much larger in the public eye than their numbers would suggest.
