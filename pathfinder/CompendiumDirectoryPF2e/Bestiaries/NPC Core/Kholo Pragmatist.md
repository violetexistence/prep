Due to their aggressive lifestyle, kholo warriors rarely live to an old age. When a kholo pragmatist enters a fight, they would prefer to see another battle, so they use any possible advantage they can get to survive. They keep foes at a distance with their longspears have developed techniques to better block attacks with the weapon. If the tide of battle turns against them, kholo pragmatists will run or surrender if it's the most practical option.

These pragmatic hunters have earned a very poor reputation for their brutality in battle and worship of demons. While many kholos live up to the terrible stories of their ferocity and cannibalism, others are scavengers and trappers just trying to get by. Many of their cultural traditions are misunderstood by other ancestries, and some kholos play into the fear provoked in those who believe the twisted tales about their people. Kholos are often criticized for their lack of honor in battle, but a kholo understands honor doesn't bring you back home alive, nor does honor put food on the table. Ambushes, feints, and deceptions that lead to fewer kholo deaths and a quicker victory are simply the logical thing to do.
