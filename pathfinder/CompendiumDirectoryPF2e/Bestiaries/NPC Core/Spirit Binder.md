    desc: " (detection,occult) The spirit binder can sense the spirits of creatures, including living creatures, most non-mindless undead, and haunts within the listed range. Since spiritsense detects spiritual essence, not physical bodies, it can detect spirits projected by spells (such as [[Spells/Project Image|Project Image]]) or possessing otherwise soulless objects. It can't detect soulless bodies, constructs, or objects, and like most senses, it doesn't penetrate through solid objects."

Hidden secrets and occult powers have an irresistible lure for many. Since the majority of these NPCs are spellcasters, consider using alternative spell lists to adjust their themes.
