Those who have unlocked the secrets of opening a kinetic gate to an elemental plane within themselves wield immense power over that element. Practitioners who specialize in elemental earth are hardy and defense-minded. The mountain guardian is surrounded by heavy armor made of stone held together with elemental magic.

A primalist is a wielder of primal energies and magic, sometimes taught by forces of primal power, including powerful elementals or fey of the First World. Primalists protect the natural world, offering strong medicine to those in need while facing suspicion from those who don't understand their ways.

A great many primalists belong to druidic circles, and even those who aren't members tend to be familiar with the most prominent ones in their homeland.
