A creature that critically fails is also [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] for 1 minute. Each creature is then temporarily immune for 1 minute."

Forlorn elves, who spend their lives among shorter-lived peoples, often grow morose from constant loss. Some channel this melancholy into their art.

Elves' long lives give them centuries to delve into studies, artistry, or exploration.
