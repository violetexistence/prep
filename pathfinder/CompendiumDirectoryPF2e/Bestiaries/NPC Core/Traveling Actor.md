The life of a traveling actor is, contrary to belief, not one of glamor but effort. To be on the road going from town to town wearing a thousand faces invites little reward, save the adoration of the crowd. Even so, this is where they thrive. Actors typically travel in troupes, composed not only of other actors but also of stagehands, drivers, and assorted hangers-on. All of them fall under the thumb of a singular director, acting as both parent and manager to all within the troupe.

Performances come in a wide variety of forms, from musical methods like singing and instruments to physical dancing and juggling to simple orating and conversing.
