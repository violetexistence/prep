    desc: "`pf2:3` (manipulate) The kobold trapper creates a rudimentary trap on a surface in an adjacent square. The trap activates the next time a creature moves adjacent to it. The creature takes 2d6 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (determined by the trapper when the trap is constructed) with a `DC 18 Reflex check` save. On a failure, the creature also takes a â€“5 status penalty to all Speeds for 1 minute. The trap is destroyed when activated or after 8 hours, whichever comes first. A trapper typically carries enough raw materials to make six traps each day.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Construct Trap|Effect: Construct Trap]]"

Kobolds are skillful artisans, always inventing new traps and snares to defend their territory and ambush enemies. Kobold trappers enjoy showing off their crafting prowess on the battlefield.

* * *

Kobolds are drawn to beings and objects of power, establishing their communities near them. Once a warren has been formed, the resident kobolds construct traps and set up ambushes to deter interlopers.
