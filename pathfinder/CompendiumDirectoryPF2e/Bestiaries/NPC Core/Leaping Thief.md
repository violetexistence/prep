Some catfolk take advantage of their natural agility to steal from those too slow to catch them. They usually target notorious misers and others who obviously have money to spareâ€”sometimes to help the needy, sometimes for simple profit.

Catfolk can be found traveling almost anywhere, and they are quick to settle down for a chat when they encounter fellow travelers. Some trade stories, act as guides, or operate at the fringes of polite society.
