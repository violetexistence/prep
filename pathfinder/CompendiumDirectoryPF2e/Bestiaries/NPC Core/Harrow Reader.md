A harrow deck is a set of 54 cards with symbolic illustrations that serves as a sacred divining tool. Feared by the superstitious and avoided by those who know better than to tempt fate, many harrow readers live and work in traveling communities, often moving from town to town as opportunities arise.

Hidden secrets and occult powers have an irresistible lure for many. Since the majority of these NPCs are spellcasters, consider using alternative spell lists to adjust their themes.
