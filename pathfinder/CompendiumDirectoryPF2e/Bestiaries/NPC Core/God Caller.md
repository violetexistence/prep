The god caller doesn't need to expend a spell slot, and can choose 2nd or 4th rank.\n*   **Tandem Strike** `pf2:2` The god caller makes a Strike and their eidolon can Strike as a reaction.

The summoners called god callers have a magical link to eidolons, revered as gods by the people of Sarkoris. Though this NPC is based on Sarkorian god callers, they can be adapted to different types of summoners by changing out the eidolon for another creature and making thematic tweaks to skills and spells.

Hidden secrets and occult powers have an irresistible lure for many. Since the majority of these NPCs are spellcasters, consider using alternative spell lists to adjust their themes.

## God Callers and the Divine

Some spirits called by god callers of Sarkoris are divine beings capable of granting spells. Consider granting a god caller NPC a cleric focus spell appropriate to one of the god's domains if they worship such a deity (using the same DC and spell attack as their primal spells). For instance, the Stag Mother of the Forest of Stones might grant the savor the sting domain spell from the pain domain.
