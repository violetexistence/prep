Primal spellcasters with a particular affinity for animals often aid their community by training and healing their domesticated animals. Others focus their time on preserving endangered species and helping them propagate or adapt to a changing environment. The pack leader is most often paired with the [[NPC Core/Trained Bat|Trained Bat]] companion.

A primalist is a wielder of primal energies and magic, sometimes taught by forces of primal power, including powerful elementals or fey of the First World. Primalists protect the natural world, offering strong medicine to those in need while facing suspicion from those who don't understand their ways.

A great many primalists belong to druidic circles, and even those who aren't members tend to be familiar with the most prominent ones in their homeland.
