Equestrian constables patrol for criminals on horseback in wealthy areas or serve as reeves to enforce court orders. Some patrol major roads far from the protection of the city guard.

Larger societies rely on those with the authority and the ability to interpret and enforce laws. Some carry out these duties fairly, but others are harsh and cruel, imposing severe punishments on anyone unable to pay for clemency.
