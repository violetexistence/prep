Few are as prepared to be unprepared as a gadgeteer, who are masters at building seemingly impossible creations out of almost anything. They're always useful to have when a plan inevitably goes wrong because they can quickly craft the perfect tool needed to get out of even the stickiest predicament. Every now and again, someone tries to hire a gadgeteer to perfect a single design to replicate it and make more permanent versions of their thrown-together gadgets. This effort is often in vain, as even the most talented gadgeteers are unlikely to perfectly replicate a design they made in the moment, even with the same materials. In fact, when put on the spot, they will likely create a functional gadget differently every time, even if they have access to the same material. This process makes duplication nearly impossible.

Although relatively uncommon across much of Golarion, the frequently eccentric but undeniably brilliant minds who create elaborate devices of clockwork, gunpowder, and steam often loom much larger in the public eye than their numbers would suggest.
