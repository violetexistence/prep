Trusted counselors of the court, advisors whisper words of guidance into the ears of those in power. Many nobles lean so heavily on their advisor's counsel that they make few decisions without them and insist on their attendance at all meetings and public events. Advisors are often master manipulators.

The denizens of a noble court are the most powerful people in a civilization, primed with wealth, station, and authority above the common people.
