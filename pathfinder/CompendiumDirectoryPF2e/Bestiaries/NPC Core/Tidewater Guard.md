Iruxi tidewater guards are capable fighters skilled at amphibious attacks and overpowering vessels along any shore. Because lizardfolk settlements are typically constructed partially underwater and partially above, they have need of defenders who can guard from attacks in both environments.

The special spaulders tidewater guards wear set them apart from other lizardfolk warriors. These protect their shoulders from cutlass and axe strikes, and might be constructed of dragon scales, turtle or giant chiton shells, lacquered wood, or even sea urchin tests. The recipe for the special resin iruxi armorers apply to harden these spaulders is a closely guarded secret, and each iruxi community's supply of the resin is small, precious, and closely guarded.

Lizardfolk culture has flowered in recent years. With that revival has come a new generation of iruxis (as they call themselves) more willing to engage with the wider world, bringing with them their society's reverence for the past, facility with nature, and willingness to defend itself.
