The innate gnomish inclination to revel in new experiences leads gnome philomaths to delve as deeply as they can into the multitudes of knowledge contained within a library. These shrewd observers have encyclopedic memories and tend to surround themselves with piles of documents and trinkets pertaining to whatever subject currently holds their attention. As their interests branch from one topic to the next, a gnome philomath files away their discoveries to be referenced again another day.

Because their ancestors came from the First World, gnomes are intrinsically linked to the realm of the fey and crave the mystical and unpredictable. They seek to create daring works of art, voyage to new places, and have experiences they've never had before. Otherwise, they could fall victim to the terrible gnomish illness known as the Bleaching, which not only drains them of their color but of their spirits as well.
