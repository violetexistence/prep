Within a troop, the standard bearer is a beacon of morale, cohesion, and camaraderie. They proudly wave the flag of the entity they fight for. Whether they lead the spearhead or provide support from the back lines, their presence alone is usually enough to rally the soldiers around them to continue fighting.
