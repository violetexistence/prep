However, the dynamo becomes [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] and can't use the Climb, [[Actions/Leap|Leap]], Swim, or [[Actions/Tumble Through|Tumble Through]] actions.

  - name: "Modular Prostheses"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  The dynamo configures one or both of their mechanical prosthetic hands into a specific configuration. Each configuration deals a specific damage type and has its own weapon traits: fist (bludgeoning; free-hand), gaff hook (piercing; grapple), impact driver (bludgeoning; shove), or spinning blade (slashing; trip). The dynamo can alternatively transform a hand into a steel shield with Hardness 8, HP 72, and BT 36. A broken prosthesis can't be reconfigured until repaired."

The intricate clockwork prostheses known as sterling dynamos have become increasingly common in recent years, particularly in havens of technological progress like Dongun Hold and the city of Absalom, but a few specialized engineers have elevated their dedication to research and development of such devices to an entirely new level. These individuals seek to achieve bodily perfection through augmentation, replacing their own limbs with advanced and sometimes untested prototypes that grant them a wide variety of abilities.

Although relatively uncommon across much of Golarion, the frequently eccentric but undeniably brilliant minds who create elaborate devices of clockwork, gunpowder, and steam often loom much larger in the public eye than their numbers would suggest.
