Largely due to an ancestral grudge against all things elven, many hobgoblins have an inherent distrust for magic, particularly the "elf magic" of the arcane tradition. Most hobgoblin armies maintain a contingent of special "spellbreaker" forces trained to assassinate high-value spellcasting targets prior to military engagement or quickly identify and terminate enemy battle mages.

Hobgoblins are respected across Golarion for their unmatched expertise in the art of war. The recent foundation of the hobgoblin nation of Oprak and its unprecedented acts of diplomacy, including non-aggression pacts with the neighboring nations of Nidal and Nirmathas, has given some hope that a lasting peace might finally be established; however, there remains no shortage of unaffiliated hobgoblin raiders and pillagers.
