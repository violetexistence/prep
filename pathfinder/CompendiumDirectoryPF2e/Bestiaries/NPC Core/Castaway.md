Treat this as a snare with a `DC 19 Perception check` check to spot, and a `DC 23 Thievery check` check to disable. It occupies a single 5-foot square and lasts 24 hours before falling apart. The first creature that enters the space takes 6d6 bludgeoning damage (`DC 22 Reflex check` save)."

Be it the result of shipwreck, forcible marooning, or personal choice, surviving alone on an island long enough tends to weed out the weak of body and mind. Lack of social interaction tends to breed belligerence towards outsiders, but hostilities are not a certainty.

Adventurers may need passage on a swift vessel, or they might face danger from raiders at sea or in coastal settlements.
