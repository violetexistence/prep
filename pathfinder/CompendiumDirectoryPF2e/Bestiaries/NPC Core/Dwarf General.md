Dwarven generals embody pride in knowledge and tactical acumen, using their understanding of warfare and battlefield strategy to coordinate their subordinates into optimal locations. They also remain ready to enter combat at a moment's notice and bring a fight to an enemy themselves.

From the dwarven perspective, most things in life are best done correctly, and that means taking one's time. Dwarves are a focused and intentional people, taking years or even decades to ply their trades, doing their best to make every detail perfect. The patience and dedication required for such tasks pays off, and many dwarves become experts in their respective field, trade, or area of focus. Many dwarves uphold traditions, and since dwarven origins trace back to underground life, many still hone skills focused on life underground.
