The maintenance and operation of a siege weapon is the highest form of art for the artillerist. They are second to none in terms of reliability and speed due to years of experience and training. Their mastery is such that they often construct smaller models of their preferred weapon to mount on their shoulders. Many will insist this is in case of an emergency, but they often truly enjoy crafting, designing, and perfecting their personal piece of artillery. Traditionally, artillerists are used on both side of a siege. Massive weapons are both fired towards the walls and from the walls. In such battles, artillerists are invaluable. However, artillerists are seen in other places outside of massive wars. For example, artillerists are often employed on ships to manage their cannons and harpoons.

Although relatively uncommon across much of Golarion, the frequently eccentric but undeniably brilliant minds who create elaborate devices of clockwork, gunpowder, and steam often loom much larger in the public eye than their numbers would suggest.
