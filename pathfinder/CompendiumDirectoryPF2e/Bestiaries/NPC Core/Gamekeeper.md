Gamekeepers know every beast that walks, slithers, flies, or swims in their territory and where to find them; try to keep up with the pack if you think you can. The land has chosen these people as guardians, giving them mysterious powers while in their territory. They are prepared to keep balance.

Explorers are often well-equipped and well-trained for any type of hazard and are eager to lead others into the wild.
