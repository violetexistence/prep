  - name: "Pantomime"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (illusion,mental,visual) The mime uses exaggerated movements to emulate one of the following effects, which lasts until the end of their next turn. Any creature who sees this ability can attempt to disbelieve this ability as it is used with a `DC 14 Will check` save. Creatures that disbelieve are temporarily immune to pantomime for 1 minute.\n\n_Barrier_: The mime creates an invisible 10-foot-by-10-foot stretch of wall adjacent to them and within their reach. The wall has AC 10, 5 hardness, and 10 HP. If the mime Sustains this effect, they can add an additional wall in the same manner.\n\n_Rope_: The mime tugs an invisible rope, trying to knock over or pull at a creature within 15 feet. If the creature fails to disbelieve the pantomime, the mime can choose to either knock the creature [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] or to move it 5 feet towards them.\n\n_Wind_: The mime creates a 30-foot line of imaginary wind. Creatures who don't disbelieve the pantomime treat this area as difficult terrain, and if they enter or begin their turn in the area, they fall prone."

Mimes are performers who use movement, gestures, and expressions without any speech to act out a scene or situation for onlookers.

Performances come in a wide variety of forms, from musical methods like singing and instruments to physical dancing and juggling to simple orating and conversing.
