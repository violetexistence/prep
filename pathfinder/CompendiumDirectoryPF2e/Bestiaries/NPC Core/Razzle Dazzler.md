A creature who attacks the razzle dazzler must first attempt a `DC 11 Flat check`. On a failure, the attack misses the razzle dazzler and destroys the illusion instead, ending this effect."

The razzle dazzler is a particularly beguiling sort of entertainer who specializes in delighting with illusions and showy displays. Whether with their illusory double or some well-timed fireworks, they are exceptionally good at keeping their audiences focused on one display to distract from the secrets that make their magic possible.

* * *

Because their ancestors came from the First World, gnomes are intrinsically linked to the realm of the fey and crave the mystical and unpredictable. They seek to create daring works of art, voyage to new places, and have experiences they've never had before. Otherwise, they could fall victim to the terrible gnomish illness known as the Bleaching, which not only drains them of their color but of their spirits as well.
