This allows the librarian to use Library Lore in place of other lore skills, given enough time. The GM determines the DC of the check and the amount of time it takes (typically, a librarian can attempt three or four checks during 1 day of downtime)."

Keepers of knowledge, librarians document discoveries, events, and laws. The best librarians record events twice: once for public record and again to record how events truly unfolded.

True power comes from knowledgeâ€”the power to shape the growth of kingdoms by mere whispers, stay three steps ahead of adversaries, or even know which flora is best for creating untraceable poisons.
