Zealots ferret out plots against their religion and seek justice for their church's followers. This zealot serves Asmodeus, but others might serve Abadar, Calistria, Iomedae, Norgorber, Pharasma, Sarenrae, or Zon-Kuthon. They often ride a [[Monster Core/War Horse|War Horse]] wearing light barding. To depict a zealot's mount, add this horse to the encounter as an additional monster with its own actions, adjusting the encounter's XP budget accordingly.
