Though court jesters are often put-upon as the targets of easy mockery and idle amusements, do not mistake their self-deprecation for weakness. Beneath, the jester hides malice, a sharp tongue, and even sharper knives. They can often be found entertaining the nobles of court or preparing their next japes. During the indiscreet hours of the night, they may be found in the company of servants and spymasters.
