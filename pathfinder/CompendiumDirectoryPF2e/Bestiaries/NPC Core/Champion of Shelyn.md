Champions are bastions of their deities' virtues and are living beacons for their causes. Those who walk these paths must adhere to the tenets of their patron deity or risk losing their abilities altogether. The champion depicted here follows the example of Shelyn, embodying the spirit of inspiring beauty and fighting for the cause of peace.
