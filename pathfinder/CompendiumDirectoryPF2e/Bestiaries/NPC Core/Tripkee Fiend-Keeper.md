Tripkees have a technique for dealing with unholy threats that has been passed down through the generations. A fiend keeper can absorb unholy spirits into their body before those entities can cause trouble for their kin. Though they can tap into this power when necessary, tripkee fiend keepers try to cleanse themselves of its evil influence by undertaking good deeds.

Traditionally making their homes in the treetops of tropical jungles and forests, these frog-like humanoids are often seen as resourceful and cautious, preferring to live and hunt hidden in the branches of tall trees.
