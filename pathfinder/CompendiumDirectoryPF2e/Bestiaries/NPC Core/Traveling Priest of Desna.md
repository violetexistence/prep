Deities and their religions are only as strong as the belief of their faithful. Traveling priests spread word to all corners of Golarion, building the numbers devoted to their denomination through their journeys. No matter where they may be headed or found, a traveling priest is likely to be healing someone with a spell, delivering a message, or simply trying to ensure their faith is spread.

Religions inspire devout individuals to uphold their tenets.
