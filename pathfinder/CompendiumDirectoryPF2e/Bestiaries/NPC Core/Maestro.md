A maestro is a performer who has achieved true excellence. These virtuosos can inspire those around them to greater heights or strike fear in their enemies' hearts.

Performances come in a wide variety of forms, from musical methods like singing and instruments to physical dancing and juggling to simple orating and conversing.
