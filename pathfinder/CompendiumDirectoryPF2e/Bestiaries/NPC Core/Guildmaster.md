In cities, artisans working in a common trade often form guilds to set standards of quality, establish common prices, engage in collective bargaining with business owners, and lobby local governments for favorable laws. The guildmaster—often a master artisan in their own right—also acts as an administrator and politician, advocating for artisans in their trade.

Expertise is forged through years of effort and often tedious work. Artisans are masters of their craft, able to create works both practical and beautiful.
