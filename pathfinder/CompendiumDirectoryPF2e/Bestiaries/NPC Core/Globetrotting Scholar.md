It takes a particular kind of personality to leave the creature comforts of academia in order to explore trap-ridden ancient tombs or observe man-eating monstrosities in their native habitats. The sort of personality that finds joy in the life cycle of parasitic wasps or recounts grisly Ghol-Gani sacrificial rites with a decidedly gruesome relish. Academia would not survive without such globetrotting scholars, but to their more sedate colleagues, they do tend to come off as an odd bunch.

True power comes from knowledge—the power to shape the growth of kingdoms by mere whispers, stay three steps ahead of adversaries, or even know which flora is best for creating untraceable poisons.
