    desc: "  Recipients of the ritualist's generosity pay dearly if the ritualist decides to turn against them. The ritualist gets a +4 circumstance bonus to attack rolls against any creature that has willingly participated in or benefited from one of their spells or rituals conducted in the last 12 hours. A creature that didn't help conduct a ritual still qualifies if it benefited in other ways, such as drinking a serving of [[Spells/Fortifying Brew|Fortifying Brew]].\n\nWhen the enchanting ritualist damages such a creature with a Strike, the target is affected by a 9th-rank [[Spells/Cursed Metamorphosis|Cursed Metamorphosis]] spell (DC 42). If the Strike was a critical hit, the creature gets a degree of success one worse than it rolled. Once a creature succeeds at a save against this spell, it is temporarily immune for 24 hours."

Possessing great stores of knowledge on mental magic and rituals, enchanting ritualists can also be solitary and capricious, tricking and transforming their visitors. The GM can change the selection of rituals this NPC knows freely, choosing any rituals of 9th rank or lower.

Hidden secrets and occult powers have an irresistible lure for many. Since the majority of these NPCs are spellcasters, consider using alternative spell lists to adjust their themes.
