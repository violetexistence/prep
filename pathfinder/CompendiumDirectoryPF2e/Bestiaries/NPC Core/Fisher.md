    desc: "  While it has persistent bleed damage from the fisher's fishing line Strike, a creature has a fishhook embedded in it. The creature can't move farther away from the fisher (though it can move laterally). The fisher can reel the creature in as a single action with the attack and manipulate trait, attempting an `Athletics check` check against the creature's Fortitude DC. On a success, the creature takes 2d4 slashing damage and is pulled 10 feet closer to the fisher (double the damage and distance on a critical success)."

More than just hobbyists, fishers catch fish and other seafood with the intention of selling most of or all of their catch.
