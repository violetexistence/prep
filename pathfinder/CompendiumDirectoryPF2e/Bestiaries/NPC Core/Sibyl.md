Sibyls are oracular diviners who often fall deep into trances with their oracular curses to spur a frenzied mental state. In this trance, they connect with gods and spirits, albeit in a disorganized haze. Some false sibyls will use substances to try and attempt to bring on this same frantic connection, often with deadly results.
