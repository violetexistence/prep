The watchmage Strikes with the required weapon. This counts as two attacks for the watchmage's multiple attack penalty. On a hit, the target is also affected by the spell, though the target gets any normal defenses allowed by the spell.\n\nIf the spell is targeted, it targets the creature that was hit and no one else. If the spell is an area, the target must be in the area. A burst is centered on a corner of the target's square if the target is Medium or smaller, or the corner of a square closest to the creature's center if it's Large or larger. A cone or line emits from a square of the watchmage's choice adjacent to the target."

A watchmage uses a mix of magic and martial training to enforce the law. They magically detect invisible criminals, locate stolen property, and counter illegal spells.

Larger societies rely on those with the authority and the ability to interpret and enforce laws. Some carry out these duties fairly, but others are harsh and cruel, imposing severe punishments on anyone unable to pay for clemency.
