Small settlements can typically support one or two generalist merchants, and larger cities house multiple specialistsâ€”experts in one type of product. Merchants range from vendors hustling in the public square to wealthy tycoons running entire commercial organizations. A merchant might have an additional Lore skill about a specific category of item (such as jewelry or magic weapons), with a skill modifier equal to their Mercantile Lore.

Expertise is forged through years of effort and often tedious work. Artisans are masters of their craft, able to create works both practical and beautiful.
