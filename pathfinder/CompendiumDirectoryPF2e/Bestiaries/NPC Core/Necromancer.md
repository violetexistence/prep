    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,manipulate,occult) The necromancer summons two Medium undead entities in different empty squares up to 30 feet away. These undead entities can take the form of zombies, skeletons, or ghosts, chosen by the necromancer. The entities block movement as though they were creatures and can be attacked. Each entity has 1 Hit Point and the same AC and saves as the necromancer. They can't take actions of their own and deteriorate if the necromancer is reduced to 0 Hit Points. The necromancer can have up to four undead entities at any given time. If they call another, the oldest undead entity deteriorates."

Defiling the natural order and spitting in the face of convention, the necromancer remains dutifully committed to understanding what forces await beyond the mortal boundaries of life and death.

Hidden secrets and occult powers have an irresistible lure for many. Since the majority of these NPCs are spellcasters, consider using alternative spell lists to adjust their themes.
