To outsiders, the eldritch emeritus looks something like a joke—a befuddled old scholar, their mind so stuffed with obscure theorems and abstract metaphysics that concerns about mere daily reality fade away. Those who know them, however, know that the eldritch emeritus wrote more treatises of spells than most wizards have had hot dinners, and if sufficiently annoyed, is entirely capable of providing a brief, thorough, and fatal demonstration.
