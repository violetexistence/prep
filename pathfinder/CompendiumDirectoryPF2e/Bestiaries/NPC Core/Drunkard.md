Every tavern has one-that person who drinks a little too much and starts a fight. While many drunkards are relatively harmless, a few have a hair trigger, and when they're set off come, no one-even the drunkard themself-can tell you what started the row.

Countless adventures begin in a tavern or a pub. Maybe it's because such places attract the risk-prone, or maybe it's because everyone needs a little liquid courage before they decide to take on a group of rampaging ogres.
