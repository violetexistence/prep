    desc: "  Scent involves sensing creatures or objects by smell, and is usually a vague sense. The range is listed in the ability, and it functions only if the creature or object being detected emits an aroma (for instance, incorporeal creatures usually do not exude an aroma).\n\nIf a creature emits a heavy aroma or is upwind, the GM can double or even triple the range of scent abilities used to detect that creature, and the GM can reduce the range if a creature is downwind."

Masterful catfolk hunters travel the far corners of the world, stalking terrible the monsters who dwell there in hopes of someday putting an end to their predations. They eagerly cooperate with other adventurers to defeat demons, aberrations, and malevolent beasts and fey.

* * *

Catfolk can be found traveling almost anywhere, and they are quick to settle down for a chat when they encounter fellow travelers. Some trade stories, act as guides, or operate at the fringes of polite society.
