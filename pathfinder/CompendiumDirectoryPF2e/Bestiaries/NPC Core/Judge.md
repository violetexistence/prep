    desc: "`pf2:2` (auditory,concentrate,emotion,fear,mental) The judge reminds a creature of the oath they swore to the court. The judge makes an `Intimidation check` check against the target's Will DC. On a success, the target takes a –2 status penalty to Deception checks to [[Actions/Lie|Lie]] for 10 minutes (or a –4 status penalty on a critical success). Regardless of the result, the target is temporarily immune to this ability for 24 hours.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Remember, You're Under Oath|Effect: Remember, You're Under Oath]]"

Properly exercised, the duties of a judge include strict adherence to the law regardless of station, with minimal sentimentality. Yet for every unbiased justice, there's one who is zealously confident in their own agenda.

Larger societies rely on those with the authority and the ability to interpret and enforce laws. Some carry out these duties fairly, but others are harsh and cruel, imposing severe punishments on anyone unable to pay for clemency.
