Accuser agents might be high court advocates, official spymasters, or innocuous adjutants delivering important messages to magistrates, generals, officers, or mercenaries. They have ample latitude in matters of government security, though they sometimes have little oversight. When their findings demand an official response, accuser agents present cases before national tribunals or in royal courts.

Larger societies rely on those with the authority and the ability to interpret and enforce laws. Some carry out these duties fairly, but others are harsh and cruel, imposing severe punishments on anyone unable to pay for clemency.
