Kobold earth divers study the geology of the areas near their communities. The mystical influence of their community's patron or years of extensive training at digging or earth magic allow them to swiftly burrow through the ground and to feel movements in the ground beneath their feet.

* * *

Kobolds are drawn to beings and objects of power, establishing their communities near them. Once a warren has been formed, the resident kobolds construct traps and set up ambushes to deter interlopers.
