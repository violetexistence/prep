With daring and charm, a driver is a professional operator of mechanical vehicles. Their skill and recklessness give them a reputation that puts even the quickest horse riders to shame. A driver's vehicle becomes an extension of themselves, allowing the driver to perform near-impossible feats of maneuverability. Drivers have other tricks up their sleeve, as their charm is undeniable. When needed, they can talk, lie, or frighten their way out of a bumpy situation in and out of a vehicle.
