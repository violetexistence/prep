While most engineers take immense pride in their work constructing something that may survive many lifetimes, the demolitionist takes pride in destroying such pompous things in the most spectacular way possible. Every design has a flaw, and that flaw usually involves large quantities of explosives. Demolitionists are often pragmatic and calculated, taking great care to destroy whatever lies before them as efficiently as possible.

Although relatively uncommon across much of Golarion, the frequently eccentric but undeniably brilliant minds who create elaborate devices of clockwork, gunpowder, and steam often loom much larger in the public eye than their numbers would suggest.
