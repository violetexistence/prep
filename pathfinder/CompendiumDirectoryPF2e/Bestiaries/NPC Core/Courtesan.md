Courtesans are high-class entertainers and professional companions, paid in favors and privileges for the honor of their company. These trendsetting socialites levy their clout to consort with those above their station, maneuvering connections to build exclusive clientele and climb the social ladder. A courtesan's discretion and mobility among the different ranks of society make their friendship well worth the price.
