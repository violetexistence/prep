These bonuses don't apply against demons. At the end of the day, the demonologist must attempt a `DC 20 Will check` save, becoming possessed for 1 day on a failure (or permanently on a critical failure)."

Hidden secrets and occult powers have an irresistible lure for many. Since the majority of these NPCs are spellcasters, consider using alternative spell lists to adjust their themes.
