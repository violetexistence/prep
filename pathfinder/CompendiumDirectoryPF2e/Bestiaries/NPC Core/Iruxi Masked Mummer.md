Iruxi masked mummers bring lizardfolk myths to life, donning elaborate costumes and bone masks to enact stories featuring their ancestors, the gods, legendary dragons and dinosaurs, and nature spirits of all kinds.

The most talented mummers claim their ritual dances invite these spirits inside them, suffusing their bodies with starlight and lending them primal power uniquely tied to the luminaries their masks represent. This magic can be seen even by those without magical ability, as they can see glowing motes shaped like distant stars seeming to float under the skin of the mummer.

Lizardfolk culture has flowered in recent years. With that revival has come a new generation of iruxis (as they call themselves) more willing to engage with the wider world, bringing with them their society's reverence for the past, facility with nature, and willingness to defend itself.
