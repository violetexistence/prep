There is no better way for a ysoki to distinguish themself than to defend the warren, with many proving themselves by venturing out and challenging monsters they come across. Those who return triumphant from such tests find themselves among the ranks of ysoki warriors, able to wear their accomplishments as a badge of pride. They often venture out again once established and experienced to attain more notoriety as warriors.

Ysoki (or, as outsiders call them, ratfolk) in their warrens have a society that is both stern and democratic, caring and ever vigilant. And at the top is a handful of intimidating and protective figures who make sure the swarm remains safe.
