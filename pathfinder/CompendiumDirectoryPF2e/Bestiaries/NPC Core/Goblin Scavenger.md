    desc: "  The scavenger's gun is a comically oversized hand cannon that has the fatal d12 trait and a 20-foot range increment. If a Strike with it critically fails, the weapon misfires and explodes, dealing 1d12 fire damage to its wielder. It's a martial one-handed weapon with 2 Bulk and a Price of 10 gp. It has the uncommon, cobbled, and goblin traits. The cobbled trait means that on a failed attack roll with the gun, the user must succeed at a `DC 5 Flat check` or the weapon misfires."

Many goblins scavenge materials, shiny objects, and anything else they can get their hands on, but a goblin scavenger is the best at finding such useful items. More importantly, they're great at making use of them without killing themselves. Most of the time.

Goblins can be found across Golarion, sometimes threatening taller humanoids (whom they refer to as "longshanks") and sometimes redeeming harmful history by working alongside others.
