They must transform into an animal of a kind they've seen within the last 24 hours. They can't gain temporary HP again from a spell cast with Gift of the Wild Spirits for 10 minutes. Their Strikes for forms other than _pest form_ have reach 10 feet, a +20 attack modifier, and a +13 damage bonus (or a +9 damage bonus for _aerial form_). Most other changes to their statistics are listed above.\n\nWhile polymorphed, the skin shifter can still use Gift of the Wild Spirits, though they're still prevented from casting other spells as normal."

Skin shifters are defenders of nature, blessed by the spirits of the wild with the ability to shape shift into powerful animal forms. Prowling as beasts or charging across the field, they protect the balance of nature and punish those who would upset it.

A primalist is a wielder of primal energies and magic, sometimes taught by forces of primal power, including powerful elementals or fey of the First World. Primalists protect the natural world, offering strong medicine to those in need while facing suspicion from those who don't understand their ways.

A great many primalists belong to druidic circles, and even those who aren't members tend to be familiar with the most prominent ones in their homeland.
