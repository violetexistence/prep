The captain of the guard leads a troop of soldiers who serve as security forces for a powerful individual, most often a high-ranking noble or very rich merchant, though this stat block could also represent a lowerranking captain of the guard for the leader of a nation. A formidable opponent in their own right, the captain of the guard skillfully employs their troops to protect the life and health of their ward.

Larger societies rely on those with the authority and the ability to interpret and enforce laws. Some carry out these duties fairly, but others are harsh and cruel, imposing severe punishments on anyone unable to pay for clemency.
