Maintaining discipline is of the utmost importance when conducting a military campaign. Often elevated from veteran soldiers, drill sergeants are responsible for training common troops, ensuring they can follow orders and fight well in the thick of battle. Though drill sergeants can be brash and hard-nosed, harsh discipline is often crucial to maintaining order and keeping soldiers alive.

A military serves to defend and fight on behalf of nations and can be trained and deployed in various ways.
