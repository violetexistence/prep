The siegebreaker spends 10 minutes combining the ingredients from 9 different alchemical grenades of their choice. The siegebreaker then sets a fuse timer up to 1 minute long. When time's up, the bomb explodes in a concentrated 20-foot burst, dealing 20d6 acid, cold, or fire damage that ignores up to 10 Hardness of structures. Any creature in the area can reduce the damage they take with a `DC 37 Reflex check` save."

When a well-constructed or magically warded fortification repels every assault, a siegebreaker is called in. These masters of alchemical destruction find that the bigger and more protected the wall, the more satisfying it is to break it.
