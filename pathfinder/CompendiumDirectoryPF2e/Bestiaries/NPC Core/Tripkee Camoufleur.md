Camoufleurs, masters of natural camouflage, not only disguise their village scouts and warriors before they embark, but also create and maintain the village-wide concealment needed to keep their community hidden and safe. Just as others rely on engineers to build walls, tripkees rely on camoufleurs to protect their homes.

Traditionally making their homes in the treetops of tropical jungles and forests, these frog-like humanoids are often seen as resourceful and cautious, preferring to live and hunt hidden in the branches of tall trees.
