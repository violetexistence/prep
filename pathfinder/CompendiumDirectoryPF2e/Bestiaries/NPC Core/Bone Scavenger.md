Kholos have a strong connection to their ancestors, often using their bones as art and weapons to further honor them. Bone scavengers are sent to the fields after a battle to collect the bones of their fellow allies. They often eschew the pack hunting techniques of other kholos, spreading out among their foes when encountered in groups.

* * *

These pragmatic hunters have earned a very poor reputation for their brutality in battle and worship of demons. While many kholos live up to the terrible stories of their ferocity and cannibalism, others are scavengers and trappers just trying to get by. Many of their cultural traditions are misunderstood by other ancestries, and some kholos play into the fear provoked in those who believe the twisted tales about their people. Kholos are often criticized for their lack of honor in battle, but a kholo understands honor doesn't bring you back home alive, nor does honor put food on the table. Ambushes, feints, and deceptions that lead to fewer kholo deaths and a quicker victory are simply the logical thing to do.
