Many musicians make their living off stage by playing at markets, fairs, or crossroads. While their fame may not be as widespread as theatrical performers, they are nonetheless staples of many communities.

Performances come in a wide variety of forms, from musical methods like singing and instruments to physical dancing and juggling to simple orating and conversing.
