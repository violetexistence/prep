Wardens are the chief guardians of borders and frontiers. Whether standing watch over a single village or an entire region, wardens keep a vigilant eye out for threats to their charges. Wardens are stalwart folk, often called to duty by Erastil to protect those around them. Be it times of war or along the frontier, wardens are often the balanced edge of a blade between a community and the wilds at its fringes.

Larger societies rely on those with the authority and the ability to interpret and enforce laws. Some carry out these duties fairly, but others are harsh and cruel, imposing severe punishments on anyone unable to pay for clemency.
