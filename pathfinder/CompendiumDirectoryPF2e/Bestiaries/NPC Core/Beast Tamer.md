    desc: "  The beast tamer gains the support benefit appropriate to its trained animal companion. Unlike for an animal companion, this doesn't require the animal to use any of its actions. The benefit for a [[Monster Core/Tiger|Tiger]] is as follows: Until the start of the beast tamer's next turn, their Strikes that deal damage to a creature within the tiger's reach make the target [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the end of the beast tamer's next turn."

Beast tamers bring the wild to civilization, rearing and training creatures to follow their commands and perform flashy tricks that entertain audiences. The beast tamer typically fights alongside a trained animal ally of its level or lower, most likely a tiger (Monster Core 51).
