Foragers know the areas they live and work in like no other. They can tell you exactly where to find a rare medicinal fern, when to harvest it, and how to use it; just don't expect them to be up-to-date on the latest town gossip. They spend as much time in the wilderness as they can, filling their baskets with a variety of useful plants.

Explorers are often well-equipped and well-trained for any type of hazard and are eager to lead others into the wild.
