The fiend caller attempts a Legal Lore check against the higher of the fiend's Will DC or Diplomacy DC.\n* * *\n\n**Success** The mortal party receives one favor from the fiend, or the fiend becomes the mortal's minion for 1d4 days if they're on the same plane. Alternatively, if the GM allows the option, the mortal can receive a bargained contract of the fiend's level or lower.\n\n**Failure** The fiend caller fails to strike the bargain.\n\n**Critical Failure** The process fails, and the magical backlash makes the fiend caller [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 2]]."
