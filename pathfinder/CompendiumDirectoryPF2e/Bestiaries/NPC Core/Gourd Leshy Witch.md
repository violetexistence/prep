    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,polymorph,primal) The gourd leshy witch transforms into a Small gourd. This ability otherwise uses the effects of [[Spells/One with Plants|One with Plants]].\n* * *\n\nThe monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block."

On a critical success, the target is also knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]. The broom immediately returns to the gourd leshy witch's hand."

Some spooky leshies learn the ways of occult spellcasting from strange spirits of nature that lurk just out of sight or under cover of darkness. These witches treat their brooms as their familiars, imbuing the wood and straw with a sliver of sentience.

* * *

Nature spirits inhabit bodies made of plants or fungi, blooming from primal magic to become the small people called leshies. They come in a truly immense number of diverse shapes and sizes, more so than most peoples of Golarion. This variety of forms means a leshy could have a place in nearly any type of setting for any type of story.
