The warmonger's ranged Strikes against that creature gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the attack roll and deal an extra 3d6 precision damage. Each time the warmonger hits that creature with a ranged Strike, the creature takes a â€“10-foot penalty to its Speeds for 1 minute and falls 20 feet if it's flying.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Sight Prey (Speed Penalty)|Effect: Sight Prey (Speed Penalty)]]"

Warmongers believe the base state of life is violence. They stay in peak physical condition with constant training and keep their supplies ready for marching to war.
