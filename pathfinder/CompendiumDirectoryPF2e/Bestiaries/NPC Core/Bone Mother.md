The bone mother—a warren's oracle—cuts an imposing figure. Bone mothers can be any gender despite the name, wearing the skull of a giant rat and covering their clothing in dangling bones. When a member of the warren dies, they gift a bone (usually a finger bone) to the oracle, who exists as both a physical repository of those who came before and a living history of their warren.

* * *

Ysoki (or, as outsiders call them, ratfolk) in their warrens have a society that is both stern and democratic, caring and ever vigilant. And at the top is a handful of intimidating and protective figures who make sure the swarm remains safe.
