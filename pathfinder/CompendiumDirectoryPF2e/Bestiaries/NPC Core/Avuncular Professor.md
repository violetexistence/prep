Once per hour, if the avuncular professor succeeds at a Deception or Diplomacy check, they can choose to roll a Society or Academia Lore check at the same DC—if they succeed on the second check, the initial success is upgraded to a critical success, though if they fail the second check, their initial success also turns into a failure."

True power comes from knowledge—the power to shape the growth of kingdoms by mere whispers, stay three steps ahead of adversaries, or even know which flora is best for creating untraceable poisons.
