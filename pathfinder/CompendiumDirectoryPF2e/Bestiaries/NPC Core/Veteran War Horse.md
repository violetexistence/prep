A veteran war horse has not only been extensively trained but has also experienced battle several times. They have grown used to the chaos of war and fearlessly strides forward, striking fear into their enemies. A veteran war horse could accompany a champion, champion of Rovagug, captain of the guard, deific champion, equestrian constable, or orc gamekeeper.
