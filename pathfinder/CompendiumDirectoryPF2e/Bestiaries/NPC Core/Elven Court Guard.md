    desc: "`pf2:2`  The guard makes a Strike against a creature, then Strides. This Stride doesn't trigger reactions. If the guard ends this Stride in a different space adjacent to the same creature, they make another Strike against it. If both Strikes succeed, the creature is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the start of the guard's next turn. Each attack counts toward the guard's multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until they've made both attacks."
