Big boss goblins order members of their band around and deal with any longshanks they come across—sometimes via violence or diplomacy, and sometimes by ordering another goblin to deal with them (in ways that the big boss goblin approves of if they work or claims were awful ideas they never would have tried if they don't). These goblin leaders often insist on impressive titles or sobriquets like "The Exceedingly Incendiary," "Snake Singer," or "Most Gluttonest," though these can often be exaggerated by several degrees for dramatic effect or even change at the big boss goblin's whim (often to one-up a rival).

* * *

Goblins can be found across Golarion, sometimes threatening taller humanoids (whom they refer to as "longshanks") and sometimes redeeming harmful history by working alongside others.
