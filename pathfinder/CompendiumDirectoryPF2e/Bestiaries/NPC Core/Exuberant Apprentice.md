The exuberant apprentice attempts to cast [[Spells/Fireball|Fireball]] as a 3rd-rank arcane spell but must first attempt a `DC 11 Flat check`.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The spell is cast flawlessly and heightened to 4th rank. The apprentice is [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 2]] from sheer shock.\n\n**Success** Nothing goes wrong, and the spell is cast normally.\n\n**Failure** The spell fizzles and creates only a harmless puff of smoke.\n\n**Critical Failure** Academic ablaze!
