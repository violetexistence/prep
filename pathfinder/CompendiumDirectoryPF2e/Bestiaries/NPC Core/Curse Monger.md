  - name: "Share Burden"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,curse) The curse monger shares their awful burden with one creature they can see within 120 feet. The target must succeed at a `DC 37 Will check` save or be afflicted with the same condition as the curse monger's incurable curse for 24 hours. On a critical failure, the curse's value is 2. The curse lasts for 24 hours but can be removed (unlike the incurable curse), and ends if the curse monger dies. This action has the same tradition trait as incurable curse."

Oracles who have been consumed by their visions and the divine gifts bestowed upon them turn to more sinister paths, becoming curse mongers. Seeking to rid themselves of the shadows that haunt them, curse mongers lash out and attempt to bind others to their fate.

Hidden secrets and occult powers have an irresistible lure for many. Since the majority of these NPCs are spellcasters, consider using alternative spell lists to adjust their themes.
