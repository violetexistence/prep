For 24 hours, when that creature fails a skill check or saving throw, they can recall this advice and reroll the check, using the second result instead. Once that creature uses this ability, its effect ends. A creature that receives the Innkeeper's Advice is temporarily immune to the ability for 1 month."

The sight of an inn is a welcome one to any weary traveler. Innkeepers can often be found cleaning the common room, overseeing the evening meal, or settling in new lodgers. Innkeepers keep an eye on their neighbors' doings and are often excellent sources of information.
