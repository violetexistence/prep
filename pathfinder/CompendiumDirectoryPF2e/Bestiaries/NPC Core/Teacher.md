The passing of knowledge and traditions from generation to generation is a time-honored occupation. Teachers exist to strengthen their populations with literacy, history, and advanced sciences, but most of all with inspiration. Most teachers provide general knowledge so their students are well-rounded, but some are experts or even masters of a single discipline.
