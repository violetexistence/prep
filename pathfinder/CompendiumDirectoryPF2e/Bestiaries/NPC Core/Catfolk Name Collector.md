Name collectors are esteemed touchstones of catfolk culture. They record the adventures of catfolk heroes, speak to spirits, and tell legends about strange and faraway places.

Catfolk can be found traveling almost anywhere, and they are quick to settle down for a chat when they encounter fellow travelers. Some trade stories, act as guides, or operate at the fringes of polite society.
