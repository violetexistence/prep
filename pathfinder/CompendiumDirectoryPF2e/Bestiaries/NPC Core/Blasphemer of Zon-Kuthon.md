Blasphemers spread messages contrary to the tenets of their faith, often out of the belief that the gods are specifically targeting them to spread this message. In some cultures, such as Nidal, this is a heretical crime and can send a blasphemer on the run from the law.

Religions inspire devout individuals to uphold their tenets.
