With the tengu diaspora spreading across much of Golarion, their knowledge and tradition of blade crafting has been passed through the generations to those who show interest and aptitude. Many tengu bladesmiths have experience as warriors; others learn their sword craft to improve their knowledge and understanding of the weapons they produce.

* * *

Originally hailing from the continent of Tian Xia, tengu have spread across the globe. Though some staunchly uphold traditions, gazing at the sky from the tallest mountaintops, other tengu remain on the ground, adapting and blending into the societies in which they settle.
