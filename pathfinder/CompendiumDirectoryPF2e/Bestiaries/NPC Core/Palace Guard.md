Often the younger offspring of minor nobility or those from long lines of trusted staff, palace guards are in charge of defending the royal family and their inner stronghold. Their days consist of guarding doorways, escorting nobles, and keeping those in their charge as safe as possible.

The denizens of a noble court are the most powerful people in a civilization, primed with wealth, station, and authority above the common people.
