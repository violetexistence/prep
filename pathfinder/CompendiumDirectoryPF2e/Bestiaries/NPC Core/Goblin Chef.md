Goblins eat almost anything. Though they'll survive on raw or little-cooked meat, some prefer searing or frying their food firstâ€”or better yet, pickling it! A goblin chef can make anything edible (at least to a goblin).

Goblins can be found across Golarion, sometimes threatening taller humanoids (whom they refer to as "longshanks") and sometimes redeeming harmful history by working alongside others.
