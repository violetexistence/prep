Personalized modifications and a need for constant tinkering mean that other creatures are unable to take advantage of the special abilities of the diving suit and treat it as an ordinary suit of half plate."

A new breed of pirate, these raiders strike at unsuspecting ships from beneath the cover of the waves. The bulky, reinforced diving suits they wear also serve as armor and clockwork mechanisms augment their strength.

Adventurers may need passage on a swift vessel, or they might face danger from raiders at sea or in coastal settlements.
