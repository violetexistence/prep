Whether kidnapped, conscripted, or having entered voluntary service, a tengu in the role of jinx eater on a ship's crew is tasked with keeping the crew free of misfortune. Those with the necessary skill to do so often achieve a respected and privileged position on board.

Originally hailing from the continent of Tian Xia, tengu have spread across the globe. Though some staunchly uphold traditions, gazing at the sky from the tallest mountaintops, other tengu remain on the ground, adapting and blending into the societies in which they settle.
