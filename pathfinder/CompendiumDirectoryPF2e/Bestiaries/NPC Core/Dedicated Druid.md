Individuals who dedicate their life to the protection and preservation of the natural world often become druids. These devoted practitioners of primal magic might work alone or in a circle of like-minded individuals, all of whom have primal powers more terrifying than the last.

* * *

A primalist is a wielder of primal energies and magic, sometimes taught by forces of primal power, including powerful elementals or fey of the First World. Primalists protect the natural world, offering strong medicine to those in need while facing suspicion from those who don't understand their ways.

A great many primalists belong to druidic circles, and even those who aren't members tend to be familiar with the most prominent ones in their homeland.
