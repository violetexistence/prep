Envied by many and detested by some, nobles exude confidence and gentility. Gossip and gambling are often nobles' favorite pastimes. Dayto-day life for a noble is usually a mixture of business and leisure, and to an onlooker, such a lifestyle can appear to be nothing more than a string of meals, parties, and game halls.

The denizens of a noble court are the most powerful people in a civilization, primed with wealth, station, and authority above the common people.
