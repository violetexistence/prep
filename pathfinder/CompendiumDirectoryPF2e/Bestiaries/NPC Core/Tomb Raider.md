Great treasure awaits those willing to explore the hazardous depths of ancient tombs and forgotten dungeons. Some tomb raiders seek the riches of bygone eras; others recover pieces of history thought lost to the sands of time.

* * *

Explorers are often well-equipped and well-trained for any type of hazard and are eager to lead others into the wild.
