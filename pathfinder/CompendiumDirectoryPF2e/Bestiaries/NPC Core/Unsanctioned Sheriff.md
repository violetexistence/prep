The sheriff can command a creature to approach the sheriff, release what its holding, or drop [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]. Regardless of the result of its save, the creature is temporarily immune for 10 minutes."

Believing the ends justify the means, the unsanctioned sheriff is unafraid to use others for their own gain, through bribes, manipulation, or force.
