Tripkee scouts are the first line of defense for their hidden treetop villages. They are often scattered throughout the forests in small groups to keep an eye out for anything new or dangerous that could pose a threat.

Traditionally making their homes in the treetops of tropical jungles and forests, these frog-like humanoids are often seen as resourceful and cautious, preferring to live and hunt hidden in the branches of tall trees.
