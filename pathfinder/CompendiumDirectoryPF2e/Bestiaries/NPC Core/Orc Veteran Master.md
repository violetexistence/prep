While the sword and shield are reliable and proven in battle, the veteran master is the weapon. They have been hardened by decades of fighting, but they still manage to find peace within themselves to gain a physical advantage.

Orcs have a strict moral code encompassing valor and accomplishment, and they cast out those unwilling to follow it. For the last few generations, orcs have been trying to erase the narratives around their culture as being solely focused on war and violence. They invite other races and adventuring parties inside their holds so they may experience the truth of who the orcs are.
