This counts as two attacks for the gunwitch's multiple attack penalty. On a hit, the target is also affected by the spell, though the target gets any normal defenses allowed by the spell.\n\nIf the spell is targeted, it targets the creature that was hit and no one else. If the spell is an area, the target must be in the area. A burst is centered on a corner of the target's square if the target is Medium or smaller or the corner of a square closest to the creature's center if it's Large or larger. A cone or line emits from a square of the gunwitch's choice adjacent to the target."

As wielders of both occult power and firearms, gunwitches pride themselves in using both unconventional weapons and obscure magic. To change their patron ([[Class Features/Spinner of Threads|Spinner of Threads]]), swap out [[Spells/Nudge Fate|Nudge Fate]] and [[Spells/Sure Strike|Sure Strike]].

These lone wolves have an aura of mystery, bravado, and swagger.
