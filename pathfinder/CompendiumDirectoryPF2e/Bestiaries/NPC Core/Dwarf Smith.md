Many dwarves become smiths as their attention to detail, lifestyles that keep them close to useful materials such as iron, and a pride in their work all come together to become a brilliant skill set for working with armaments. Though dwarves are capable of smithing most any kind of item, most focus on armaments as a way of creating objects to defend their fellow dwarves.

From the dwarven perspective, most things in life are best done correctly, and that means taking one's time. Dwarves are a focused and intentional people, taking years or even decades to ply their trades, doing their best to make every detail perfect. The patience and dedication required for such tasks pays off, and many dwarves become experts in their respective field, trade, or area of focus. Many dwarves uphold traditions, and since dwarven origins trace back to underground life, many still hone skills focused on life underground.
