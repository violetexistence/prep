    desc: "`pf2:1`  The fleshwarper assesses vulnerabilities in a creature's anatomy. They attempt a `Medicine check` check against the Fortitude DC of one living creature they can see within 60 feet. On a success, the fleshwarper's melee Strikes deal an extra 2d8 precision damage against that creature for 1 minute or until the fleshwarper critically hits that creature, whichever comes first.\n\nUsing this action again designates a new target and ends the effect for any previous target. A fleshwarper can target an individual no more than once per day with this ability.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Conduct the Experiment|Effect: Conduct the Experiment]]"

The creature attempts a `DC 25 Fortitude check` save at the end of each of its turns, ending the mutation on a success. A creature that becomes mutated is thereafter temporarily immune to flesh mutation for 1 day.\n\n**1 Spongy Flesh** The creature has weakness 5 to physical damage.\n\n**2 Caustic Blood** The creature takes 2d4 persistent acid damage that can't be removed normally, but ends when the mutation does.\n\n**3 Sprouting Eyes** The creature is [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]], but also immune to flanking.\n\n**4 Mutated Mind** The creature is [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]]. It can still recover as noted in the condition, but if it does it remains [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the mutation ends.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Flesh Mutation|Effect: Flesh Mutation]]"

Cruel scientists called fleshwarpers create horrors from the flesh of others. Many desire to push science forward, but others need only grotesque glee.
