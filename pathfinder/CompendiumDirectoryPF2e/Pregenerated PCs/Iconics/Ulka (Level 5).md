    desc: "`pf2:1` (brandish,commander,tactic) Your team works to slip enemies into a disadvantageous position. Signal one squadmate within the aura of your banner; that squadmate can immediately Step as a free action. If they end this movement next to an opponent, they can attempt to [[Actions/Reposition|Reposition]] that target as a reaction."

  - name: "Gather to Me!"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (commander,tactic) You signal your team to move into position together. Signal all squadmates; each can immediately Stride as a reaction, though each must end their movement inside your banner's aura, or as close to your banner's aura as their movement Speed allows.\n\nSquadmates can use Gather to Me! while Burrowing, Climbing, Flying, or Swimming instead of Striding if they have the corresponding movement type."

  - name: "Pincer Attack"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (commander,tactic) You call for an aggressive formation designed for exploiting enemies' vulnerabilities. Signal all squadmates; each can Step as a reaction. If any of your allies ends this movement adjacent to an opponent, that opponent is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] to melee attacks from you and all other squadmates who responded to Pincer Attack until the start of your next turn."

  - name: "Protective Screen"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (brandish,commander,tactic) You've trained your allies in a technique designed to protect war mages. Signal one squadmate; as a reaction, that squadmate Strides directly toward any other squadmate who is within the aura of your banner. If the first squadmate ends their movement adjacent to another squadmate, the second squadmate does not trigger reactions when casting spells or making ranged attacks until the end of their next turn or until they are no longer adjacent to the first squadmate, whichever comes first. If the first squadmate ends their movement adjacent to more than one other squadmate, the first squadmate must choose which of the adjacent squadmates gains this benefit."

  - name: "Strike Hard!"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (brandish,commander,tactic) You command an ally to attack. Signal a squadmate within the aura of your commander's banner. That ally immediately attempts a Strike as a reaction."
