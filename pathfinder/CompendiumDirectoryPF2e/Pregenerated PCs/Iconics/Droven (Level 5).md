    desc: "`pf2:2` (fire,inventor,manipulate,unstable) You intentionally take your innovation beyond normal safety limits, making it explode and damage nearby creatures without damaging the innovation... hopefully. The explosion deals 2d6 damage with a `Reflex check` to all creatures in a 5-foot emanation around you (if you're wearing or holding the innovation) or around your innovation (if your innovation is a minion).\n\nAt 3rd level, and every level thereafter, increase your explosion's damage by 1d6.\n\nIf you have the breakthrough innovation class feature, you can choose either a 5-foot or 10-foot emanation for the area when you use Explode; if you have the revolutionary innovation class feature, you can choose a 5-foot, 10-foot, or 15-foot emanation."

    desc: "`pf2:1` (inventor,manipulate) **Frequency** once per round\n* * *\n\nTemporarily cranking the gizmos on your body into overdrive, you try to add greater power to your attacks. Attempt a `Crafting check` check that has a standard DC for your level.\n\n[[Feat_Feature Effects/Effect_ Overdrive|Effect: Overdrive]]\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** Your gizmos go into a state of incredible efficiency called critical overdrive, adding great power to your attacks. Your Strikes deal additional damage equal to your Intelligence modifier for 1 minute. After the Overdrive ends, your gizmos become unusable as they cool down or reset, and you can't use Overdrive for 1 minute.\n\n**Success** Your gizmos go into overdrive, adding power to your attacks. As critical success, except the additional damage is equal to half your Intelligence modifier.\n\n**Failure** Your gizmos whine concerningly and begin to smoke. Your Strikes deal 1 additional fire damage.\n\n**Critical Failure** Whoops! Something explodes. You take fire damage equal to half your level (rounded up), and you can't use Overdrive again for 1d4 rounds as your gizmos reset.\n* * *\n\n**Special** When under the effects of Overdrive, you can still use the Overdrive action. You can't extend your Overdrive's duration this way, but you can turn an overdrive into a critical overdrive if you critically succeed. A failure has no effect on your current Overdrive, and you end your Overdrive on a critical failure."
