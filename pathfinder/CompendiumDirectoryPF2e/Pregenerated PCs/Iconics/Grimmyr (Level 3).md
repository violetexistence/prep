    desc: "`pf2:r` (guardian) **Trigger** An ally within 10 feet of you takes physical damage.\n* * *\n\nYou fling yourself in the way of oncoming harm to protect an ally. You can Step, but you must end your movement adjacent to the triggering ally. You take the damage instead of the triggering ally. Apply your own immunities, weaknesses, and resistances to the damage, not the ally's.\n* * *\n\n**Special** You can extend this ability to an ally within 15 feet of you if the damage comes from your taunted enemy. If this ally is farther than you can Step to reach, you can Stride instead of Stepping; you still must end the movement adjacent to your ally."

    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,guardian) With an attention-grabbing gesture, noise, cutting remark, or threatening shout, you attempt to draw an enemy to you instead of your allies. Taunt gains the auditory trait, visual trait, or both, depending on how you draw the target's attention. Even mindless creatures are drawn to your taunts. Choose an enemy within 30 feet to be your taunted enemy. If your taunted enemy takes a hostile action that includes at least one of your allies but doesn't include you, they take a â€“1 circumstance penalty to their attack rolls and DCs for that action, and they also become [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the start of their next turn.\n\nYour enemy remains taunted until the start of your next turn, and you can have only one Taunt in effect at a time. Taunting a new enemy ends this effect on any current target.\n\n[[Feat_Feature Effects/Effect_ Taunt|Effect: Taunt]]"
