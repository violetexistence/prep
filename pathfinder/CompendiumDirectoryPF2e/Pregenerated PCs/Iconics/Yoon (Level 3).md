  - name: "[[Actions/Base Kinesis|Base Kinesis]]"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (impulse,kineticist,primal) It's trivial for you to create some of your element or alter a portion of it that already exists. Choose one of your kinetic elements to affect. This impulse has a range of 30 feet, and the Bulk of the target must be negligible or light. The GM decides what Bulk the element is. You can't affect an element that's magical, secured in place (like a stone mortared in a wall), or attended by a creature unwilling to let you.\n\nChoose one of the following options, though the GM might allow you to make similar small alterations. Base Kinesis can't deal damage or cause conditions unless otherwise noted.\n\n*   **Generate** You bring an ordinary, non-magical piece of the chosen element from its elemental plane. The element can be used for any of its normal uses. For example, air can be breathed by an air-breathing creature, and fire casts light and can ignite flammable substances.\n*   **Move** Move an existing piece of the element up to 20 feet in any direction. If you bring it into your space, you can catch it in an open hand. You can Sustain the impulse to keep moving the element.\n*   **Suppress** You destroy an existing piece of element, such as snuffing out a flame or evaporating water from a cup. This affects only natural forms of the element, not durable, crafted goods like a stone statue, metal lock, or wooden door.\n    \n    * * *\n    \n    **Level (+4)** The range increases by 15 feet, and the maximum Bulk increases by 1 (allowing Bulk 1 at 5th level)."

  - name: "[[Actions/Channel Elements|Channel Elements]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (aura,kineticist,primal) **Requirements** Your kinetic gate isn't active.\n* * *\n\nYou tap into your kinetic gate to make elements flow around you. Your kinetic aura activates, and as a part of this action, you can use a 1-action Elemental Blast or a 1-action stance impulse. Your kinetic aura is a 10-foot emanation where pieces of your kinetic element (or all your kinetic elements, if you can channel more than one) flow around you. The kinetic aura can't damage anything or affect the environment around you unless another ability allows it to. Channel Elements has the traits of all your kinetic elements.\n\nYour kinetic aura automatically deactivates if you're knocked out, you use an impulse with the overflow trait, or you Dismiss the aura. Though you can't use new impulses while your kinetic aura is deactivated, ones you already used remain, and you can still Sustain any that can be sustained. Stance impulses are linked to your kinetic aura and end when the aura deactivates."

  - name: "[[Actions/Elemental Blast|Elemental Blast]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (attack,impulse,kineticist,primal) `pf2:1` or `pf2:2`\n* * *\n\nWith a wave of your hand, you collect elemental matter from your aura and swing or hurl it. Choose one of your kinetic elements and a damage type listed for that element, then make a melee or ranged impulse attack against the AC of one creature. Add your Strength modifier to the damage roll for a melee Elemental Blast. If you make a 2-action Elemental Blast, you gain a status bonus to the damage roll equal to your Constitution modifier. The element determines the damage die, damage type, and range (for a ranged blast). A damage type other than a physical damage type adds its trait to the blast.\n\n*   **Air** 1d6 electricity or slashing, 60 feet\n*   **Earth** 1d8 bludgeoning or piercing, 30 feet\n*   **Fire** 1d6 fire, range 60 feet\n*   **Metal** 1d8 piercing or slashing, 30 feet\n*   **Water** 1d8 bludgeoning or cold, 30 feet\n*   **Wood** 1d8 bludgeoning or vitality, 30 feet\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target takes double damage.\n\n**Success** The target takes full damage.\n* * *\n\n**Level (+4)** The damage increases by one die."

  - name: "[[Actions/Extract Element|Extract Element]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (impulse,kineticist,primal) You extract elemental matter from a creature's body to weaken it and take its power for your own. Target a creature within 30 feet that has a trait matching one of your kinetic elements or is made of one of your kinetic elements. The target takes 1d4 untyped damage (with no damage type) and becomes susceptible to your impulses, depending on its `Fortitude check` save against your class DC.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected\n\n**Success** The creature takes half damage, and you add some of its elemental matter to your kinetic aura. Your impulses bypass any immunity the creature has to their elemental trait or traits, and the target takes a -1 circumstance penalty to its saves and AC against your impulses. If the target normally has a resistance that would apply to damage from one of your impulses, ignore that resistance; if it normally would be immune to that damage type, it instead has resistance equal to its level to damage from the impulse. You can't target a creature with Extract Element if elemental matter you extracted from it is already in your kinetic aura. These effects last for 5 minutes or until your kinetic aura ends, whichever comes first\n\n**Failure** As success, but the creature takes full damage.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature takes double damage.\n* * *\n\n**Level (+2)** The damage increases by 1d4."

  - name: "[[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (auditory,concentrate,emotion,fear,mental,skill) With a sudden shout, a well-timed taunt, or a cutting put-down, you can shake an enemy's resolve. Choose a creature within 30 feet of you who you're aware of. Attempt an Intimidation check against that target's Will DC. If the target doesn't understand the language you are speaking, or you're not speaking a language, you take a â€“4 circumstance penalty to the check. Regardless of your result, the target is temporarily immune to your attempts to Demoralize it for 10 minutes.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]].\n\n**Success** The target becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]]."
