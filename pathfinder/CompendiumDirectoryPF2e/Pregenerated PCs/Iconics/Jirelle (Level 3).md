  - name: "[[Actions/Create a Diversion|Create a Diversion]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (mental,skill) With a gesture, a trick, or some distracting words, you can create a diversion that draws creatures' attention elsewhere. If you use a gesture or trick, this action gains the manipulate trait. If you use distracting words, it gains the auditory and linguistic traits.\n\nAttempt a single Deception check and compare it to the Perception DCs of the creatures whose attention you're trying to divert. Whether or not you succeed, creatures you attempt to divert gain a +4 circumstance bonus to their Perception DCs against your attempts to Create a Diversion for 1 minute.\n* * *\n\n**Success** You become [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] to each creature whose Perception DC is less than or equal to your result. (The hidden condition allows you to [[Actions/Sneak|Sneak]] away.) This lasts until the end of your turn or until you do anything except Step or use the Stealth skill to Hide or Sneak. If you Strike a creature, the creature remains [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] against that attack, and you then become observed. If you do anything else, you become observed just before you act unless the GM determines otherwise.\n\n**Failure** You don't divert the attention of any creatures whose Perception DC exceeds your result, and those creatures are aware you were trying to trick them."

  - name: "[[Actions/Tumble Through|Tumble Through]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (move,skill) You Stride up to your Speed. During this movement, you can try to move through the space of one enemy. Attempt an Acrobatics check against the enemy's Reflex DC as soon as you try to enter its space. You can [[Actions/Tumble Through|Tumble Through]] using Climb, Fly, Swim, or another action instead of Stride in the appropriate environment.\n\n**Success** You move through the enemy's space, treating the squares in its space as difficult terrain (every 5 feet costs 10 feet of movement). If you don't have enough Speed to move all the way through its space, you get the same effect as a failure.\n\n**Failure** Your movement ends, and you trigger reactions as if you had moved out of the square you started in."

    desc: "`pf2:1` (finisher) You make an incredibly graceful attack, piercing your foe's defenses. Make a Strike with the following failure effect.\n* * *\n\n**Failure** You deal half your [[Class Features/Precise Strike|Precise Strike]] damage to the target. This damage type is that of the weapon or unarmed attack you used for the Strike."

  - name: "[[Actions/Opportune Riposte|Opportune Riposte]]"
    desc: "`pf2:r` (bravado,swashbuckler) **Trigger** A foe within your reach critically fails a Strike against you\n* * *\n\nYou take advantage of an opening from your enemy's fumbled attack. You either make a melee Strike against the triggering foe or attempt to [[Actions/Disarm|Disarm]] it of the weapon it used for the Strike."

  - name: "[[Actions/Feint|Feint]]"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (mental,skill) **Requirements** You are within melee reach of the target you attempt to Feint.\n* * *\n\nWith a misleading flourish, you leave an opponent unprepared for your real attack. Attempt a Deception check against your target's Perception DC.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** You throw your enemy's defenses against you entirely off. The target is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] against melee attacks that you attempt against it until the end of your next turn.\n\n**Success** Your foe is fooled, but only momentarily. The target is off-guard against the next melee attack that you attempt against it before the end of your current turn.\n\n**Critical Failure** Your feint backfires. You are off-guard against melee attacks the target attempts against you until the end of your next turn."
