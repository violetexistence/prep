# Alseta - Major Curse

### 






Transportation magic no longer works for you. You cannot be transported by any magical means, nor can you transport, conjure, or summon others. Even extradimensional spaces like [[Equipment/Spacious Pouch (Type I)|bags of holding]] are inaccessible and unusable to you, as using them requires magical transportation to the extradimensional space.
