You gain +4 status bonus to checks to [[Actions/Request|Request]] during attempts to satisfy one of Milani's edicts. Once per day, you can sound a battle cry that grants creatures within a 30-foot emanation the effects of [[Spells/Unfettered Movement|Unfettered Movement]] and affects all doors, locks, containers, and other bindings used to restrain or imprison others with the effects of the [[Spells/Knock|Knock]] spell.
