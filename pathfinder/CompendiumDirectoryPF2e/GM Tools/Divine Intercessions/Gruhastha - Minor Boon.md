# Gruhastha - Minor Boon

### 






Books fall open to insightful passages, and memories spring to mind when they are most needed.

Once, when you fail a check to [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]], you critically succeed instead.

Gruhastha typically grants this boon for an extremely consequential attempt to Recall Knowledge, particularly when misinformation would have dire consequences.
