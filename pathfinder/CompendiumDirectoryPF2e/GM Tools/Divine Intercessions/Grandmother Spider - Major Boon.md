# Grandmother Spider - Major Boon

### 






Grandmother Spider rejoices in freedom and tricks those who would limit it.

Any time you would become [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]], [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]], or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]], attempt a `DC 10 Flat check`. On a success, you ignore the effect, and the originator of the effect becomes grabbed, immobilized, or restrained instead. If this simply causes a creature to grab itself, it can usually [[Actions/Escape|Escape]] as a free action, but it might be stuck if it tried to immobilize you in other ways.
