# Alseta - Moderate Curse

### 






Crossing thresholds becomes daunting. Whenever you move through a portal, gateway, or door, you gain the [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]] condition. Magical travel is even more exhausting; after traveling via teleportation, [[Spells/Interplanar Teleport|Interplanar Teleport]], or the like, you also gain the [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]] condition until you get a full night's rest.
