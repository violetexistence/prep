# Nethys - Major Boon
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** deityboon; 




You are granted supreme magical knowledge and mastery.

If you are a prepared spellcaster, you can switch one of your prepared spells for another spell you could have prepared in that slot; if you are a spontaneous spellcaster, you can switch one of the spells in your spell repertoire for another spell you could have chosen for your repertoire instead.

In either case, you make this switch by using a single action, which has the concentrate trait. (If you are neither a prepared nor a spontaneous spellcaster, Nethys won't grant you his major boon.)
