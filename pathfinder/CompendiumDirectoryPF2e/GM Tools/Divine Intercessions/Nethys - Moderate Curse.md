# Nethys - Moderate Curse
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** curse; 




Your magic wars against itself like Nethys's dueling halves. Whenever you cast a spell, attempt a `DC 11 Flat check`.

On a failure, if your spell was harmful, you instead cast a beneficial spell of the same rank on your intended targets, and if it was beneficial, you instead cast a harmful spell of the same rank on your intended targets.

If the spell benefited some targets and harmed others, you cast a spell of the same rank that switches who benefited (for instance, changing a [[Spells/Heal|Heal]] spell that harmed undead and healed the living to a [[Spells/Harm|Harm]] spell that healed undead and harmed the living).

You still lose the spell slot for the spell you were trying to cast.
