# Rovagug - Moderate Boon
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** deityboon; 




You can devour all. You mouth grows into a horrible circular, insectile maw of needle-like teeth.

You gain a bite unarmed attack that deals 1d8 piercing damage.

Additionally, you can stomach eating anything you can fit down your throat-even rocks or small objects.

You gain a +4 status bonus to saves resulting from eating something, such as diseases, poisons, or other effects of the ingested object. This doesn't allow you to digest magic items that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to destroy, such as cursed items or artifacts.
