# Sivanah - Minor Boon

### 






Sivanah prevents your enemies from pulling off your veil.

Once, when a foe rolls a success on a Perception check to disbelieve your illusion, it gets a critical failure instead.

Sivanah typically grants this benefit to protect an elaborate or consequential illusory deception, and she never uses it to improve the effect of a harmful illusion.
