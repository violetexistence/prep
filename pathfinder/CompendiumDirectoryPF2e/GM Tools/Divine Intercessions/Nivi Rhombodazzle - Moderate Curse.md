# Nivi Rhombodazzle - Moderate Curse

### 






Those who arouse Nivi's wrath find themselves bound to the earth with no place to hide. You are wreathed in constant [[Spells/Faerie Fire|Faerie Fire]] and constantly affected by [[Spells/Earthbind|Earthbind]], and any effect that grants [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisibility]] doesn't work on you.
