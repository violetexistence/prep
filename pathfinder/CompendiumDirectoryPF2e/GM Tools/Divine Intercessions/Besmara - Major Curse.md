# Besmara - Major Curse

### 






You meet extreme financial ruin for daring to gravely offend the Pirate Queen. Besmara's agents steal all your booty and bring the spoils to Besmara's ship, _Seawraith_. If you want a chance to recover your lost wealth, you must parlay with the goddess and accept whatever dangerous terms she offers, usually requiring a heist she will find sufficiently amusing to watch whether you succeed or fail, and requiring you to trade your spoils from that quest for your previous belongings.
