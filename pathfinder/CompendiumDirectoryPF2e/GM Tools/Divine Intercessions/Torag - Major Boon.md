# Torag - Major Boon
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** deityboon; 




Standing watch or guarding a location counts as resting for you, preventing you from being [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]] due to lack of rest as long as you stand watch for at least 6 hours a day.

You can recover your Focus Points (if you have them) by standing guard in addition to any other options you have available.

When on guard, you gain a +4 status bonus to Perception to notice ambushes and other dangers approaching.

As long as you are holding a shield, you are always [[Actions/Defend|Defending]] during exploration without needing to move at half your travel speed, and you can perform another exploration activity as well.

While you are using a shield, its Hardness increases by 5.
