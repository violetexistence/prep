# Sivanah - Minor Curse

### 






Your hair becomes a wild variety of colors, which cannot be altered with mundane or magical means, and it somehow grows out from under any cap, scarf, or other headwear intended to disguise it. You gain a -2 status penalty to Deception skill checks to [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] anyone else.
