**Category** curse; 




Your dreams are an unending stream of nightmares. You need 16 hours of rest to try to get enough sleep to recover resources in daily preparation that normally require an 8-hour rest, and even then, you must succeed at a `DC 15 Flat check` to do so, and you are still [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]] on a successful check.
