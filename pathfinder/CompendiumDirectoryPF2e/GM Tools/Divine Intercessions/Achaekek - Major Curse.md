# Achaekek - Major Curse

### 






The Mantis God doesn't waste his time toying with or tormenting those who truly anger him or those who dare to consider themselves divine. He rips open a portal to your location, kills you, drags your soul to judgment in a way that prevents resurrection magic, and then leaves.
