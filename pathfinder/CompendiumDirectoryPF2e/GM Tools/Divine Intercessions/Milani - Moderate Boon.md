# Milani - Moderate Boon

### 






When you use it to protect others, your shield blooms with roses brimming with razor-sharp thorns. You gain the [[Feats/Shield Warden|Shield Warden (Fighter)]] feat, even if you don't meet its prerequisites. If you already had that feat, if your shield takes damage from a melee Strike in defense of your ally, the attacker takes piercing damage equal to half the shield's Hardness.
