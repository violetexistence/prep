# Tsukiyo - Moderate Curse

### 






If Tsukiyo is particularly offended by someone, they may find themselves lost in delusions of moonlight. When attempting to navigate or find something at night, if you roll a success or critical success on your Perception check, Survival check, or other check to do so, you get a failure instead.
