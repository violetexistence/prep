# Torag - Major Curse
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** curse; 




You are forever cast out from your home. Members of your community have their attitudes towards you shift two steps worse, meaning those who used to be helpful are now indifferent, those who were friendly are now unfriendly, and all others are now hostile. This doesn't necessarily result in violence, but hostile community members generally seek your permanent exile.
