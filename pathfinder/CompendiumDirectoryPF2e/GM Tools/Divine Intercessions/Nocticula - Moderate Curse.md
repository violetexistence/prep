# Nocticula - Moderate Curse

### 






You are plagued with doubt in your own skills. You are always untrained with Crafting, Performance, and one other skill (determined by the GM, but themed to the event that brought on your curse), regardless of any effect that would improve your proficiency. You can't retrain those skills.
