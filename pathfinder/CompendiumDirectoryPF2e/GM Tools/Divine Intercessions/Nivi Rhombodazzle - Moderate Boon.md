# Nivi Rhombodazzle - Moderate Boon

### 






Nivi bestows a fraction of her skill at pushing consequences down the road. Once per day, after attempting a check, you can roll a second time. You must use the result of the second roll, even if it is worse. This is a fortune effect. At any point after you use this boon, the GM can replace one of your check results with the first result of the check you attempted when using this boon; this delayed result can't be further delayed, prevented, or affected in any way, even by other divine intercessions.
