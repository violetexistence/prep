# Groetus - Major Curse

### 






You bring about the end to everything around you. Every item you carry or wear gains the [[Conditions/Broken|Broken]] condition after 10 minutes of exposure to you, and is destroyed after a further hour. This effect can't destroy artifacts or items of similar power.
