# Brigh - Major Curse

### 






Constructs—even mindless constructs you thought you could control—seek your demise. All constructs are hostile to you and attack you when they notice your presence. Occasionally, inanimate statues and other objects animate as constructs to pursue Brigh's vengeance.
