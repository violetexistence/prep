# Abadar - Moderate Curse
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** curse; 




Abadar curses all your enterprises, leading to financial disaster as all your ventures always seem to fail. The result of your check to [[Actions/Earn Income|Earn Income]] is always one degree of success worse than the one you rolled.
