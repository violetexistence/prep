# Cayden Cailean - Moderate Boon
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** deityboon; 




You share some of the bravery Cayden espoused during his ascension.

When you roll a success on a saving throw against a fear effect, you get a critical success instead. If you have the fighter [[Class Features/Bravery|Bravery]] class feature, when you roll a critical failure on a save against a fear effect, you get a failure instead.
