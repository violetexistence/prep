# Desna - Moderate Curse
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** curse; 




Misfortune follows you in your travels and requires acts of contrition or benevolence to keep at bay.

You must always roll twice and take the worst result when attempting a check. This is a misfortune effect.

You can express your remorse and ignore this effect for 1d4 rounds by spending an action, which has the concentrate trait.

If you perform a truly selfless act of compassion, you ignore this effect for 1 day.
