# Nivi Rhombodazzle - Major Curse

### 






Nivi curses unworthy adherents with recklessness. Any time you are presented with a wager, you are compelled to accept, no matter the odds. If you succeed at a `DC 40 Will check` save, you can at least attempt to alter the stakes of that wager in your favor, but you must still accept.
