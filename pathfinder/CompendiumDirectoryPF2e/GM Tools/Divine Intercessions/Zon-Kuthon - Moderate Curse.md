# Zon-Kuthon - Moderate Curse
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** curse; 




You share the pain of others, and even minor wounds bring you incredible pain.

Whenever you see (or otherwise sense) a creature take damage, you take 1d6 mental damage.

Whenever you take damage any other way than from the first part of this curse, you take 1d6 mental damage from increased pain and are [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]]. Mental damage from this curse ignores any resistance you have to mental damage.
