# Sarenrae - Major Curse
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** curse; 




Sarenrae restricts your ability to harm others.

All attacks you make, spells you cast, and other sources of damage you deal are nonlethal except against fiends and undead, and you can't ever make them lethal.

You deal minimum damage except against fiends and undead.

All creatures except fiends and undead gain a +4 status bonus to their AC and saving throws against your attacks and other effects.
