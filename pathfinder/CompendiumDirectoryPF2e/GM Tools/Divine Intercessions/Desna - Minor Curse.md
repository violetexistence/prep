# Desna - Minor Curse
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** curse; 




You always seem to lose your way or have strange mishaps on the road that delay your travel.

You (and thus any group that travels with you) travel at only 3/4 normal exploration Speed, before taking into account the terrain and other features that might slow you down further.
