# Grandmother Spider - Minor Boon

### 






Grandmother Spider rescues your prank from the jaws of failure.

Once, when you would fail a Deception check, you critically succeed instead.

Grandmother Spider typically grants this boon for deceptions that are necessary for an interesting or consequential prank.
