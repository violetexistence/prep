# Nivi Rhombodazzle - Major Boon

### 






Those who have done much to please Nivi find themselves slipping from sight when needed.

Any time you attempt a Stealth check to [[Actions/Hide|Hide]] or [[Actions/Sneak|Sneak]], you also gain the effects of 2nd-rank [[Spells/Invisibility|Invisibility]] and [[Spells/Fleet Step|Fleet Step]] spells to help you elude your enemies. These effects last until the end of your next turn or until you stop Hiding or Sneaking, whichever comes first (you can continue to Hide or Sneak, turn after turn, to extend these effects).
