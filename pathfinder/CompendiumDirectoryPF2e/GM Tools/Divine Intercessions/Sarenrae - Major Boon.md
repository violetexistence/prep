# Sarenrae - Major Boon
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** deityboon; 




You are a voice of peace and rehabilitation.

When you roll a success at a check to [[Actions/Request|Request]] something, you get a critical success instead.

In addition, all creatures other than fiends, undead, and mindless creatures allow you one chance to speak your piece and make requests before entering combat. If you or an ally ever use the time from the request to gain an advantage in an ensuing combat (for example, by casting preparatory spells, positioning for combat, or waiting out your opponent's preparatory spells), Sarenrae immediately revokes this boon, or possibly curses your ally.
