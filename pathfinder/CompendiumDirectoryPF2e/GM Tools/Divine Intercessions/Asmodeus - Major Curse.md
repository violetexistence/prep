# Asmodeus - Major Curse
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** curse; 




Asmodeus has taken note of the chaos you have wrought. You receive an ancient wound that feels older than time itself. You become permanently [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 4]], and nothing short of another intercession can remove the condition.

Your wound aches fiercely whenever you perform a particularly chaotic act, causing you to become [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]].
