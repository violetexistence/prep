# Tsukiyo - Moderate Boon

### 






Tsukiyo watches over you and guards your sleep. You are guaranteed a peaceful night's rest no matter what conditions you are sleeping in. Even nightmare and similar abilities can't disrupt your sleep unless they come from a deity, artifact, or similarly powerful source.
