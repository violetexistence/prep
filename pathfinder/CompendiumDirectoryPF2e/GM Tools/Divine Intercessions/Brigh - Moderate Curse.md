# Brigh - Moderate Curse

### 






Whenever you try to perform engineering or science tasks, everything just seems to explode. Whenever you attempt to create or use an alchemical item or a construct, [[Actions/Disable a Device|Disable a Device]], and so on, you must attempt a `DC 15 Flat check`. On a failure, something explodes and you take 1d6 fire damage (or a different type of damage, if appropriate) per level of the item, construct, or device (`DC 40 Reflex check` save).
