# Lamashtu - Minor Boon
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** deityboon; 




Lamashtu's touch mutates a part of your body.

You gain either an unarmed Strike that deals 1d6 damage or one that deals 1d4 damage and has the finesse and agile traits.

Whether the attack deals bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing damage depends on the mutation.

If the unarmed Strike replaces a limb, you can still use the mutated limb for its original functions. Lamashtu chooses the form and function of your mutation.
