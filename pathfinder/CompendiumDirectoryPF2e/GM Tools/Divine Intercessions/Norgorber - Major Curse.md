# Norgorber - Major Curse
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** curse; 




Norgorber steals away your memories.

Once each day when you awake from rest, roll 1d4.

On a 1, you forget the events of the previous day forever.

On a 2, you temporarily experience complete retrograde amnesia for that day, unable to recall information from the past, including who you are.

On a 3, you temporarily forget a single important subject for that day (Norgorber tends to intentionally chooses a memory to cause distress, such as making you forget your spouse on your anniversary).

On a 4, you temporarily remember false memories on a single important subject for that day, blended seamlessly into your true memories.
