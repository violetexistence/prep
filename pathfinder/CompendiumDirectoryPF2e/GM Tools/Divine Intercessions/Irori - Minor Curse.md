# Irori - Minor Curse
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** deityboon; 




Irori challenges you to seek another path, rather than treat every problem as a nail just because you have a hammer. If you select a check for which you have a higher bonus when another method would have been more appropriate for the situation, such as using Deception to [[Actions/Lie|Lie]] through life because it's your highest modifier, even if it would be better to reach a compromise through Diplomacy, you must roll twice and take the lower result.
