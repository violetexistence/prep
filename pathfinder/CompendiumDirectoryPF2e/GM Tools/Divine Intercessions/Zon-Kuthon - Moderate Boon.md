# Zon-Kuthon - Moderate Boon
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** deityboon; 




Each morning, during your daily preparations, scars gather into words on your flesh.

The scars function as a scroll of a divine spell of Zon-Kuthon's choosing.

After you use the scroll or receive magical healing, the boon fades for the day, though some or all of the scars might remain as a reminder.
