# Grandmother Spider - Major Curse

### 






Grandmother Spider throws all of her might behind the underdog. Any time a creature with a level lower than yours rolls a success on a check against you, it critically succeeds instead; any time you roll a failure on a check against a creature with a level lower than yours, you critically fail instead.
