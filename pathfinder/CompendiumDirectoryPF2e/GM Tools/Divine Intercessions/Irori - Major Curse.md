# Irori - Major Curse

Irori makes all living creatures forget your existence. This can be further compounded by raising Irori's ire, resulting in your name being obliterated from all written records. In both cases, memories and writings rearrange themselves to omit you smoothly, rather than leaving obvious gaps.
