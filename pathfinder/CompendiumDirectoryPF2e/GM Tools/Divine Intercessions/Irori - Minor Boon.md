# Irori - Minor Boon
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** deityboon; 




Irori grants you great insight and knowledge.

Once, when you roll a failure at a check to [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]], you get a critical success instead. Furthermore, the check loses the secret trait, so you know for sure that the result was a critical success.

Irori typically grants this boon for an extremely consequential check to Recall Knowledge.
