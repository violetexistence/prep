# Brigh - Major Boon

### 






You gain the companionship of a loyal construct ally of Brigh's choice at least 1 level lower than you. If the construct is destroyed, it rebuilds itself over the course of a week, and as you gain levels, the construct upgrades and improves itself, becoming more powerful.
