# Abadar - Minor Curse
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** curse; 




Any time you steal, illegally harm or kill another creature, or undermine a law-abiding officer or court, a symbol or word describing your crime appears on a visible spot on your skin. This symbol cannot be removed or hidden with makeup (though it can be covered with clothing) and it doesn't vanish until you make legal restitution for the crime, such as by serving your sentence.
