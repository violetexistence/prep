# Tsukiyo - Major Curse

### 






When Tsukiyo truly loses patience with someone, he forces them to experience the hardships of others firsthand. Whenever you touch another creature or another creature touches you, you immediately gain any negative curses, diseases, and conditions they are suffering. These effects spread to you even when you Strike another creature or a creature Strikes you.
