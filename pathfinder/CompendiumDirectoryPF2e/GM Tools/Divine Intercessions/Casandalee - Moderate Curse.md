# Casandalee - Moderate Curse

### 






Casandalee attempts to bring you unwanted intellectual advancement to help you become something better. Each day, at some point during the day, Casandalee bestows a strange insight upon you that you find uncomfortable. If you embrace it, you aren't otherwise affected, but if you don't, you become [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]] for 10 minutes.
