## Feat 1
### 

**Category** deityboon; 




Abadar blesses all your enterprises, leading to financial success as all your ventures always seems to work out.

If you roll a critical failure at a check to [[Actions/Earn Income|Earn Income]], you get a failure instead.

If you roll a success on a check to Earn Income, you earn twice the usual amount of income.
