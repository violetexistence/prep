# Groetus - Major Boon

### 






Your touch unravels things that have survived past their appointed time, according to Groetus's reckoning.

Such a creature or object takes 10d6 void damage each round you continue touching it; the damage ignores all Hardness and is capable of destroying nonliving objects, creatures immune to void effects, and even undead or other creatures with void healing. This boon might even be able to destroy some artifacts that have survived past their time.
