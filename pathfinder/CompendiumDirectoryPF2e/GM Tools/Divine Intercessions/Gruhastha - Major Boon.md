# Gruhastha - Major Boon

### 






You are a divine inspiration to others around you.

When attempting any checks to [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]], you can roll twice and use the better result; this is a fortune effect. Additionally, allies within 60 feet gain a +2 status bonus to Will saves.
