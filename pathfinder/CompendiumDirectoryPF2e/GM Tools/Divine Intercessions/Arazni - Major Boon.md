# Arazni - Major Boon

### 






Upon death, you return to life with the effects of a critical success on a [[Spells/Resurrect|Resurrect]] ritual to enact vengeance against your killers. When you successfully achieve vengeance, abandon your vengeance for other pursuits, or fail outright, you crumble to scarlet dust.
