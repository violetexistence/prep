# Rovagug - Minor Curse
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** curse; 




Whenever you are imprisoned, you thrash and shake as your mind fills with desperation.

Any time you are restrained or otherwise imprisoned (such as being sent to jail), you are also [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 2]] and [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 2]].
