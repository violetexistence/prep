# Casandalee - Minor Boon

### 






Casandalee frees your thinking from dangerous control.

Once, when you fail a Will save against an effect that would control your actions, you critically succeed instead.

Casandalee typically grants this boon for particularly consequential violations of autonomy and agency.
