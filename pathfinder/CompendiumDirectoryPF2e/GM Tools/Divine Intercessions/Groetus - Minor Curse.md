# Groetus - Minor Curse

### 






Whenever you are illuminated by a light source other than natural sunlight, your head appears to be a bare skull. The DC for your recovery checks is 12 + your dying value, rather than 10 + your dying value, and you don't benefit from effects that reduce the DC, such as from the [[Feats/Toughness|Toughness]] feat.
