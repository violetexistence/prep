# Gozreh - Moderate Curse
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** curse; 




The current of the waves constantly fights against you, putting you at risk of drowning any time you must [[Actions/Swim|Swim]].

You lose any swim Speed you have, unless it's your only Speed, in which case you take a -20-foot status penalty to your swim Speed.

When you roll an Athletics check to Swim, you always use the outcome for one degree of success worse than the result of your roll.
