# Hei Feng - Minor Boon

### 






The Heavenly Court's most boastful deity ensures your boasts hit home.

Once, when you fail an Intimidation check, you critically succeed instead.

Hei Feng grants this boon capriciously based on his mood, sometimes even for trivial or inconsequential boasts, and he sometimes grants it for other skill checks related to boasts.
