# Sivanah - Major Boon

### 






You spread your illusions over a larger area.

You can designate an area to permanently gain the effects of [[Spells/Mirage|Mirage]]. All creatures within this area gain the effects of [[Spells/Illusory Disguise|Illusory Disguise]], changing their forms as you wish. You can designate a new area as a 1-minute activity, but doing so dismisses any previously designated areas.
