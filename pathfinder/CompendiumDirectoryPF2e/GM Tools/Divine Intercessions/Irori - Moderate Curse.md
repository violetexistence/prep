## Feat 1
### 

**Category** deityboon; 




Irori challenges you to adapt to adversity in order to perfect yourself. You become weighed down as if under heavy weights, becoming [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 2]] and [[Conditions/Encumbered|Encumbered]] until you accomplish a challenging task of Irori's choosing.
