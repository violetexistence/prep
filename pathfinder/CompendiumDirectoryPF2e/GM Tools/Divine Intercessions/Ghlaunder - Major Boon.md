# Ghlaunder - Major Boon

### 






Ghlaunder rewards his followers with the ability to safely spread illnessâ€”or on occasion, offers respite to desperate petitioners who please him.

You do not take negative effects from any disease you are infected with unless or until Ghlaunder rescinds this benefit.
