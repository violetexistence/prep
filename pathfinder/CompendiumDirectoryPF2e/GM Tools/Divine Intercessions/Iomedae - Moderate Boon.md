# Iomedae - Moderate Boon
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** deityboon; 




Your heart beats with a determined valor.

Once, Iomedae ends all negative effects affecting you, unless they are from an artifact, deity, or similarly powerful source; she also restores all lost Hit Points and replenishes your spells, Focus Points, and other daily resources.
