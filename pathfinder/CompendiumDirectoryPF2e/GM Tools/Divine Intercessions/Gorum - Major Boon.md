# Gorum - Major Boon
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** deityboon; 




Gorum feeds you the zeal of his undying warriors, allowing you to draw upon your own life force to fight on and on without falling.

Whenever you would be reduced to 0 Hit Points, you are instead healed to half your maximum Hit Points and become [[Conditions/Doomed|Doomed 1]] (or increase your doomed condition by 1).
