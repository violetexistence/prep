# Abadar - Minor Boon
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** deityboon; 




Abadar warns his favored against those who might unfairly take advantage.

Once, when someone rolls a success on a Deception check to [[Actions/Lie|Lie]] maliciously to you and you alone, they get a critical failure instead.

Abadar typically chooses to grant this boon in response to an extremely consequential lie.
