# Pharasma - Moderate Curse
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** curse; 




Fate turns against you and reveals dire portents. Divinations such as [[Spells/Augury|Augury]] cast by you or that involve you always suggest woe. Once per day after you attempt a check, the GM can make the result of the roll a natural 1.
