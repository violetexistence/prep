# Kazutal - Major Boon

### 






Kazutal smiles upon those who seek to offer aid, no matter how meek or helpless they may be.

Any time creatures attempt a check to [[Actions/Aid|Aid]] you, they can choose to automatically succeed. If a creature chooses to roll for the attempt and rolls a success, it gets a critical success instead, granting a +4 circumstance bonus even if it doesn't have legendary proficiency in that skill. You gain the same benefits when you attempt to Aid others.
