# Calistria - Moderate Curse
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** curse; 




People react as though you're insulting them, even in normal conversation. Whenever you attempt to [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]], the outcome is one degree of success worse than the result of your roll. If you converse with someone over a long enough period of time but don't attempt to Make an Impression, you still insult them, and you suffer the effect of a critical failure to Make an Impression.
