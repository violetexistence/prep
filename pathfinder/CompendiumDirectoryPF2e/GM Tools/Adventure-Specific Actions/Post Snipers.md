# Post Snipers

### [[downtime]][[manipulate]]

**Category** defensive; 




The Narlmarch Wardens are skilled hunters, but by taking a few of these archers out of the army's ranks and posting them on [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] locations on rooftops or in trees throughout the battlefield, the PCs can maximize their potential.

* * *

**Critical Success** The snipers are posted in several key positions. At the end of a turn during the Battle for Tatzlford, attempt a +18 ranged Strike against any army that is not engaged. The snipers deal 1 point of damage on a hit (2 points on a critical hit). The snipers can perform this bonus attack up to 3 times during the Battle for Tatzlford, but no more than once at the end of any one turn.

**Success** As critical success, but the snipers can perform the bonus attack only once during the battle.

**Critical Failure** Not only are the snipers posted in areas that end up not proving advantageous, but the PCs drew too many archers from the ranks. The Narlmarch Hunters suffer a -2 penalty on ranged attacks during the Battle for Tatzlford.
