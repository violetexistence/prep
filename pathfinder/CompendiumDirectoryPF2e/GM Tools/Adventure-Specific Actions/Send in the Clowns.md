# Send in the Clowns `pf2:1`

### [[circus]]

**Category** interaction; 




**Requirements** You or another performer has failed or critically failed a trick check during the current act.

* * *

You give the signal for the circus's clown troupe to come onstage and rescue a botched trick. A failed trick becomes a success instead, or if it was a critical failure, it is instead a failure. The clowns can be sent in only once per act, and only one trick check is affected.
