You tap into your bond with Little Ripple to temporarily manifest the water elemental. A sphere of semi-tangible water surrounds you, which magically purifies your spirit and purges toxins from your body. Little Ripple attempts to counteract a single disease or poison you are affected by with a counteract modifier of +21 and a counteract rank of 10. Little Ripple's presence has a soothing effect on your spirit. You gain a +1 status bonus to Will saves for 1 minute.
