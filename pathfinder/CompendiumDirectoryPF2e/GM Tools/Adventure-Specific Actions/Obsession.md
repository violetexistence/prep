# Obsession
## Feat 1
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[occult]]

**Category** deityboon; 




This spirit power represents an extreme fixation on a particular object. While this is most often a result of insatiable greed, this could also represent fondness for a cherished heirloom or attachment to a defining piece of art that a person created. This focus is appropriate for a character particularly attached to their wealth or to a particular piece of gear. It expresses itself as an ability to telekinetically control small objects. You can cast [[Spells/Telekinetic Projectile|Telekinetic Projectile]] at will as an innate occult spell.

Once per day, you can cast one of the following spells as a 5th-rank innate occult spell: [[Spells/Animate Rope|Animate Rope]], [[Spells/Animated Assault|Animated Assault]], or [[Spells/Telekinetic Haul|Telekinetic Haul]].
