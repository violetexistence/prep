# Position the Hunters

### [[exploration]]

**Category** interaction; 




With the target game animals located, you must move to an advantageous position without startling the prey. Attempt a Stealth check.

*   Against an impressive and dangerous find: `DC 25 Stealth check`
*   Against standard game: `DC 20 Stealth check`
*   Against river turtles, bats, and lesser game: `DC 15 Stealth check`

**Critical Success** The animals have no indication that they are in danger, and you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to rolls made during the hunting phase.

**Success** You position yourself well and take no penalty when Hunting.

**Failure** Your loud and clumsy movements alert the animals to your presence, and you take a -2 circumstance penalty to rolls made during the hunting phase.

**Critical Failure** You stumble loudly and startle the majority of the animals, which escape and leave the party with very few animals to catch. The party loses 2 IP.
