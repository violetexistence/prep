# Curiosity `pf2:2`
## Feat 1
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[linguistic]][[mental]][[occult]]

**Category** deityboon; 




A desire for knowledge can be a powerful motivation. This focus also commonly manifests in young or otherwise innocent spirits, as they're bound mainly by a desire to see the world a little longer. You reach out to touch an adjacent living target, and for a moment, your hand becomes incorporeal as it passes through their body. The target must attempt a `Will check` save, after which they're immune to this power.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** You perceive vague surface thoughts from the target and find out whether its Intelligence modifier is higher than, equal to, or lower than yours.

**Failure** As success, but you can probe into the target's mind and attempt to uncover the answer to a question you telepathically pose to them. The target can attempt a `Deception check` check against your spirit power's DC; if the target succeeds, you don't learn the answer, and on a critical success, the target gives you a false answer you believe is truthful.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but once you resolve the telepathic question and its answer, the target loses all memory of this event.
