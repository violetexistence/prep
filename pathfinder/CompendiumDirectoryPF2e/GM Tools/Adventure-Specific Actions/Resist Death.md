# Resist Death
## Feat 1
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[occult]]

**Category** deityboon; 




Your spirit is so single-minded in its purpose that even obliteration of your transmigrated body isn't enough to stop them. The next time you are reduced to 0 Hit Points within the next 24 hours, you are instead reduced to 10 Hit Points and are exposed to Soul Degradation.
