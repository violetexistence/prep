# Clean

### [[downtime]][[manipulate]]

**Category** interaction; 




You spend the day cleaning-hauling out broken furniture, disposing of detritus, and making rooms clear enough to begin repairs. Citadel Altaerein requires 8 days of cleaning before any other basic repair activities can begin. Cleaning does not require a Crafting check, nor does it cost gold.
