# Haul Supplies

### [[exploration]][[move]]

**Category** interaction; 




You pack up as many supplies as you can carry and make your way back to Bazal's Basin with food and water. Attempt a `DC 34 Athletics check` check to determine the amount and quality of the food you manage to haul and keep safe from being damaged in the storm. A character who uses powerful magic (such as teleport) to aid in transporting the food automatically achieves a result one category higher than they roll.

**Critical Success** You return with 15 Bulk of supplies.

**Success** You return with 10 Bulk of supplies.

**Failure** Some of the food was damaged in transport, and you return with only 5 Bulk of supplies.

**Critical Failure** All of the supplies you attempted to transport are ruined.
