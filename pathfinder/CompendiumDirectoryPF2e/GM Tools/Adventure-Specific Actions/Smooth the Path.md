# Smooth the Path

### [[exploration]]

**Category** interaction; 




**Requirement** The PC has successfully infiltrated the estate.

* * *

Now that they're on the inside, the PC helps an ally who's still trying to infiltrate. They describe what they're doing to help, and give the ally the benefits of [[Actions/Follow the Expert|Following the Expert]]. The GM might require the PC to attempt a relevant skill check (typically DC 32) to Smooth the Path.
