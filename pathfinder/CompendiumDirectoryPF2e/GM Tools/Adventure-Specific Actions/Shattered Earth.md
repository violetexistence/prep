# Shattered Earth `pf2:2`

### [[earth]]

**Category** offensive; 




**Aspect** earth

**Activate** `pf2:2` command, Interact

**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

**Effect** Seismic pulses from your relic ripple through the nearby ground, shaking sharp fragments to the surface. A 10-foot-radius patch of stone or earth within 60 feet is transformed into difficult terrain. A creature that enters an affected square during a move action must succeed at an Acrobatics check or Reflex save or take 1d6 piercing damage; it needs to roll only once per move action even if it moves through several squares. At 6th level and every 4 levels thereafter, increase the damage by 1d6.
