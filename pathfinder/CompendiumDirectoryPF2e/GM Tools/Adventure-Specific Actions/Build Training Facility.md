# Build Training Facility

### [[downtime]][[manipulate]]

**Category** interaction; 




**Requirements** expert in the skill listed below or hired trainer; organized specialists

* * *

Pick a room in Citadel Altaerein to serve as a training area for a single character class (you can have multiple training facilities, with each one devoted to a different class). Once complete, the training facility fills the role of a teacher when using the Retrain downtime activity for the chosen class, and reduces the time required to retrain a feat or skill increase by 2 days and the time required to retrain a class feature by 1 week. This upgrade takes 40 days of work.

Building the facility requires a DC 25 skill check using a skill depending on the class in question, as listed below. If a class lists multiple skills, the PC can choose whichever one they like (but they must be an expert in the chosen skill, as noted in the Requirements entry above).

*   Alchemist `DC 25 Crafting check`
*   Barbarian `DC 25 Athletics check`
*   Bard `DC 25 Occultism check` or `DC 25 Performance check`
*   Champion `DC 25 Religion check`
*   Cleric `DC 25 Religion check`
*   Druid `DC 25 Nature check`
*   Fighter `DC 25 Acrobatics check` or `DC 25 Athletics check`
*   Monk `DC 25 Acrobatics check` or `DC 25 Athletics check`
*   Ranger `DC 25 Athletics check`, `DC 25 Nature check`, or `DC 25 Survival check`
*   Rogue `DC 25 Acrobatics check` or `DC 25 Thievery check`
*   Sorcerer `DC 25 Arcana check`, `DC 25 Nature check`, `DC 25 Occultism check`, or `DC 25 Religion check`
*   Wizard `DC 25 Arcana check`
