# Blend In

### [[exploration]]

**Category** interaction; 




**Overcome** `DC 35 Deception check`, `DC 37 Society check`, `DC 35 Stealth check`

* * *

Sometimes the best option for crossing a crowded party is to act natural and join the crowd.

If a PC successfully Blends In, roll a secret `DC 34 Perception check` for them to notice that something seems off about one of the guests. On a success, inform them about the Dispel a Disguise Opportunity.
