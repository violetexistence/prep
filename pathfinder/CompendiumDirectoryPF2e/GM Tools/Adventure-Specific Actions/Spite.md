# Spite `pf2:2`
## Feat 1
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[curse]][[occult]]

**Category** deityboon; 




Even if a person was kind in life, the dead have many reasons to spite the living, and the violent grudges of the departed are why ghosts are so often feared. This focus isn't just fueled by hate; righteous fury can empower these abilities, though even the most virtuous of feelings can become twisted over time. Spite takes the form of curses, punishing the target with various bodily maladies. Point to a target you can see within 30 feet. The target must then attempt a `Will check` saving throw, after which they're immune to this power.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target's skin itches uncontrollably. If the target doesn't spend an action to scratch at the itch, they become [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the start of their next turn. This effect lasts for 1 minute.

**Failure** The target's skin breaks out in painful lesions and unsightly sores. The victim becomes [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 2]], [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 2]], and [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 2]] for 24 hours.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target is also [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] for the duration.
