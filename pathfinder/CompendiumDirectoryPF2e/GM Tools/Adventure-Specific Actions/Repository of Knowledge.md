Your relic is imbued with the psychic impressions of ages past. While the relic is on your person, you are trained in 3 additional Lore skills of the GM's choice that fit the relic's history, decided at the time of gaining this gift. If the relic is 9th level, you instead have expert proficiency in these Lore skills, and if the relic is 17th level, you have master proficiency in these Lore skills.
