# Grudge `pf2:1`
## Feat 1
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[emotion]][[fear]][[incapacitation]][[mental]][[occult]]

**Category** deityboon; 




Your hatred is so powerful that it can overwhelm another's mind. Choose a creature within 30 feet of you that's aware of you. That creature sees your expression suddenly transform into a supernaturally distorted visage of hatred, and must attempt a `Will check` save. Since this perception of your hatred is all perceived directly in the target's mind, it does not have the visual traitâ€”if the target can't see you, your hatred manifests in different ways that the target will have no problem observing. Perhaps your voice manifests as a sinister whisper in their ears, or maybe you flood them with a scent that invokes a horrific memory. The creature is then immune to Grudge for 24 hours.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]]

**Failure** The creature becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]], falls [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] from the shock, and is [[Conditions/Fleeing|Fleeing]] as long as it remains frightened.

**Critical Failure** The creature faints from fear, becoming [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]]. It becomes frightened 2 and is fleeing as soon as it is no longer unconscious.
