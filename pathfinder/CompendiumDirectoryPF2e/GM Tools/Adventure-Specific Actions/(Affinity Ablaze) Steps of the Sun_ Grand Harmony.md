# (Affinity Ablaze) Steps of the Sun: Grand Harmony `pf2:2`

### [[concentrate]][[emotion]][[magical]]






**Frequency** once per day

* * *

There are few bonds like those between fighters who have shared blows in an arena, and in so doing, come to understand each other. You focus on your emotional connection to one of the other tournament teams, and their power roars along it to you like a string set alight. You use the following ability, which you must have gained access to from the original team.

Your heart harmonizes with those of your comrades before pounding once in a devastating shock wave. You deal 18d4 sonic damage in a 60-foot cone. Enemies can attempt a `Fortitude check` save with a DC equal to your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. If you are adjacent to at least 1 ally, this deals 18d6, if you are adjacent to at least 2 allies, this deals 18d8.
