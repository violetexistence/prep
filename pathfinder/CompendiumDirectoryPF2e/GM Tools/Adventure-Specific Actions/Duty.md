# Duty `pf2:2`
## Feat 1
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[incapacitation]][[linguistic]][[mental]][[occult]]

**Category** deityboon; 




Stoic resolve or plain stubbornness form the core of this focus. While the dead can't demand their flesh persist beyond their time, they can still impose some of their iron will on other people. This focus expresses itself as an ability to whisper in the ears of the living. You whisper to a target within 30 feet that you can see. The target must then attempt a `Will check` saving throw, after which they're immune to this power.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target hears your whispered words but isn't otherwise affected.

**Success** The target is unnerved by your whispered words, and becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]].

**Failure** The target hears your whispered words and must obey your suggested course of action for 1 minute, until it has completed the task, or until the task becomes self-destructive or has other obvious negative effects. Your suggested course of action must be phrased in such a way as to seem like a logical course of action to the target.

**Critical Failure** As failure but the base duration is 1 hour.
