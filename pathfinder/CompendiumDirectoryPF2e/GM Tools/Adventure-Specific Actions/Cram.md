# Cram

### [[downtime]]

**Category** interaction; 




**Requirements** You are an initiate, attendant, or conversant, and your branch level for either your primary or secondary branch is 2 or more levels below the limit.

* * *

Realizing that you're falling behind in your studies, you cram more than you probably should. You Study twice, each in a branch that satisfies the activity requirements. However, the extra studying comes at a price. Until the next time you take the Study downtime activity, you're particularly tired from all the extra hours cramming; at the start of each day of adventuring, you must succeed at a `DC 8 Flat check` check or be [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]] for that day.
