# Contact Steel Falcons

### [[downtime]]

**Category** interaction; 




**Overcome** `DC 32 Andoran Lore check`, `DC 36 Diplomacy check`, `DC 34 Society check`

* * *

The PC surreptitiously tries to contact the Steel Falcons in Katapesh.

* * *

**Success** The PC arranges a meeting with the Steel Falcons. They're eager to combine forces with powerful operatives like the PCs in the name of liberating the oppressed, and they can provide information about the upcoming auction equivalent to a Gather Information success. In addition, the Steel Falcons grant the PCs 1 Edge Point.

**Failure** The PC fails to make contact.

**Critical Failure** The PC's clumsy attempt spooks the Steel Falcons. Future attempts at this activity take a -2 circumstance penalty.

* * *

**Special** If the PCs don't succeed at this Opportunity, the Steel Falcons independently decide to launch their own heist that overlaps with-and potentially interferes with-the PCs' heist.
