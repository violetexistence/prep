# Deadly Traps

### [[exploration]]

**Category** interaction; 




**Overcome** 2 successes; `DC 34 Arcana check` or `DC 34 Thievery check`

* * *

The PCs suppress or disable dangerous traps set to kill would-be thieves and make an explosive ruckus.

**Special** If a PC fails a check to overcome this scene, they trigger a trap that deals 16d6 untyped damage to that PC (`DC 36 Reflex check`). If the PC critically fails, it deals this damage to all PCs in the scene.
