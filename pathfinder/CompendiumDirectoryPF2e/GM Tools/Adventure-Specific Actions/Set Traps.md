# Set Traps

### [[downtime]][[manipulate]]

**Category** defensive; 




By setting a number of quickly built traps in the surrounding woods or in narrow alleys, the PCs can impede the attackers' movement and even injure some of them. Setting Traps requires a Survival (trained) check.

**Critical Success** At the end of each turn during the Battle for Tatzlford, one enemy army of the PCs' choice becomes mired 1 and takes 1 point of damage.

**Critical Failure** The attempt to set traps not only fails, but one of them misfires spectacularly during setup: An attempt to rig a timber covered with spikes fails, smashing the PC against a building wall. That PC takes 5d6 piercing and 5d6 bludgeoning damage (`DC 25 Reflex check`).
