# Erect Barricades

### [[downtime]][[manipulate]]

**Category** defensive; 




Open gaps in the walls, in alleys, or even on streets can be fortified with barricades to prevent easy passage into town, using lumber, trees, barrels, wagons, rubbish, and even sharpened poles. Erecting a Barricade requires a Crafting check. This activity can be performed by more than one PC to create more than one barricade.

* * *

**Critical Success** The barricade is a success. When a defending army takes the Guard action, it gains a +2 item bonus on its Maneuver check. A barricade can grant this bonus only twice before it is ruined by enemy attacks.

**Success** As critical success, but the barricade only works for one Guard action.

**Critical Failure** A catastrophic accident occurs! Not only is the barricade ruined, but the PC attempting to erect the barricade takes 10d6 bludgeoning damage (`DC 25 Reflex check`).
