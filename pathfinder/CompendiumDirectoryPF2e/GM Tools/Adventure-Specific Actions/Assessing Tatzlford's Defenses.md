# Assessing Tatzlford's Defenses

### [[concentrate]][[downtime]]

**Category** defensive; 




The party takes an hour to tour Tatzlford to assess potential improvements to the town's defenses. They automatically come to the conclusion that erecting barricades will help, giving them access to the Erect Barricades activity below. Attempt a single DC 23 Defense check or DC 27 Warfare kingdom check to identify additional defensive improvements, potentially allowing access to the Post Snipers, Prepare Firepots, Recruit Wildlife, or Set Traps activities below. If the players come up with any of those ideas on their own (or at your discretion, similar enough ideas) they gain access to the corresponding activity regardless of the check result.

* * *

**Critical Success** The party gains all four additional defensive actions.

**Success** The party gains two additional defensive actions, determined randomly.

**Failure** The party gains one additional defensive action, determined randomly.

**Critical Failure** Only the Erect Barricades defense suggests itself to the PCs.
