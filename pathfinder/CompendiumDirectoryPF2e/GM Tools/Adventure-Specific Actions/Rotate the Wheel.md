# Rotate the Wheel `pf2:3`

### [[manipulate]]

**Category** interaction; 




The character takes time to rotate the wheel. Doing so is exhausting, and at the end of a round the PC must attempt a `DC 25 Fortitude check` save. The DC of this save increases as the attempts to Rotate the Wheel progress. Achieving a full 7 revolutions causes both double doors in this room to open (they close automatically in 24 hours).

* * *

**Critical Success** The wheel rotates 2 revolutions. The DC to Rotate the Wheel increases by 1.

**Success** The wheel rotates 1 revolution. The DC to Rotate the Wheel increases by 1.

**Failure** The character fails to complete a revolution. The DC to Rotate the Wheel increases by 2.

**Critical Failure** The character stumbles and loses their grip on the wheel, triggering the Test of Endurance hazard. The wheel unwinds, resetting its revolutions to 0 and its DC to 25.
