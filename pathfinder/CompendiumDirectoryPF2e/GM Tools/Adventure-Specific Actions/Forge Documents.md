# Forge Documents

### [[downtime]][[secret]]

**Category** interaction; 




**Overcome** `DC 34 Society check`

* * *

The PC prepares several forgeries that might serve as convincing props during the heist.

* * *

**Success** The PC creates convincing documents that grant the PCs 1 Edge Point they can use when presenting proper credentials, work orders, or invitations.

**Failure** The PC creates somewhat unconvincing documents. Inform the PCs the forgeries grant 1 Edge Point. However, when they use that Edge Point, it grants no benefit.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but a PC who uses the Edge Point on a failure gets a critical failure instead.
