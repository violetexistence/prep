# Costar `pf2:r`

### [[circus]]

**Category** interaction; 




**Trigger** Another performer in the same act as you is about to attempt a trick check.

**Requirements** The performer is willing to accept your aid.

* * *

You help another performer in the act pull off their trick, possibly granting them a bonus to the triggering trick check. Attempt the same check as the trick check you are attempting to aid. The DC to Costar is equal to the DC of the trick check. NPCs cannot Costar. This reaction otherwise acts as the [[Actions/Aid|Aid]] action.
