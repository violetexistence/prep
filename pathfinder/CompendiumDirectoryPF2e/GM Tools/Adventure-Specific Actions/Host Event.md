You dedicate a day to planning and hosting a special event, such as a feast, a small festival, or a public performance. Doing so requires an expenditure of 250 gp. Attempt a `DC 36 Diplomacy check`, `DC 36 Performance check`, `DC 36 Society check`, or appropriate Lore check. The result determines the impact of your efforts. You gain a cumulative +1 circumstance bonus to this check (maximum +4) for each additional 250 gp you spend on the event.
