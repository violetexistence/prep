# Navigate Steamgrotto

### [[concentrate]][[downtime]]

**Category** interaction; 




You spend time observing the patterns of geyser eruptions in Steamgrotto, then plan your moves through the region as best you can to avoid exposing yourself to danger. You can attempt to Navigate Steamgrotto using Nature, Perception, or Survival and rolling a successful DC 35 check, but using Perception doesn't provide you deeper insights into the nature of the danger and you suffer a -4 circumstance penalty as a result.

* * *

**Critical Success** You avoid the danger and anyone who Follows the Expert gains double the normal bonus to their roll granted from that activity.

**Success** You avoid the danger.

**Failure** You step a bit too close to a few geysers and mistime your movements. You take 10d6 fire damage (`DC 36 Reflex check`).

**Critical Failure** You badly misjudge your movements and are hit full-force by a geyser. You take 20d6 fire damage (`DC 36 Reflex check`).
