# Passion `pf2:2`
## Feat 1
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[fire]][[occult]]

**Category** deityboon; 




Even in death, the flames of excitement burn hot. Be it the result of ignited enthusiasm or burning anger inspired by love for another or something more, the chill of the grave can't quench the hero's emotions. You kindle your passion into actual flames for 1 minute. During this time, your body is engulfed in fire of a color of your choice that sheds bright light in a 40-foot radius (and dim light to the next 40 feet). Your melee Strikes inflict an additional 1d6 points of fire damage, you gain resistance 10 to fire, and you gain the following reaction.
