# Shed Time `pf2:0`

### 

**Category** interaction; 




**Trigger** You fail or critically fail a saving throw, are hit by a Strike, or would increase your dying condition's value.

**Requirements** You are located in the House at the Edge of Time (including any of Nyrissa's fables) and are currently under the protection of the Helix Theorem. You shed the timeline you currently occupy, then return to it once the triggering event passes. The exact effects depend on the nature of the triggering effect, as detailed below. You are no longer protected by the Helix Theorem; once this protection is lost, it cannot be regained.

* * *

*   **Failed Saving Throw.** Shift the degree of success up from Failure to Success, or a Critical Failure up to a Failure, for the triggering saving throw.
*   **Hit by a Strike.** If the triggering Strike was a Critical Success, change it to a Success. If the triggering Strike was a Success, change it to a Failure.
*   **Increase to Dying Condition**. Instead of increasing your dying condition, you lose the dying condition.
