# Azata's Grace `pf2:2`

### [[divine]]

**Category** offensive; 




**Aspect** celestial

**Activate** `pf2:2` command, Interact

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** _Monarch_ opens a conduit to Desna's palace of Cynosure and infuses your soul with the grace of the azatas who dance and frolic therein. You gain 50 additional Hit Points, increasing both your maximum and current Hit Points, as well as weakness 10 to lawful damage. You also gain the effects of the [[Adventure-Specific Actions/Righteous Call|Righteous Call]] gift, without expending that gift's daily use.

You can Dismiss the effect. If you do so, you unleash a wave of chaotic power in the form of a rainbow-like pulse of light, causing the relic to cast [[Spells/Confusing Colors|Confusing Colors]]. The effects of this casting of _scintillating pattern_ don't affect your allies.
