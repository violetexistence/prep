# Topple Crates `pf2:2`

### [[manipulate]]

**Category** interaction; 




**Requirements** You are adjacent to a column of crates.

* * *

You attempt to topple a stack of heavy crates onto a foe. Attempt a `DC 22 Athletics check` check.

* * *

**Success** You topple the crates toward a target within a 15-foot line from the column. The falling crates deal 3d10+6 bludgeoning damage with a `DC 26 Reflex check` save. A creature that critically fails is also knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]. Any squares where crates crashed down become difficult terrain.

**Failure** You are unable to topple the crates.

**Critical Failure** The crates topple onto you instead, with the same effects as a success but affecting only you and your square.
