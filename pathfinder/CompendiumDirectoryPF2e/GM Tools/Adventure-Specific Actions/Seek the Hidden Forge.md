# Seek the Hidden Forge

### [[downtime]][[secret]]

**Category** interaction; 




**Requirements** At least one Hidden Forge clue.

* * *

By spending a day examining Hidden Forge clues, consulting with locals, studying maps of Kovlar, and otherwise investigating the mystery, a PC attempts to determine the location of the secret shrine to Droskar in the dwarven city. A character can attempt to interpret these clues with a Perception, Society, or Survival check-the DC remains 36 regardless of the check used to interpret the clues. This DC is reduced by 2 for each Hidden Forge clue possessed beyond the first. Thus, if the character has access to two Hidden Forge Clues, the DC is reduced to 34, up to a maximum reduction to DC 22 if a character has 8 Hidden Forge Clues.

* * *

**Critical Success** The PC pinpoints the entrance to the Hidden Forge.

**Success** The PC makes significant progress toward determining the Hidden Forge's location, and gains a +4 circumstance bonus on their next check to Seek the Hidden Forge.

**Failure** The PC fails to determine anything informative from the clues.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the Droskar cultists catch wind of the investigation and are able to prepare their defenses.
