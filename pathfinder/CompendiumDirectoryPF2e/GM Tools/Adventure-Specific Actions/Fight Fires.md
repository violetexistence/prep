# Fight Fires `pf2:1`

### [[manipulate]]

**Category** interaction; 




You attempt to put out flames by kicking apart burning debris, smothering smaller fires, or moving unburnt items out of the path of flames. Attempt a `DC 15 Acrobatics check`, `DC 15 Athletics check`, or `DC 15 Survival check` check to determine the level of your success. If you use water as part of this action, you gain a +2 item bonus to this check. Alternately, you can use a spell to Fight Fires by attempting a spell attack roll as you Cast, although you'll need to describe how you're using the spell to the GM, who will then decide if the plan has a chance to succeed. If the spell has the Water trait, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to this check. Certain spells, at the GM's discretion, may automatically grant a critical success or instantly extinguish the flames.

**Critical Success** You gain 2 Extinguish Points.

**Success** You gain 1 Extinguish Point.

**Critical Failure** You lose 1 Extinguish Point.
