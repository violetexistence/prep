# Build Connections

### [[downtime]]

**Category** interaction; 




You dedicate a day to making friends in high places, typically by inviting yourself to parties, performing small favors to be repaid later, and generally projecting an aura of confidence and capability. Attempt a `DC 36 Crafting check`, `DC 36 Diplomacy check`, `DC 36 Performance check`, or appropriate Lore check. The result determines the impact of your efforts. If you have the [[Feats/Leverage Connections|Leverage Connections]] skill feat and roll a success, you get a critical success instead.

**Critical Success** For 1 month, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your skill checks to pursue the downtime activities listed here. You also earn a single favor that you can call in when you or an ally you're working with attempts a skill check for one of these downtime actions. That creature can roll twice and use the better result, after which the favor is considered repaid; calling in the favor is a fortune effect.

**Success** For 1 week, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your skill checks for the downtime activities listed here.

**Critical Failure** A faux pas embarrasses you, and rumors recount the incident widely. For 3 days, you take a -1 circumstance penalty to skill checks for the downtime activities listed here.
