# Deduce Traditions `pf2:1`

### [[concentrate]][[linguistic]][[secret]]

**Category** interaction; 




By interpreting a regent's personality, drawing upon what you know about dwarven tradition, and making educated guesses, you surmise what sorts of skills are most valued by the dwarven regent's guild-and thus infer what types of skills would most likely curry that regent's favor. Deduce Traditions requires a successful `DC 30 Perception check` or a successful `DC 25 Society check` check to yield accurate results.

* * *

**Critical Success** You learn one of the guild's favored skills and learn what that regent's Skepticism value is.

**Success** You learn one of the guild's favored skills.

**Failure** You learn none of the guild's favored skills.

**Critical Failure** You learn an incorrect favored skill.
