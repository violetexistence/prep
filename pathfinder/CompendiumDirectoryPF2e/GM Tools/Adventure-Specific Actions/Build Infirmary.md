# Build Infirmary

### [[downtime]][[manipulate]]

**Category** interaction; 




**Requirements** Crafting (master), Medicine (master), or hired medic; organized specialists

Choose a single room in Citadel Altaerein to serve as a dedicated infirmary. Once complete, the infirmary fulfills the healer's tools requirement for Medicine skill actions and grants a +2 circumstance bonus to Medicine checks made on site. This upgrade requires 20 days of work and a `DC 25 Crafting check` or `DC 25 Medicine check` check.
