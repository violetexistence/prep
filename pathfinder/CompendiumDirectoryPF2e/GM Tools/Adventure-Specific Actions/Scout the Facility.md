# Scout the Facility

### [[downtime]]

**Category** interaction; 




**Overcome** `DC 36 Perception check`, `DC 38 Society check`, `DC 34 Stealth check`

* * *

The PC spends part of the day observing the Bhetshamtal Estate, recording patrols, noting escape routes, and creating a mental map.

* * *

**Success** The PC makes decisive observations that grant the PCs 1 Edge Point that can be used for sneaking through or navigating the estate.

**Failure** The PC learns nothing noteworthy.

**Critical Failure** The PC misjudges some element of the security. Inform the PCs that the scouting grants 1 Edge Point. When they use that Edge Point, they don't get the normal benefit, and if they rolled a normal failure they get a critical failure instead.
