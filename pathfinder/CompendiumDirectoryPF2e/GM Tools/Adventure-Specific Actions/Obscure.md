# Obscure

### [[illusion]][[shadow]]

**Category** offensive; 




**Aspect** shadow

* * *

Your relic absorbs light and wraps shadow around you, hiding you in darkness. As long as you are in dim light in an area of shadows, you can attempt a Stealth check to [[Actions/Hide|Hide]], even if you aren't [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] against the creature, such as with a creature with darkvision.
