# Cunning Disguise

### [[exploration]]

**Category** interaction; 




**Overcome** `DC 35 Deception check` or DC 33 (see below)

* * *

The PCs conceal their true identities, relying on false personas to be admitted onto the estate. A PC can use a skill closely connected to their chosen disguise in place of Deception, such as Intimidation for a guard, Guild Lore for a merchant, or any food-related Lore for a caterer.

If a PC succeeds at a Cunning Disguise, roll a secret `DC 34 Perception check` for them to notice something off about one of the guests. On a success, inform them about the Dispel a Disguise Opportunity.
