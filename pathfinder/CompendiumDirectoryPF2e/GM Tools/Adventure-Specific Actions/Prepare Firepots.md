# Prepare Firepots

### [[downtime]][[manipulate]]

**Category** defensive; 




With the knowledge that there are some trolls in the army, preparation of firepots containing alchemical fire, oil, or some form of quickly combustible material may be invaluable to the battle. Preparing Firepots requires a Crafting (trained) check.

**Critical Success** Enough firepots are created that they are quickly available at all points in the battlefield, and as a result, the troll army that attacks Tatzlford loses its regeneration tactic.

**Success** Not enough firepots are created to ensure quick deployment. At the end of the troll army's turn, it must attempt a DC 20 Mobility check. If it fails, it loses its regeneration tactic until the end of its next turn.

**Critical Failure** The attempt to prepare firepots results in a spectacular explosion that inflicts 10d6 fire damage to the PC (`DC 25 Reflex check`).
