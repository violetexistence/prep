# Guild Investigation

### [[concentrate]][[exploration]][[secret]]

**Category** interaction; 




A PC spends a day and attempts a DC 30 Skill check to pursue their investigation into the guild.

* * *

**Critical Success** The PCs' investigation results in compelling evidence that Brigven is the culprit behind the shoddy weapons, and reveals the location of his shop to the PCs. This evidence forces Brigven to give up as soon as the PCs confront him in his shop without forcing them to talk him into a confession.

**Success** The investigation implies that Brigven is behind the shoddy weapons, and reveals the location of his shop to the PCs.

**Failure** The investigation yields no results, but does not alert Brigven of the threat.

**Critical Failure** The investigation yields no results, and Brigven learns that the PCs are on to him. He abandons his shop and flees to the Hidden Forge to seek shelter with the other Droskar cultists. In this case, the PCs can encounter Brigven in area D2-you can represent him with the statistics for Thea in that encounter.
