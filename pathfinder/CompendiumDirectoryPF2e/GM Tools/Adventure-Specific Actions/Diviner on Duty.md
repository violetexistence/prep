# Diviner on Duty

### [[exploration]]

**Category** interaction; 




**Trigger** A PC uses magic to aid in overcoming an Obstacle during infiltration.

**Overcome** 3 successes: `DC 35 Arcana check`, `DC 37 Deception check`, `DC 35 Nature check`, `DC 35 Occultism check`, `DC 35 Religion check`

Among the Scarlet Triad's security is a highly competent diviner! With spells such as [[Spells/Discern Lies|Discern Lies]], [[Spells/Mind Reading|Mind Reading]], [[Spells/See the Unseen|See the Unseen]], and [[Spells/Truesight|Truesight]], this diviner can see through most magical schemes the PCs might use.

The diviner is watching for magical threats, not poison. With a successful `DC 33 Deception check`, `DC 33 Thievery check`, or food-related Lore check, a PC can trick her into consuming something laden with an ingested poison. Her Fortitude save bonus is +23, and she withdraws if successfully poisoned. If not successfully poisoned, increase the PCs' Awareness Points by 2.
