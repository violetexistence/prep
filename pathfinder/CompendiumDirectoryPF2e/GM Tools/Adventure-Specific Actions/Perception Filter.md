# Perception Filter `pf2:2`

### [[mental]]

**Category** offensive; 




**Aspect** mind

**Activate** `pf2:2` envision

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** Your relic reaches into the minds of nearby creatures and blocks your presence from their perceptions. For the next 10 minutes, a creature that enters a 120-foot emanation, centered on you, must attempt a secret `Will check` save, after which the creature is then temporarily immune for 1 day.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature takes a â€“2 status penalty to Perception checks to [[Actions/Seek|Seek]] or otherwise detect you.

**Failure** You filter all of the creature's senses, making it difficult for it to notice you. When you are [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] or undetected from the creature, it doesn't observe you as soon as you do anything other than [[Actions/Hide|Hide]], [[Actions/Sneak|Sneak]], or Step. If it rolls a Perception check to Seek or otherwise detect you, it gets the outcome one degree of success worse than what it rolled, and if you roll a Stealth check to Hide, Sneak, or otherwise escape its attention, you get the outcome one degree of success better than what you rolled against the creature. If you use a hostile action toward the creature, the effect ends for that creature after your hostile action is completed.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the effect doesn't end for that creature if you use a hostile action against it.
