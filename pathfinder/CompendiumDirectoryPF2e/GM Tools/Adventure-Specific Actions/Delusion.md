# Delusion
## Feat 1
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[auditory]][[illusion]][[occult]][[olfactory]][[visual]]

**Category** deityboon; 




You weave illusions to fool mortal senses. However, the metaphysical distance between the spirit world and that of the living distorts how these figments appear to living viewers. To undead, and to creatures with illusion-piercing abilities such as true seeing, the images appear as you intend for them to. To other observers, these illusions always take on a macabre tone. Blood, bone, and shadow replace more mundane materials in the composition. Speech is warped to resemble either shrill screams or low-pitched growls and is generally unintelligible. You gain a +2 status bonus to Deception checks.

Once per day, you can cast one of the following spells as a 5th-rank innate occult spell: [[Spells/Mirage|Mirage]], [[Spells/Illusory Creature|Illusory Creature]], or [[Spells/Illusory Object|Illusory Object]].
