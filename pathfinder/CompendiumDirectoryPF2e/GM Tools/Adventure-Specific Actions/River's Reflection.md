# River's Reflection `pf2:1`
## Feat 1
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[manipulate]][[spellshape]]

**Category** deityboon; 




Existing between life and death can offer insights when it comes to channeling the energies of life and death. If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell with the positive or negative traits, that spell's effects on living and undead targets are reversed. All negative damage becomes positive damage and vice versa. Any ability to heal living creatures or undead creatures is similarly swapped.
