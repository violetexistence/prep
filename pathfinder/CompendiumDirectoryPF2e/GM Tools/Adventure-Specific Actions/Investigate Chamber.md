# Investigate Chamber

### [[exploration]][[manipulate]][[move]]

**Category** interaction; 




You take 10 minutes to investigate a specific room in the Golden Citadel to learn any information about it. Guards won't normally be annoyed by this if you investigate a public area, but if they see you investigating a private area they will attempt to escort you out before you can complete the investigation. Attempt a `DC 36 Perception check` to determine your level of success.

* * *

**Critical Success** You learn the room's read-aloud text, basic information, and any secret information.

**Success** You learn the room's read-aloud text and basic information.

**Failure** You fail to learn anything about the room other than its read-aloud text.

**Critical Failure** As failure above, but any guards who can observe you notice suspicious activity and attempt to escort you out of the area, either to the council chamber or out of the building entirely.
