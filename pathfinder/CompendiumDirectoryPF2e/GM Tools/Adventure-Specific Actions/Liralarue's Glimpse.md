# Liralarue's Glimpse `pf2:r`

### [[arcane]][[fortune]]

**Category** offensive; 




**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** You fail or critically fail a saving throw or attack roll.

**Requirements** You aren't stupefied.

* * *

You suddenly realize that what you thought was a catastrophic failure on your part was actually a supernaturally realistic vision from your immediate future. Reroll the saving throw or attack roll that triggered this reaction. If you fail the reroll, you instead succeed. If you critically fail the reroll, you instead merely fail the roll.

Although you can use Liralarue's Glimpse once per day, if you use this reaction more than once a week, your abuse of these glimpses of the future causes you to also glimpse dreadful, unavoidable pains and dooms that you'll certainly experience in the future. These glimpses provide no additional aid or benefit, but their distracting nature causes you to become [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] and prevents you from using Liralarue's Glimpse again for 7 days.
