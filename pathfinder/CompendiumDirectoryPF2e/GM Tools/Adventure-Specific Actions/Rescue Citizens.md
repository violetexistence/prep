# Rescue Citizens

### [[exploration]][[move]]

**Category** interaction; 




You focus your efforts on helping citizens escape or recover from wounds. Attempt a `DC 36 Diplomacy check` or `DC 36 Intimidation check` check to direct citizens to safety, a `DC 38 Medicine check` check to treat injured survivors, or a `DC 40 Society check` check to know about unusual escape routes to safety from the building and the surrounding alleys.

**Critical Success** Your efforts are resoundingly successful. Roll 2d6-this is the number of citizens trapped in the building who you lead to safety or the number of citizens who succumbed during this or the previous phase who you've managed to nurse back to life from the brink of death, split any way you wish.

**Success** You rescue 1d6 citizens from the flames.

**Failure** You fail to rescue any citizens from the fire and take 2d6 fire damage.

**Critical Failure** You take 4d6 fire damage as a blast of fire and falling debris strikes you. For every 5 fire damage you take from this, one citizen still trapped in the building perishes
