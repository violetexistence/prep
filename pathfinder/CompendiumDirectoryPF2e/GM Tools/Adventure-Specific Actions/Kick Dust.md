# Kick Dust `pf2:1`

### [[manipulate]]

**Category** offensive; 




**Requirements** You're standing in an area with ample loose soil.

* * *

By scooping and kicking with your foot, you launch a cloud of dust into an adjacent space. Attempt a `DC 15 Acrobatics check` or `DC 15 Athletics check` check. The size of the cloud depends on your check result.

* * *

**Critical Success** The cloud fills a 15-foot cone. Creatures in the cone are covered in dust for 2 rounds, and dust-covered creatures are [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] rather than [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]]. As an action, a creature can attempt a `DC 15 Reflex check` save to shake off the dust.

**Success** As critical success, but the cloud fills a 10-foot cone.

**Failure** You kick an insignificant amount of dust.

**Critical Failure** You misjudge your kick, causing you to stumble and become [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the beginning of your next turn.
