**Frequency** once per day

There are few bonds like those between fighters who have shared blows in an arena, and in so doing, come to understand each other. You focus on your emotional connection to one of the other tournament teams, and their power roars along it to you like a string set alight. You use the following ability, which you must have gained access to from the original team.

Borrowing the magic of the Magaambya, you use a legendary spell from Old-Mage Jatembe himself. You cast [[Spells/All is One, One is All|All is One, One is All]] as a 9th-rank arcane or primal innate spell.
