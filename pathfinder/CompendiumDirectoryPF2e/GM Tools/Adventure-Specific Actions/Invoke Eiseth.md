# Invoke Eiseth `pf2:1`

### [[auditory]][[concentrate]][[emotion]][[linguistic]][[mental]]

**Category** offensive; 




**Frequency** once per round

* * *

**Effect** You attempt to demoralize Lorthact by invoking his nemesis. Attempt a `DC 33 Deception check`, `DC 33 Intimidation check`, `DC 33 Performance check`, or `DC 33 Religion check` check. Regardless of your result, Lorthact is temporarily immune to your further attempts to Invoke Eiseth for 10 minutes, though not the attempts of others.

* * *

**Critical Success** Lorthact becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] and [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]].

**Success** Lorthact becomes frightened 2.

**Failure** Lorthact becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]].

**Critical Failure** Your floundering attempt backfires and instead amuses Lorthact; he is temporarily immune to all attempts to Invoke Eiseth until the end of your next turn.
