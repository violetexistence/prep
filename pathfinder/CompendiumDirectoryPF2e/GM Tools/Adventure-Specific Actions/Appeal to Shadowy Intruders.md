### [[auditory]][[concentrate]][[linguistic]][[mental]]

**Category** interaction; 




**Requirements** A fetchling sneak you can see is visibly shaken, such as by being reduced to half of their maximum Hit Points or fewer.

* * *

You call out to a visibly shaken foe and attempt to convince them to surrender. Depending upon your strategy, attempt a `Deception check`, `Diplomacy check`, or `Intimidation check` check against the foe's Will DC to make your case for the foe's surrender.

* * *

**Critical Success** The foe is quick to surrender and attempts to convince their allies to surrender as well. You and your allies gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to Appeal to Shadowy Intruders for 1 minute.

**Success** The foe takes your words to heart and surrenders to you immediately.

**Failure** The foe brushes off your attempt and continues to fight.

**Critical Failure** Your argument is severely flawed or laughable. The foe disregards your words and continues to fight. You take a -1 circumstance penalty to checks to Appeal to Shadowy Intruders for 1 minute.
