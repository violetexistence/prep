### [[exploration]]

**Category** interaction; 




You help the elven hunters look for signs of animals. Attempt a `DC 17 Nature check` check or `DC 17 Perception check`.

**Critical Success** You make an impressive and potentially dangerous find, such as a large pack of particularly healthy (and thus cranky) red river boars or a large waterbuck with razor-sharp horns. You also find signs of animals that are safer to hunt than your impressive and delicious find.

**Success** You discover signs of animals that are safe to hunt.

**Failure** Your efforts have scared away the best game, and the hunting party must set their sights on river turtles and bats.

**Critical Failure** Your efforts have scared away too many animals, leaving the hunting party with a sparse amount of game to catch. The party loses 2 IP.
