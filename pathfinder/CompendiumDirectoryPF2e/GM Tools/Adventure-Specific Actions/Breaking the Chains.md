**Requirements** The PCs have overcome the other three Obstacles for this phase.

**Overcome** 2 successes; `DC 37 Athletics check`, `DC 33 Thievery check`

The captives are sealed behind bars and chained to the walls. The PCs undo these bindings as quietly as possible. Once the PCs defeat this Obstacle, they have freed Exavisu and one of her assistants and can begin Phase 4: Extraction. See the That's Not Everyone Complication.
