# Chilling Paralysis `pf2:2`
## Feat 1
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[cold]][[incapacitation]][[occult]]

**Category** deityboon; 




**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

The unnatural cold of your touch freezes muscles and locks joints, leaving your victims shivering and unable to move. Attempt a melee weapon or unarmed Strike against a target. If you hit, in addition to all the Strike's normal effects, the target must attempt a `Fortitude check` save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The supernatural cold causes the target to shiver and quake, making them [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] until the end of their next turn.

**Failure** The supernatural cold paralyzes the target for 1 round, then leaves them slowed 1 for 1 round after.

**Critical Failure** The target becomes frozen in place by the cold, and is [[Conditions/Paralyzed|Paralyzed]] for 1 minute. It can attempt a new save at the end of each of its turns, and the DC cumulatively decreases by 1 on each attempt. Once the target recovers, they're slowed 1 for 1 round.
