# Prove Peace `pf2:2`

### [[concentrate]][[manipulate]]

**Category** interaction; 




**Requirements** You know the conflict that created a specific siege shard, and the siege shard is [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]].

* * *

You touch the siege shard, establish a mental connection, and relay facts of the conflict's resolution.

Attempt a check to [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] about the conflict that created the shard, using the siege shard's Will DC. If you succeed, you prove the conflict's end, and the siege shard reverts to ordinary stone. On a critical failure, images of the past conflict overwhelm you, and you are [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]] until the end of your next turn.
