### 

**Category** offensive; 




**Frequency** only once per season

**Trigger** You're about to roll initiative

* * *

**Effect** Something about the situation triggers your defenses, allowing you to react to sudden peril more quickly. You gain a status bonus to your initiative roll equal to the number of seasons since you've started Season of Ghosts (+1 during the first adventure, up to a maximum of +4 during the fourth and final adventure). If you can communicate a warning to other PCs, they gain this bonus to their initiative as well.
