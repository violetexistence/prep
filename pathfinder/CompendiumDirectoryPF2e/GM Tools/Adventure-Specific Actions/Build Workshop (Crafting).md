# Build Workshop (Crafting)

### [[downtime]][[manipulate]]

**Category** interaction; 




**Requirements** Crafting (master), Specialty Crafting (any), or any hired specialist; organized specialists

* * *

Pick a room in Citadel Altaerein to serve as a crafting area for a specific Crafting skill chosen from one of the crafting specialties listed under the [[Feats/Specialty Crafting|Specialty Crafting]] feat. You can have multiple workshops, each devoted to its own skill. Use of a workshop grants a +1 circumstance bonus to Crafting checks, or a +3 circumstance bonus to Crafting skill checks associated with that workshop's specialty. This upgrade takes 20 days of work to complete and a `DC 25 Crafting check` check.
