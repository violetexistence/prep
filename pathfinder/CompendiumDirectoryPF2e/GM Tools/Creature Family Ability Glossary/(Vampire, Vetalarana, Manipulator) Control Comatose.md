# (Vampire, Vetalarana, Manipulator) Control Comatose

### 

**Category** offensive; 




**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** The vetalarana manipulator spends 10 minutes to take psychic control of the creatures they've rendered comatose with Drain Thoughts. This has the effects of the [[Spells/Possession|Possession]] spell, but lasts for up to 6 hours, has a range of 1 mile, and the vetalarana can control a number of comatose victims at a time equal to half the vetalarana's level. A comatose victim can't resist this possession and automatically gets a critical failure on its saving throw against Control Comatose.

As long as a comatose victim is controlled by a vetalarana manipulator in this way, the victim's stupefied and [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]] conditions are temporarily suppressed.
