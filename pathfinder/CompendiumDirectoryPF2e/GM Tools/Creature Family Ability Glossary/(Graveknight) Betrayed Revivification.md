# (Graveknight) Betrayed Revivification

### 

**Category** offensive; 




The graveknight died after being deeply betrayed.

Instead of being immune to a type of energy damage, it is immune to mental damage, its weapons deal 1d6 mental damage, and its Devastating Blast deals mental damage with a Will saving throw instead of Reflex.
