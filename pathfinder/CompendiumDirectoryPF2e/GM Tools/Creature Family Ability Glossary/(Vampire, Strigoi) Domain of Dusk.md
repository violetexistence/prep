# (Vampire, Strigoi) Domain of Dusk `pf2:2`

### [[divine]][[shadow]]

**Category** defensive; 




With a wave of its hand, the strigoi calls fourth vile ruination from the surrounding shadows, causing coils of darkness and shadowy bats, rats, and wolves to lash out at living targets in a 30-foot emanation. Living creatures in this area take 1d6 void damage +1d6 per 2 levels possessed by the strigoi (`Fortitude check` save against the DC of the strigoi's level). A creature that fails this save is also [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] for 1 round (or [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] for 1 round and then dazzled for 1 round)
