# (Siabrae) Blight Mastery

### 

**Category** offensive; 




Any of the siabrae's spells or effects that would normally be restricted to affecting animals can also affect undead animals. Furthermore, any animals the siabrae takes the form of or summons appear to be diseased, malnourished, or even dead and rotting. (This doesn't affect their statistics.)
