# (Cryptid, Mutant) Explosive End

### 

**Category** offensive; 




The mutant cryptid's death reveals one last surprise as it explodes into flame, acid, a pile of toxic goop, or something stranger still. Choose a damage type appropriate for the mutant cryptid. When it dies, it explodes, dealing 1d6 damage of the chosen type to each creature in a 10-foot emanation, with a `Reflex check` save against a standard DC of the creature's level. The damage increases by 1d6 at 3rd level and every odd level thereafter.
