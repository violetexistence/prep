# (Siabrae) Stone Antlers

### 

**Category** offensive; 




The siabrae grows a pair of stony antlers or horns from its head, which give it an antler attack that deals 1d6+2 bludgeoning damage for every 3 levels and inflicts stony shards. If the siabrae wishes, they can keep these antlers while polymorphed, using the normal statistics of the stone antler attack.
