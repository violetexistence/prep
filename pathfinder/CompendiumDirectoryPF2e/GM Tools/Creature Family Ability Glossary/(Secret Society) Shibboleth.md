# (Secret Society) Shibboleth

### 

**Category** interaction; 




Secret society members can communicate with other members of their secret society using coded language that seems innocuous enough to go unnoticed by most onlookers. A creature specifically gauging the conversation, such as with [[Actions/Sense Motive|Sense Motive]], can attempt a secret Perception check against the secret society member's Deception DC to notice something secret has been communicated, after which they can attempt a Society check against the same DC. On a success, they discover the rough topic of the message; on a critical success, they discover the exact message.
