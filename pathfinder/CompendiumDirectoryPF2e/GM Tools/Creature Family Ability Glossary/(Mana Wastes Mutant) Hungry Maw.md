# (Mana Wastes Mutant) Hungry Maw

### 

**Category** offensive; 




A mouth full of razor-sharp teeth opens somewhere on the mutant's body. They gain a maw Strike (an unarmed attack that does piercing damage roughly the same as the damage dealt by their most damaging melee attack), and they gain the Vengeful Bite reaction.
