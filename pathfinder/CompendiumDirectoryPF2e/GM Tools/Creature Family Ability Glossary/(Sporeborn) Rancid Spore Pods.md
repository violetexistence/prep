# (Sporeborn) Rancid Spore Pods

### [[disease]][[fungus]]

**Category** defensive; 




The sporeborn is covered in spore pods that rupture when it takes any piercing damage or a critical hit. In either case, adjacent creatures are hit with spores, causing them to become [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] unless they succeed at a `Fortitude check` save.
