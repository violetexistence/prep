# (Cryptid, Rumored) Obscura Vulnerability

### 

**Category** offensive; 




The cryptid is weakened by those who seek its truth. Whenever a creature succeeds at a Recall Knowledge check to identify the rumored cryptid, the rumored cryptid becomes [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]] (or [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 2]] if the Recall Knowledge check was a critical success).
