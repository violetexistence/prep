# (Vampire, Vrykolakas Master) Dominate Animal `pf2:1`

### [[divine]][[incapacitation]][[mental]]

**Category** offensive; 




The vrykolakas can cast [[Spells/Dominate|Dominate]] at will as a divine innate spell that affects only animals. The save DC is a high DC for the vrykolakas's level, and a creature that succeeds is immune to that vrykolakas's Dominate Animal for 24 hours. Destroying the vrykolakas ends the effect, but reducing it to 0 HP does not.

A dominated animal takes a -4 circumstance penalty to saving throws against the vrykolakas's Feral Possession.
