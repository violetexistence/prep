# (Secret Society) Prepared Diversion `pf2:0`

### 






**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

**Effect** The secret society member has fellow members in all sorts of places, ready to make a distraction to help them duck from sight or make a quick attack against their foe. The secret society member either Creates a Diversion or Feints. If they [[Actions/Create a Diversion|Create a Diversion]], it doesn't gain either the auditory, linguistic, or manipulate trait (since someone else has provided the diversion), and onlookers who have already been diverted by the secret society member don't receive a +4 circumstance bonus against the attempt. If they [[Actions/Feint|Feint]], they don't need to be in melee reach of their target, and the benefit applies to both melee and ranged attacks against their target.
