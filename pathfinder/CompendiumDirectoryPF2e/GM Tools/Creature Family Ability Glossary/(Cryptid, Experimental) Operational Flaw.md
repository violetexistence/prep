# (Cryptid, Experimental) Operational Flaw

### 

**Category** offensive; 




An experimental cryptid has a flaw in its construction that can be identified with a successful Perception check to [[Actions/Seek|Seek]] against the hard DC of the creature's level. An experimental cryptid has weakness equal to its level to the attacks of any creature that has successfully located the experiment's operational flaw.
