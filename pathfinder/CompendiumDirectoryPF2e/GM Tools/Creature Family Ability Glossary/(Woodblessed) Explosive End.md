# (Woodblessed) Explosive End

### [[primal]][[wood]]

**Category** offensive; 




When the woodblessed dies, the planar portal inside of them collapses, causing them to explode in a 20-foot burst of vines that deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage per level to all creatures with a `Reflex check` save against the woodblessed's spell DC. The woodblessed's body is completely consumed, though their root network and gear remain behind.
