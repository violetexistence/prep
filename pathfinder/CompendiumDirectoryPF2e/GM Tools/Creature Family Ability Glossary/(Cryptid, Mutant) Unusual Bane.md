# (Cryptid, Mutant) Unusual Bane

### 

**Category** offensive; 




The mutant cryptid gains an unusual weakness to a specific bane-such as aversion to saffron or to the sound of children's laughter. The first time each round the creature comes within 15 feet of its bane or interacts with its bane (such as stepping over a line of saffron or hearing children laugh) it takes an amount of mental damage equal to its level and must attempt a `Will check` save with a hard DC for its level. On a failure, it's [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]] ([[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 3]] on a critical failure).
