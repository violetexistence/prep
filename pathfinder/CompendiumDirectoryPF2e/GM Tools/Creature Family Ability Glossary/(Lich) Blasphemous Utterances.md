# (Lich) Blasphemous Utterances

### [[arcane]][[aura]][[mental]]

**Category** defensive; 




10 feet. The lich is accompanied by a constant echo of blasphemous murmurs and tainted whispers.

A creature in the aura takes a -2 circumstance penalty to saves against mental effects and can't take actions that have the concentrate trait unless they succeed at a `DC 10 Flat check` check. On a failure, the action is disrupted.
