# (Vampire, Jiang-Shi, Basic) Rigor Mortis

### 

**Category** offensive; 




The jiang-shi ignores difficult terrain and effects that would render them [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]. A jiang-shi can't take the [[Actions/Drop Prone|Drop Prone]] action. When they [[Actions/Leap|Leap]] they don't trigger reactions that are normally triggered by move actions, such as Attacks of Opportunity.
