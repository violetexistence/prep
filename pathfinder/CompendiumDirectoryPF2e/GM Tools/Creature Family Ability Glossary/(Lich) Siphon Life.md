# (Lich) Siphon Life

### 

**Category** offensive; 




A lich's form draws forth life from those who come into contact with it. When the lich damages a living creature with an unarmed attack, the lich gains 5 temporary Hit Points and the creature must succeed at a `Fortitude check` save against the lich's spell DC â€“ 2 or become [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]].

If the lich is [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]] at the start of its turn, each creature grabbing or restraining it must succeed at a Fortitude save or become drained 1. If the lich siphons a creature's life again, the drained value increase by 1, to a maximum of [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 4]].
