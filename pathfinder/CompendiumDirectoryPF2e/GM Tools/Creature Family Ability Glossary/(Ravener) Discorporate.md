# (Ravener) Discorporate `pf2:0`

### [[divine]]

**Category** defensive; 




**Trigger** The ravener takes excess damage to their soul ward but still has at least 51 Hit Points in their soul ward

* * *

**Effect** The ravener draws deeply into their soul ward, discorporating their body into soul energy in order to escape. They take 50 damage to their soul ward and their physical body vanishes, reappearing 1d4 hours later in a random location within 1 mile from the location where they used Discorporate.
