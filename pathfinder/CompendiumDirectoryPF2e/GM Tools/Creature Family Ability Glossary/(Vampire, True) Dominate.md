# (Vampire, True) Dominate `pf2:2`

### [[divine]][[incapacitation]][[mental]][[visual]]

**Category** offensive; 




The vampire can cast [[Spells/Dominate|Dominate]] at will as a divine innate spell. Casting it requires staring into the target's eyes, giving the spell the visual trait (`Will check`). The save DC uses the high spell DC of the vampire's level, and a creature that succeeds is temporarily immune to that vampire's Dominate for 24 hours.

Fully destroying the vampire ends the domination, but merely reducing the vampire to 0 HP is insufficient to break the spell.
