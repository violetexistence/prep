# (Vampire, Strigoi Progenitor) Create Spawn

### [[divine]][[downtime]]

**Category** offensive; 




If a creature dies after being reduced to 0 HP by Drink Essence or Domain of Dusk, the vampire can turn this victim into a vampire by donating some of its own blood to the victim and burying the victim in earth for 3 nights.

If the new vampire is lower level than its creator, it is under the creator's control. If a vampire controls too many spawn at once (as determined by the GM), strong-willed spawn can free themselves by succeeding at a `Will check` saving throw against the vampire's Will DC.

A victim that is 8th level or higher becomes a strigoi servant, while a lower-level victim instead becomes a moroi vampire
