# (Secret Society) Not Today! `pf2:r`

### 

**Category** defensive; 




**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** The secret society member is reduced to 0 Hit Points

* * *

**Effect** Whether it's a fellow society member waiting in the wings to spirit them away, a clever contraption, a contingent spell, or some other means, a secret society member always has an escape plan. Instead of being reduced to 0 Hit Points, the secret society member remains at 1 Hit Point. They gain temporary Hit Points equal to their level and then Stride twice. If they have the appropriate forms of movement, they can instead choose to [[Actions/Burrow|Burrow]], [[Actions/Climb|Climb]], Fly, or Swim.
