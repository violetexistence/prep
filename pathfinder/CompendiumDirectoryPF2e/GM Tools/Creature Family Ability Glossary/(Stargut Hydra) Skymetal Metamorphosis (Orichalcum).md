# (Stargut Hydra) Skymetal Metamorphosis (Orichalcum)

### 

**Category** defensive; 




Each stargut hydra has at least one metamorphosis resulting from consuming a specific skymetal and internalizing its properties.

**Orichalcum** When the stargut hydra has only two heads remaining, it is [[Conditions/Quickened|Quickened]]. It can use the extra action only to Stride or Strike.
