# (Vampire, Vetalarana, Manipulator) Paralyzing Claws

### [[incapacitation]][[occult]]

**Category** offensive; 




Any living creature hit by a vetalarana manipulator's claw Strike must succeed at a `Fortitude check` save or become [[Conditions/Paralyzed|Paralyzed]]. The target can attempt a new save at the end of each of its turns to end the effect, and the DC cumulatively decreases by 1 on each such save. Use the moderate DC for the creature's level.
