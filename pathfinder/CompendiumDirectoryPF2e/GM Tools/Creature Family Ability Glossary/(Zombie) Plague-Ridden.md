# (Zombie) Plague-Ridden

### [[disease]]

**Category** defensive; 




The zombie carries a plague that can create more of its own kind.

This functions as the [[Monster Core/Plague Zombie|Plague Zombie's]] zombie rot, except at stage 5, the victim rises as another of the zombie's type, rather than a plague zombie.

**Zombie Rot**

An infected creature can't heal damage it takes from zombie rot until it has been cured of the disease.

**Saving Throw** `Fortitude check`. Use the high spell DC for the zombie's level.

**Stage 1** carrier with no ill effect (1 day)

**Stage 2** 1d6 void damage (1 day)

**Stage 3** 1d6 void damage (1 day)

**Stage 4** 1d6 void damage (1 day)

**Stage 5** dead, rising as another of the zombie's type immediately
