# (Ghost) Inhabit Object `pf2:1`

### 

**Category** offensive; 




The ghost possesses an object of size Large or smaller within 20 feet, making it an animated object. This animated object's level can be no higher than the ghost's level -2. If the target object is being held by a creature, the bearer can attempt a `Will check` save to prevent the possession.

This possession ends when the object is destroyed or the ghost leaves it. At this point, the ghost reappears in the object's square and can't Inhabit an Object again for 1d4 rounds.

For DCs, use the high spell DC of the ghost's level.
