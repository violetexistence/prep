# (Skeleton) Skeleton of Roses

### 

**Category** defensive; 




Thick briars have grown through the skeleton's bones, covering it in red roses with inch-long thorns.

The skeleton's unarmed melee Strikes deal additional piercing damage equal to 1/3 the skeleton's level (minimum 1 damage).

At the end of each of its turns, if the skeleton has caused piercing damage with its thorns, it regains HP equal to its level (minimum 1). Each time the skeleton regains HP in this way, another rose blossoms.
