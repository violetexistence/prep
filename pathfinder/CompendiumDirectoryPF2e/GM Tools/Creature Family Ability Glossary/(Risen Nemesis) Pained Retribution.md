# (Risen Nemesis) Pained Retribution `pf2:2`

### [[mental]]

**Category** offensive; 




The Risen Nemesis demands the PCs see how they have wronged them. All PCs within 30 feet of the Risen Nemesis must attempt a `DC 42 Will check` save. Regardless of the outcome, the PCs become temporarily immune to this ability for 24 hours. On failure, the PCs are [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]] by invisible chains of guilt that only they can see ([[Actions/Escape|Escape]] DC 42). On a critical failure, the PC is also [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] for 1 minute as they hesitate from a guilty conscience.
