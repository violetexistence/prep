# (Ravener) Consume Soul `pf2:0`

### [[death]][[divine]]

**Category** offensive; 




**Trigger** A living creature within 30 feet of the ravener dies

* * *

**Effect** The ravener tears the creature's soul from its body with their maw and gulps it down. The dying creature must attempt a `Fortitude check` save with the same DC as the ravener's Breath Weapon.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The ravener tears off a small chunk of the creature's soul. If the victim is restored to life, they are [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]] in addition to any other side effects of returning to life. The ravener adds a number of Hit Points to their soul ward equal to half the creature's level.

**Failure** As success, but the creature's soul is ravaged. The creature is [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 3]] and the ravener adds a number of Hit Points to their soul ward equal to the creature's level.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the ravener devours the entire soul. The victim can't be restored to life as long as the ravener exists except via a 10th-rank effect such as [[Spells/Miracle|Miracle]] or [[Spells/Wish|Wish]], and the ravener adds a number of Hit Points to their soul ward equal to twice the creature's level.
