# (Cryptid, Mutant) Marrowlance

### 

**Category** offensive; 




The mutant cryptid can make wicked spears of bone erupt from its body. The creature can make marrowlance ranged unarmed attacks. Use the highest attack modifier from the creature's highest ranged Strike, as well as the damage from that Strike. If it has no ranged attacks, use moderate accuracy and low damage for the creature's level. Marrowlance unarmed attacks have a range of 60 feet and the versatile S trait.
