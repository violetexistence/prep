# (Visitant) Vengeful Presence

### [[aura]][[emotion]][[mental]]

**Category** defensive; 




20 feet. A creature that starts its turn within the visitant's aura must succeed at a `Will check` save or be overcome with a thirst for vengeance.

For 1d4 rounds (1 minute on a critical failure), if the affected creature was attacked within the last round (whether or not the attack hit), the creature must use at least 1 action per round to Strike or use a hostile action toward its last attacker as long as the attacker is still alive. Failure to do so deals the affected creature 1d6 mental damage, plus 1d6 for every 5 levels the visitant has.
