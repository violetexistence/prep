# (Floodslain) Vomit Flotsam `pf2:2`

### [[occult]]

**Category** offensive; 




A floodslain creature's body is filled with debris from their horrific death, which they can spew at their enemies. The floodslain vomits flotsam in a 15-foot cone. Any creature in the area takes 1d8 bludgeoning damage per level of the floodslain creature (minimum 1d8) with a `Reflex check` save against the floodslain's Fortitude DC.
