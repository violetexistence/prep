# (Cryptid, Primeval) Broken Arsenal

### 

**Category** offensive; 




Fragments of broken blades and spears, the remnants of countless failed attempts to fell the primeval cryptid, remain lodged in its flesh. When an adjacent creature hits the primeval cryptid with a melee attack or otherwise touches it, that creature takes piercing damage equal to half the primeval cryptid's level (minimum 1 damage).
