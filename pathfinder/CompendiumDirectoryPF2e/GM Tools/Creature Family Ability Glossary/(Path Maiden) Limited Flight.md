# (Path Maiden) Limited Flight

### 

**Category** interaction; 




A path maiden has a fly Speed equal to her Speed but can't fly higher than 10 feet above the ground, and if she ends her turn above a nonsolid surface, she vanishes and rematerializes on the last space she occupied over solid ground and becomes [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]].
