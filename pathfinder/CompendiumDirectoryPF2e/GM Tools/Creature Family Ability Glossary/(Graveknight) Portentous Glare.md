# (Graveknight) Portentous Glare

### [[aura]][[divine]][[emotion]][[fear]][[mental]][[visual]]

**Category** offensive; 




30 feet. The graveknight's visage is one of overwhelming menace. When a creature ends its turn in the aura, it must attempt a `Will check` saving throw. A creature that fails is [[Conditions/Doomed|Doomed 1]] (or doomed 1 and [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] on a critical failure). The graveknight can activate or deactivate the aura by using an Interact action to open or close their helmet visor.
