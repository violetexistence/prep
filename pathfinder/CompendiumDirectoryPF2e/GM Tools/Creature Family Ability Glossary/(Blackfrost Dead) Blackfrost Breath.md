# (Blackfrost Dead) Blackfrost Breath `pf2:2`

### [[occult]]

**Category** offensive; 




The blackfrost dead gasps sharply, then exhales a mist of dark-blue blackfrost particles in a 5-foot emanation. All creatures within the mist become [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]], and all creatures outside the mist become concealed to creatures within it. The mist persists for 1 minute. A creature that ends its turn in the mist is exposed to blackfrost. The blackfrost dead can't use Blackfrost Breath again for 1d4 rounds.
