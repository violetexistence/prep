# (Graveknight) Empty Save for Dust

### 

**Category** defensive; 




The graveknight's armor contains nothing more than swirling dust that puffs out from joints in their armor. A living creature that touches or is touched by the graveknight (including one hit by the graveknight's fist Strike) must succeed at a `Reflex check` saving throw or become contaminated with the dust. While contaminated, the targeted creature is [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] and gains weakness to the graveknight's energy damage equal to half the graveknight's level. The contamination ends after 1 minute or when the creature is doused with water, whichever occurs first.
