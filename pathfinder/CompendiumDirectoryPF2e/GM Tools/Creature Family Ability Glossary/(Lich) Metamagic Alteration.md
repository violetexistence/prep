# (Lich) Metamagic Alteration `pf2:1`

### [[concentrate]][[spellshape]]

**Category** offensive; 




If the lich's next action is to [[Actions/Cast a Spell|Cast a Spell]], they can alter it in one of two ways.

*   Increase the range of that spell by 30 feet (giving it a range of 30 feet if it's a touch spell).
*   Alternatively, the lich can change the area of the spell if the spell has an area and doesn't have a duration. If the spell is a burst with a radius of at least 10 feet, increase the radius by 5 feet. If it is a line or a cone that has an area of 15 feet or smaller, add 10 feet to the area.
