# (Martial Artist) Constant Feint Stance

### 

**Category** offensive; 




This stance option replaces a different Stance Shift option (usually Secure Grapple Stance). +2 to attempts to [[Actions/Feint|Feint]]. If the mixed martial artist rolls a critical failure to Feint, they get a failure instead. If they successfully Feint, they can use Stance Shift as a free action. Unlike other stances, in this stance the mixed martial artist can't make Strikes.
