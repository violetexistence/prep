# (Worm That Walks) Swarm Shape `pf2:1`

### [[concentrate]]

**Category** offensive; 




The worm that walks collapses into a shapeless swarm of worms. It drops all held, worn, and carried items.

While discorporated, the worm that walks can't use attack actions and can't cast spells, but it can move through areas small enough for its individual worms to fit without having to Squeeze. It can use the same action to coalesce back into its normal form.
