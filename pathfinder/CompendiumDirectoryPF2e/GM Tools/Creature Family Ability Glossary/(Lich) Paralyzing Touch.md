# (Lich) Paralyzing Touch

### [[arcane]][[curse]][[incapacitation]]

**Category** offensive; 




A creature damaged by the lich's hand Strike must succeed at a `Fortitude check` save against the lich's spell DC-4.

The creature becomes [[Conditions/Paralyzed|Paralyzed]] for 1 round on a failure. On a critical failure, the creature is paralyzed permanently, falls [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]], and seems dead. A `DC 25 Medicine check` check reveals the victim is alive.
