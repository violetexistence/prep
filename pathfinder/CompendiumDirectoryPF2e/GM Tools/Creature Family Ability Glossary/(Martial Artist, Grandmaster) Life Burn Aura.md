# (Martial Artist, Grandmaster) Life Burn Aura `pf2:3`

### [[aura]][[force]]

**Category** offensive; 




The grandmaster transmutes their lifespan into an expulsion of qi. For the next minute, the grandmaster is surrounded by a 30-foot emanation that deals 3d6 force damage to all creatures who start their turn within the emanation, including the grandmaster themself. While Life Burn Aura is active, the grandmaster's fist Strikes deal 2 additional die of weapon damage. When the aura disappears, the grandmaster is permanently [[Conditions/Doomed|Doomed 1]]. This condition is cumulative.
