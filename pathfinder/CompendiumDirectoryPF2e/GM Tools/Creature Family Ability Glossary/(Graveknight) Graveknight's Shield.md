# (Graveknight) Graveknight's Shield

### [[arcane]]

**Category** defensive; 




The graveknight's curse extends to their shield, or the graveknight's armor uses a portion of itself to produce a shield.

The graveknight has a shield that uses the statistics of a _[[Equipment/Sturdy Shield (Minor)|Sturdy Shield]]_ of a level no higher than the graveknight's level - 1.

The shield is quasi-independent of the graveknight and automatically protects the graveknight from harm. When the shield is raised, it automatically uses Shield Block to reduce the damage of the first attack against the graveknight each round without the graveknight needing to spend their reaction to do so.

The shield automatically rejuvenates with the rest of the graveknight and must be destroyed in the same manner as the graveknight's armor.
