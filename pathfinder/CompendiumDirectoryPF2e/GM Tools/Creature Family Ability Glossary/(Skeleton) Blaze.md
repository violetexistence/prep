# (Skeleton) Blaze

### 

**Category** offensive; 




The skeleton is wreathed with fire, which doesn't consume its bones or gear.

The skeleton gains immunity to fire and weakness 5 to cold, loses its resistance to cold, and its Strikes deal additional persistent fire damage equal to half the skeleton's level (minimum 1 damage).
