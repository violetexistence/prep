# (Skeleton) Frozen

### 

**Category** defensive; 




The skeleton's bones are covered in a thin layer of ice. The skeleton gains immunity to cold and weakness 5 to fire and loses resistance to fire. The skeleton is surrounded by an aura of cold that deals cold damage equal to half the skeleton's level to all adjacent creatures at the start of the skeleton's turn (`Reflex check` save with a standard DC for its level).
