# (Mana Wastes Mutant) Revolting Appearance

### [[arcane]][[aura]][[visual]]

**Category** offensive; 




60 feet. Details of the mutant's appearance are disturbing and unnatural in the extreme. A non-mutant living creature who begins their turn within 60 feet of the mutant must succeed at a Fortitude save or become [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]]. A creature who succeeds at its save is then temporarily immune to the aura for 24 hours.
