# (Zombie) Tearing Grapple

### 

**Category** offensive; 




The zombies work in groups to rip foes to pieces. Whenever a zombie with this ability successfully [[Actions/Grapple|Grapples]] a foe that's already [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]] by another zombie with this ability, they violently struggle over the poor victim, dealing fist damage (or a similar Strike's damage if the zombie doesn't have a fist Strike). If the grapple is a critical success, the target takes double damage and ceases being grabbed or restrained by any other creatures. If the zombie has the [[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Grab|Grab]] ability, using Grab deals half its fist Strike damage to the target.
