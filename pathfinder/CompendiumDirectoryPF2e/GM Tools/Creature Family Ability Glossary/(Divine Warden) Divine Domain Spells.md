# (Divine Warden) Divine Domain Spells

### 

**Category** offensive; 




The divine warden selects two of its patron deity's domains. The divine warden can cast the basic domain spell for its chosen domains. The divine warden has a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. It can't [[Actions/Refocus|Refocus]], but its focus pool automatically refills 24 hours after it last used a Focus Point. If the divine warden is at least 10th level, it also gains the advanced domain spells for its chosen domains, and its focus pool increases to 2 Focus Points.
