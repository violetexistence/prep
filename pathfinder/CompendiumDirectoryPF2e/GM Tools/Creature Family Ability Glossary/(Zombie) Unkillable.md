# (Zombie) Unkillable

### 

**Category** defensive; 




This zombie is nigh unkillable. The zombie loses its weakness to slashing and gains resistance against all damage equal to its level (minimum 3), and it gains weakness equal to twice its level (minimum 6) to critical hits.

Increase the zombie's level by 1 if you give it this ability.
