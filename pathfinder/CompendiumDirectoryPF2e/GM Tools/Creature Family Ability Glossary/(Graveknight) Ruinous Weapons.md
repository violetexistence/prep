# (Graveknight) Ruinous Weapons

### 

**Category** offensive; 




When created, a graveknight chooses one of the following energy types that was relevant to their life or death: acid, cold, electricity, or fire.

Any weapon the graveknight wields or unarmed attack the graveknight uses gains the effects of the _caustic_, _frost_, _shock_, or _flaming_ weapon rune, respectively, in addition to a +1 striking weapon rune.

If the graveknight is 14th level or higher, their weapons instead gain the effects of the greater versions of both of these runes.
