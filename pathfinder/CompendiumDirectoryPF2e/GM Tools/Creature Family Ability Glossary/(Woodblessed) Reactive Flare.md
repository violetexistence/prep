# (Woodblessed) Reactive Flare `pf2:r`

### 

**Category** offensive; 




**Trigger** The woodblessed is damaged by a creature within their reach

* * *

**Effect** Distracted by the pain, the woodblessed's concentration slips and splinters erupt from their body as they temporarily lose control of the planar energy within them. Both the triggering creature and the woodblessed take 1d6 piercing damage + 1d6 per 2 levels the woodblessed has, with a `Reflex check` save against the woodblessed's spell DC.
