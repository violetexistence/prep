# (Skeleton) Bone Missile `pf2:2`

### 

**Category** offensive; 




The skeleton yanks a rib from its ribcage to use as an arrow or javelin. The skeleton loses HP equal to its level (minimum 1), then makes a ranged Strike.

This uses the attack bonus of whichever of the skeleton's other Strikes has the highest attack bonus and deals piercing damage equal to that Strike's damage plus the skeleton's level (minimum 1).
