# (Ghost) Malevolent Possession `pf2:2`

### [[incapacitation]][[mental]][[possession]]

**Category** offensive; 




The ghost attempts to possess an adjacent corporeal creature. This has the same effect as the [[Spells/Possession|Possession]] spell, except since the ghost doesn't have a physical body, it is unaffected by that restriction of the spell.

For DCs, use the high spell DC of the ghost's level.
