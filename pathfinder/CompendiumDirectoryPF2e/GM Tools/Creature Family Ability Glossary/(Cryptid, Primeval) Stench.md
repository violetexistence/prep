# (Cryptid, Primeval) Stench

### [[aura]][[olfactory]]

**Category** offensive; 




30 feet. A creature entering the emanation or starting its turn in the emanation must succeed at a `Fortitude check` save against the standard DC for the creature's level or become [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] (plus [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] as long as it's sickened on a critical failure). While within the emanation, affected creatures take a -2 circumstance penalty to saves against diseases and to recover from the sickened condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune for 1 minute.
