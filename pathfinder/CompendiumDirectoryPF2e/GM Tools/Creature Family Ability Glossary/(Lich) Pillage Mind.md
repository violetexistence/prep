# (Lich) Pillage Mind `pf2:r`

### [[arcane]][[mental]]

**Category** offensive; 




**Trigger** The lich deals damage with their hand Strike

* * *

**Effect** The lich pulls a memory or thought from the target's mind. The lich Recalls Information with a skill of their choice, using the target's bonus with the skill instead of their own. If there's a very specific piece of information the lich hopes to uncover, and the target knows that information, the target can attempt a `Will check` save to keep it secret. On a critical success, the target can give the lich faulty information instead.
