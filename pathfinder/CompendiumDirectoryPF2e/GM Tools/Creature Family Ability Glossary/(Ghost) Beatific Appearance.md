# (Ghost) Beatific Appearance `pf2:r`

### [[divine]]

**Category** defensive; 




**Requirements** A creature the ghost is aware of targets the ghost with an attack

* * *

**Effect** The ghost has an unusually pitiable appearance or can change its features to look like someone close to the attacker, which causes the target to pull back on its attack.

The triggering creature must attempt a `Will check` save. On a failure, the creature takes a -1 circumstance penalty to its attack roll (-2 on a critical failure).
