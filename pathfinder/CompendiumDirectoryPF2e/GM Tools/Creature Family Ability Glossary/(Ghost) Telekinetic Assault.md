# (Ghost) Telekinetic Assault `pf2:2`

### [[divine]]

**Category** offensive; 




The ghost cries out in pain and anguish as small objects and debris fly about in a 30-foot emanation. Creatures in this area take 1d6 bludgeoning damage + 1d6 per 2 levels, subject to a `Reflex check` save.

For DCs, use the high spell DC of the ghost's level.
