# (Vampire, True) Create Servitor

### [[divine]][[downtime]]

**Category** offensive; 




If a creature dies after being reduced to 0 HP by Drink Blood, the vampire can turn this victim into a vampire servitor by donating some of their own blood to the victim and burying the victim in earth for 3 nights.

A vampiric servitor is compelled to obey its creator, but if a vampire controls too many vampiric servitors at once (as determined by the GM), or if the servitor is a higher level than the vampire that created it, strong-willed servitors can free themselves by succeeding at a `Will check` saving throw against the vampire's Will DC.
