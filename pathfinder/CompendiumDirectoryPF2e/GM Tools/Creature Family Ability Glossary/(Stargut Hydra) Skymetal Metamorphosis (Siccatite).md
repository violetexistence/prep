# (Stargut Hydra) Skymetal Metamorphosis (Siccatite)

### 

**Category** defensive; 




Each stargut hydra has at least one metamorphosis resulting from consuming a specific skymetal and internalizing its properties.

**Siccatite** After the stargut hydra takes fire damage, it becomes superheated, gaining immunity to fire and weakness 10 to cold. While superheated, cold damage can be used to cauterize a stump. After the stargut hydra takes cold damage, it becomes chilled, gaining immunity to cold and weakness 10 to fire.
