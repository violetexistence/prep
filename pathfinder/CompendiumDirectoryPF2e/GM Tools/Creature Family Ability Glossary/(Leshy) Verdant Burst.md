# (Leshy) Verdant Burst

### [[healing]]

**Category** defensive; 




When the leshy dies, a burst of primal energy explodes from their body, restoring Hit Points based on the leshy's level to each plant creature in a 30-foot emanation. This area is filled with plants, becoming difficult terrain. If the terrain is not a viable environment for these plants, they wither after 24 hours.
