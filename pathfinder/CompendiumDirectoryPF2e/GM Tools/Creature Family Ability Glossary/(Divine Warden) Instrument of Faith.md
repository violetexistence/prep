# (Divine Warden) Instrument of Faith

### 

**Category** offensive; 




The divine warden is a beacon for its deity's faith. A cleric of the divine warden's patron deity can channel a [[Spells/Heal|Heal]] spell through a divine warden they can see within 60 feet. The cleric determines any targets or area for the spell as if they were standing in the divine warden's space.
