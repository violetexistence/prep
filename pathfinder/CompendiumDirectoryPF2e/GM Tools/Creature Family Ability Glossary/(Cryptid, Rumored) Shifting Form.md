# (Cryptid, Rumored) Shifting Form

### 

**Category** offensive; 




The cryptid is sustained by localized tales or reports from witnesses. As a result, its appearance morphs between different appearances. If all records of the rumored cryptid are destroyed or all witnesses die, the rumored cryptid ceases to exist.
