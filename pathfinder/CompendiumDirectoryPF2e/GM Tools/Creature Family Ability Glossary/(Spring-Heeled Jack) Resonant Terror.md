# (Spring-Heeled Jack) Resonant Terror `pf2:1`

### [[concentrate]][[curse]][[emotion]][[fear]][[mental]][[primal]]

**Category** offensive; 




Spring-Heeled Jack glares at a creature he can see within 30 feet. The target must immediately attempt a Will save (DC equal to the DC of Jack's Breath Weapon) or become [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]] ([[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] on a critical failure), and it can't reduce its frightened condition below 1 for 24 hours or until this curse is removed. After attempting its save, the creature is temporarily immune to this ability for 24 hours.
