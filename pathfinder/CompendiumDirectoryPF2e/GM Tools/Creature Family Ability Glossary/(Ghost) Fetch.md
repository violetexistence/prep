# (Ghost) Fetch `pf2:2`

### [[divine]][[illusion]]

**Category** interaction; 




The ghost creates an illusory double of a creature. The fetch functions as a 2nd-rank [[Spells/Illusory Creature|Illusory Creature]], except that the ghost doesn't control the fetch, and the spell lasts for 1d4 hours instead of needing to Sustain the Spell.

The fetch has a rudimentary intelligence and tries to imitate its original (it has a Deception skill value equal to the ghost's highest skill) but comes across as [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]] or vague.

A ghost can have only one fetch at a time. If the creature doubled by the fetch encounters it, the creature must succeed at a `Will check` save or become [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] ([[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] on a critical failure) for as long as they can see the fetch.
