# (Ghost) Corporeal Manifestation `pf2:1`

### [[concentrate]]

**Category** defensive; 




The ghost loses the incorporeal trait, temporarily increasing its Strength modifier to equal its Charisma modifier. The ghost loses its immunity to precision damage and its resistance to all damage while corporeal.

The ghost can resume being incorporeal by using this action again.
