# (Vampire, True) Mist Escape `pf2:0`

### 

**Category** defensive; 




**Trigger** The vampire is reduced to 0 HP.

* * *

**Effect** The vampire uses Turn to Mist. They can take move actions to move toward its coffin even though it's at 0 HP. While at 0 HP in this form, the vampire is unaffected by further damage.

They automatically returns to its corporeal form, unconscious, if they reaches their coffin or after 2 hours, whichever comes first.
