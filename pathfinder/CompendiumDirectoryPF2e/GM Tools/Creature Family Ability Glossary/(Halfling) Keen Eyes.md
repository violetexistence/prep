The halfling gains a +2 circumstance bonus when using the [[Actions/Seek|Seek]] action to find [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] or undetected creatures within 30 feet of them. Whenever the halfling targets a creature that is [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] or hidden from them, reduce the DC of the flat check to 3 for a concealed target or 9 for a hidden one.
