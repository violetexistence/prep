# (Cryptid, Rumored) Howl `pf2:2`

### [[auditory]][[emotion]][[fear]][[mental]]

**Category** offensive; 




The rumored cryptid calls out with a wretched sound no living creature should make. Each creature in a 30-foot emanation must attempt a `Will check` save. A creature that fails is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]] (or [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] on a critical failure). A creature that succeeds is temporarily immune for 1 minute. The DC is the high DC for a creature of the rumored cryptid's level.
