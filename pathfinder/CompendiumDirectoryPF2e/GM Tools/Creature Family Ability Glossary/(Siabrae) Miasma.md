# (Siabrae) Miasma

### [[aura]][[disease]][[primal]]

**Category** defensive; 




20 foot, DC equal to the siabrae's spell DC - 4.

* * *

A creature that enters the aura or begins its turn there becomes [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]] on a failure (or sickened 4 on a critical failure). An animal, fey, or plant that rolls a failure gets a critical failure instead. Regardless of the result of the saving throw, the creature is temporarily immune to the siabrae's miasma for 1 minute.
