# (Risen Nemesis) Indignant Curse `pf2:r`

### [[curse]]

**Category** offensive; 




**Trigger** The Risen Nemesis critically fails a save

* * *

**Effect** The Risen Nemesis curses the creature who created the triggering effect with bad luck by sneering or shouting a cutting insult. The triggering creature must attempt a `DC 42 Will check` save. On failure, the Risen Nemesis can reroll the triggering roll and take the better result of the two (a fortune effect); the cursed creature must make their next d20 roll twice and take the worse result (a misfortune effect).
