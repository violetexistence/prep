# (Melfesh Monster) Burrowing Grasp `pf2:2`

### 

**Category** offensive; 




The Melfesh Monster Burrows twice. At any point in this movement, it can shed a temporary fungal limb to grasp a creature within 10 feet. The creature must succeed at a `DC 21 Reflex check` save or be [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] for 1 round (on a critical failure, 2 rounds) or until it Escapes (DC 21). This ability grants the Melfesh Monster a burrow speed of 15 feet and replaces its fly speed and Envelop.
