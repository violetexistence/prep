# (Path Maiden) Scorn Fate `pf2:2`

### [[curse]][[misfortune]][[occult]]

**Category** offensive; 




The path maiden targets a creature she can see. The creature must attempt a Will save against the path maiden's spell DC. On a failure, the creature's next roll is cursed. If the result of the roll is a critical success, it becomes a regular success. A success becomes a failure, and a failure becomes a critical failure. That creature is then temporarily immune to Scorn Fate for 24 hours.
