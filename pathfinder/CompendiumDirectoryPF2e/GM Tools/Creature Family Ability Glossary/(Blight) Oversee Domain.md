# (Blight) Oversee Domain

### [[concentrate]][[primal]]

**Category** offensive; 




The blight projects its senses to any point in its cursed domain, gaining a precise sense of its surroundings with a 500-foot radius until the end of its next turn. A blight can cast [[Spells/Dominate|Dominate]] through this sensory link. A blight can Sustain this ability, but cannot use it to extend its senses beyond the edges of its domain.
