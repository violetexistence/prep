# (Ghost) Corrupting Gaze `pf2:2`

### 

**Category** offensive; 




The ghost stares at a creature it can see within 30 feet. The target takes 1d6 void damage + 1d6 per 2 levels with a `Will check` save.

A creature that fails its save is also [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] for 1 minute.

For DCs, use the high spell DC of the ghost's level.
