# (Vampire, Vrykolakas Master) Create Spawn

### [[divine]][[downtime]]

**Category** offensive; 




If a creature dies after being reduced to 0 HP by Drink Blood, a vrykolakas master can turn this creature into a [[Bestiary 2/Vrykolakas Spawn|Vrykolakas Spawn]] by donating some of its own blood to the creature and burying it in earth for 3 nights.

Such vrykolakas spawn are generally friendly to the vrykolakas that created them, but they are not under its control and typically wander off on their own rampage within 1d6 days of their creation.
