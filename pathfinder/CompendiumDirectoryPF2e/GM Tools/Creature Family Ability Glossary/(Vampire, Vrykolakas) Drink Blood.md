# (Vampire, Vrykolakas) Drink Blood `pf2:1`

### [[divine]]

**Category** offensive; 




**Requirements** The vrykolakas' last action was a successful fangs Strike

* * *

**Effect** The vrykolakas sinks its fangs into that creature to drink its blood. This requires an `Athletics check` check against the creature's Fortitude DC. On a success, the creature becomes [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]] ([[Conditions/Drained|Drained 2]] if a vrykolakas master uses this action), and the vrykolakas regains HP equal to 10% of its maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the vampire, but it increases the creature's drained condition value by 1. A vrykolakas can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but it gains no HP from doing so.

The target creature's drained condition value decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a successful `DC 20 Medicine check` check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drained value by 1 after 10 minutes.
