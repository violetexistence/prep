# (Secret Society) Prepared Trap `pf2:1`

### 

**Category** offensive; 




**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

**Effect** The secret society member's agents trapped the area in advance, and the secret society member arms one such snare. The secret society member chooses an unoccupied space within 60 feet and activates a snare hidden there; the snare can be any common snare of the secret society's member's level - 2 or lower (minimum level 1). From this point on, creatures can trigger the snare as normal. During the activation, the secret society member must attempt a `Deception check` check against the Perception DCs of creatures observing them; on a failure, those creatures realize where the secret society member activated the snare.
