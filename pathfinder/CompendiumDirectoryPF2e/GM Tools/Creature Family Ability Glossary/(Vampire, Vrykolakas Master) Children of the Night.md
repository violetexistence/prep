# (Vampire, Vrykolakas Master) Children of the Night

### [[divine]][[mental]]

**Category** interaction; 




The presence of a vrykolakas master inspires savage creatures to crawl forth to do its bidding, including [[Monster Core/Rat Swarm|Rat Swarms]], [[Monster Core/Warg|Wargs]], [[Monster Core/Werewolf|Werewolves]], and similar creatures.

The vrykolakas master can give telepathic orders to these creatures within 100 feet, but they can't communicate back.
