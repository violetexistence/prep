**Category** interaction; 




A jiang-shi can't perceive living creatures beyond 5 feet except with their breathsense. A living creature within the listed range who holds its breath is [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]] to the jiang-shi for as long as it holds its breath. To hold its breath in this way, a creature must have one hand free to fully plug its nose or cover its mouth.
