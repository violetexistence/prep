# (Siabrae) Stony Shards

### [[curse]][[earth]][[incapacitation]][[primal]]

**Category** offensive; 




Tiny shards break off the siabrae's antlers when they attack, lodging in the target's wounds and inflicting a terrible curse. A creature damaged by a siabrae's stone antlers Strike must succeed at a `Fortitude check` save against the siabrae's spell DC - 4 or become [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 2]] for 1d4 rounds on a failure. If the creature critically fails, or fails while already clumsy 2 or greater, the creature is petrified.
