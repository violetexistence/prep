# (Nymph Queen) Focus Beauty `pf2:1`

### [[emotion]][[mental]][[primal]][[visual]]

**Category** offensive; 




The nymph queen focuses her beauty upon a target, who must attempt a save against her nymph's beauty aura (`DC 0 Will check` save). If the creature fails and was already affected by the aura, it takes a greater effect described in the nymph queen's entry.

A nymph queen can Focus Beauty on a given creature only once per turn.
