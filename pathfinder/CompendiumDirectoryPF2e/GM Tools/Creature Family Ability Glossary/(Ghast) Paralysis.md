# (Ghast) Paralysis

### [[incapacitation]][[occult]]

**Category** offensive; 




Any living creature hit by a ghast's attack must succeed at a `Fortitude check` save or become [[Conditions/Paralyzed|Paralyzed]]. It can attempt a new save at the end of each of its turns, and the DC cumulatively decreases by 1 on each such save.
