# (Divine Warden) Faith Bound

### [[divine]]

**Category** defensive; 




A divine warden can't attack a creature that openly wears or displays the religious symbol of the divine warden's patron deity unless that creature uses a hostile action against the divine warden first. If the divine warden is intelligent, it can also attack a creature it believes isn't faithful to its deity or who wears the religious symbol as a ruse (typically after succeeding at a Perception check to [[Actions/Sense Motive|Sense Motive]]).
