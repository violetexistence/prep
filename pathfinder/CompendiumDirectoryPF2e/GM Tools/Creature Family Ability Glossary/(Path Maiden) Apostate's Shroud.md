# (Path Maiden) Apostate's Shroud

### 

**Category** offensive; 




All path maidens have an apostate's shroud unarmed attack that deals mental damage. This attack, which manifests as a whipping lash from the path maiden's sleeves or hem, has the agile, finesse, and magical traits. A creature damaged by this attack must succeed at a Fortitude save against the path maiden's spell DC. On a failure, the creature becomes cursed for 1 hour; if the creature dies while cursed, it immediately rises from death as a ghost. If the creature is a lower level than the path maiden that cursed it, it treats that path maiden as an ally and loyally obeys her; otherwise, it manifests as a free-willed ghost. In either case, it becomes site bound to the site of their death.
