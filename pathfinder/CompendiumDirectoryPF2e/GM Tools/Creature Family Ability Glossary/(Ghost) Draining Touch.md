# (Ghost) Draining Touch `pf2:2`

### 

**Category** offensive; 




With a touch, the ghost attempts to drain a living creature's life force. It makes a ghostly hand Strike but deals no damage on a hit.

Instead, the target becomes [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]] for 1 day, and the ghost regains HP equal to half its own level.
