# (Ravener) Cowering Fear

### [[aura]][[emotion]][[fear]][[mental]]

**Category** defensive; 




0 feet. `Will check`

A ravener's frightful presence causes creatures to cower in fear as well. As long as a creature is at least [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] or more as a result of the ravener's frightful presence, it is also [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] from the fear.

A creature that first enters the area must attempt a Will save.

Regardless of the result of the saving throw, the creature is temporarily immune to this monster's Frightful Presence for 1 minute.

**Success** The creature is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]].

**Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]].

**Critical Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 4]].
