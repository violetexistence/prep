### [[arcane]][[summon]]

**Category** offensive; 




HP __; AC __, Fort +__, Ref +__, Will +__

* * *

The graveknight summons a supernatural mount, as [[Spells/Marvelous Mount|Marvelous Mount]] heightened to a rank equal to half the graveknight's level. Unlike _marvelous mount_, the steed's AC and saving throw bonuses are all 4 lower than the graveknight's, and the steed has one-third the graveknight's Hit Points (rounded down).

If the steed is destroyed, the graveknight must wait 1 hour before using this ability again.
