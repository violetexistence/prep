# (Blight) Rejuvenation

### [[primal]]

**Category** offensive; 




If a blight is slain within its cursed domain, its body melts into the surrounding environment and a new blight of the same type spontaneously forms in 1d10 days at the cursed domain's epicenter unless the curse is removed before then. The new blight retains all the memories of the previous blight.
