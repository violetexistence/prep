# (Zombie) Ankle Biter

### 

**Category** offensive; 




This zombie fights just as well on the ground as it does standing. While [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]], the zombie isn't [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]], it ignores the status penalty to its attack rolls, and it gains a +2 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks to [[Actions/Trip|Trip]]. The zombie can also move up to half its Speed when it Crawls.
