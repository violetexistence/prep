# (Ravener) Vicious Criticals

### 

**Category** offensive; 




The ravener treats an attack roll as a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20, as long as the attack roll was a success. Additionally, whenever the ravener makes a critical hit with one of their Strikes, the target must succeed on a `Fortitude check` save or gain the [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]] condition. If the target already has a drained value of greater than 0, their drained value instead increases by 1, to a maximum of drained 4.

Whenever the ravener applies drain to a creature in this way, their soul ward gains 5 Hit Points.
