# (Vampire, Nosferatu) Dominate `pf2:2`

### [[divine]][[incapacitation]][[mental]][[visual]]

**Category** offensive; 




The nosferatu can cast [[Spells/Dominate|Dominate]] at will as a divine innate spell. Casting it requires staring into the target's eyes, giving the spell the visual trait (`Will check`). The save DC uses a high DC for the nosferatu's level, and a creature that succeeds is temporarily immune to that nosferatu's Dominate for 24 hours. Fully destroying the nosferatu ends the domination, but merely reducing the nosferatu to 0 HP is insufficient to break the spell.
