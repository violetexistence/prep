# (Failed Prophet) Taboos

### 

**Category** defensive; 




Despite the failed prophet's transformed body, a lifelong adherence to the strictures of the Prophecies of Kalistrade has ingrained the philosophical prohibitions into their soul. Whenever a failed prophet is critically hit by an unarmed attack, is critically hit by or critically fails a save against a touch spell, or is exposed to a disease or poison effect (even though immune), they take a â€“2 status penalty to their AC, attack bonuses, DCs, Perception, saving throws, and skill modifiers for 1 minute. Breaking other Kalistocratic taboos can also trigger this penalty at the GM's discretion.
