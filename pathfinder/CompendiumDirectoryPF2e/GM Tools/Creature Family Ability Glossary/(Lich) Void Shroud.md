# (Lich) Void Shroud

### [[aura]][[death]]

**Category** defensive; 




30 feet. The lich is surrounded by an aura of death, drawing forth souls to be consumed by the lich's constant hunger.

Living creatures in the emanation take a -2 status penalty to saves against fear and death effects. In addition, any creature that starts its turn in the area gains the [[Conditions/Doomed|Doomed 1]] condition unless it succeeds at a `Will check` save against the lich's spell DC-4.
