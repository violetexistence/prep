# (Werecreature) Curse of the Werecreature

### [[curse]][[primal]]

**Category** offensive; 




This curse affects only humanoids.

* * *

**Saving Throw** `Fortitude check` DC is the moderate spell DC for the werecreature's new level.

On each full moon, the cursed creature must succeed at another Fortitude save or turn into the same kind of werecreature until dawn.

The creature is under the GM's control and goes on a rampage for half the night before falling unconscious until dawn.
