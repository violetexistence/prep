# (Martial Artist) Blazing Gate `pf2:2`

### [[electricity]]

**Category** offensive;

**Effect** The grandmaster tosses their target upwards and electrocutes them with a qi-infused double palm strike as they land. The target becomes [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]], loses the grappled or restrained condition, and takes 5d6 bludgeoning and 2d8 persistent electricity damage (`DC 38 Fortitude check` save).
