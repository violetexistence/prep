# (Floodslain) Drowning Touch

### [[occult]]

**Category** offensive; 




When the floodslain creature damages a creature with a non-weapon melee attack, the target's lungs begin to fill with water. The target must attempt a `Fortitude check` save against the floodslain's Will DC. A target affected by Drowning Touch can spend a single action coughing in an attempt to recover, which immediately lets them attempt a new Fortitude save against the effect. A success improves the previous result by 1 step. A critical success improves the previous result by 2, and a critical failure decreases it by 1.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature is [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] for 1 round.

**Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 2]] for 1 round.

**Critical Failure** The creature is slowed 2 and drowning.
