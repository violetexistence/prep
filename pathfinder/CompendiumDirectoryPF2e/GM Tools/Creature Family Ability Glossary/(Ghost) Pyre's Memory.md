# (Ghost) Pyre's Memory `pf2:3`

### [[divine]][[fire]]

**Category** offensive; 




The ghost causes great gouts of flame to erupt without warning.

The ghost picks three 5-foot squares within 30 feet. Creatures that start in or enter one of these squares take 1d6 fire damage per 2 levels the ghost has, subject to a `Reflex check` save.

The flames last for 1 minute and don't set other things alight unless the ghost wishes. If the ghost uses this ability again, it dismisses any existing flames.
