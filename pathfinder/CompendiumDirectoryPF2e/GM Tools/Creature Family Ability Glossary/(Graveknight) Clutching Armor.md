# (Graveknight) Clutching Armor `pf2:r`

### [[arcane]]

**Category** defensive; 




**Trigger** A creature attempts to move away from the graveknight

* * *

**Effect** The graveknight's armor animates and attempts to Grab the triggering creature. It makes an Athletics check to [[Actions/Grapple|Grapple]] using the graveknight's Athletics modifier - 2. The armor can continue to Grapple the creature normally.

Since the armor is grappling the creature, the graveknight doesn't need a free hand to do so.
