# (Blackfrost Dead) Shattering Death

### [[cold]]

**Category** offensive; 




When the blackfrost dead is destroyed, its body shatters like brittle ice, filling the air around it with a cloud of frigid, razor-sharp ice shards. Creatures in a 10-foot emanation take 1d8 cold per level of the blackfrost dead (minimum 3d8), with a `Reflex check` save. Creatures that critically fail this save also take 1d6 bleed.
