# (Vampire, Nosferatu Thrall) Mindbound

### 

**Category** offensive; 




A nosferatu master exerts a fierce hold over their thrall's mind. If any creature other than the thrall's master targets them with an effect that would give them the [[Conditions/Controlled|Controlled]] condition, the thrall's master rolls a counteract check against it using their Dominate DC - 10 as the counteract check modifier.
