# (Skeleton) Screaming Skull `pf2:2`

### [[auditory]][[emotion]][[fear]][[mental]]

**Category** offensive; 




The skeleton removes its skull and throws it, making a jaws attack with a range of 20 feet. It then attempts to [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] each foe within 10 feet of the target.

The head bounces, rolls, or even flies back, returning to the skeleton at the start of its next turn. The skeleton is [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] until then.
