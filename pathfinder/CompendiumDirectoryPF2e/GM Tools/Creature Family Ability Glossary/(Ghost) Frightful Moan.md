# (Ghost) Frightful Moan `pf2:1`

### [[auditory]][[divine]][[emotion]][[fear]][[mental]]

**Category** offensive; 




The ghost laments its fate, forcing each living creature within 30 feet to attempt a `Will check` save. On a failure, a creature becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] (or [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 3]] on a critical failure). On a success, a creature is temporarily immune to this ghost's frightful moan for 1 minute.

For DCs, use the high spell DC of the ghost's level.
