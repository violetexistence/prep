# (Mana Wastes Mutant) Grasping Tentacle

### 

**Category** offensive; 




The mutant grows a writhing, serpentine appendage, granting them a tentacle Strike (an agile unarmed attack that deals bludgeoning damage), and the [[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Grab|Grab]] ability with that Strike. If they had any agile attacks, the damage dealt by their tentacle should be roughly the same as the damage dealt by those attacks. If they had only non-agile attacks, their tentacle should deal three-quarters that damage.
