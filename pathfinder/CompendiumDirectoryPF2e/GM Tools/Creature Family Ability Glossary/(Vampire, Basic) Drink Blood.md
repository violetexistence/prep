# (Vampire, Basic) Drink Blood `pf2:1`

### [[divine]]

**Category** offensive; 




**Requirement** A [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]], [[Conditions/Paralyzed|Paralyzed]], [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]], [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]], or willing creature is within the vampire's reach.

* * *

**Effect** The vampire sinks its fangs into that creature to drink its blood. This requires an `Athletics check` check against the victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions.

The victim is [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]] and the vampire regains HP equal to 10% of its maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the vampire but increases the victim's drained value by 1, killing the victim when it reaches drained 5. A vampire can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but it gains no HP from doing so.

A victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a `DC 20 Medicine check` check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drain by 1 after 10 minutes.
