# (Path Maiden) Vengeful Frenzy `pf2:2`

### [[emotion]][[mental]][[occult]]

**Category** offensive; 




The path maiden targets a creature within 60 feet that she can see. The target must attempt a Will save against the path maiden's spell DC. On a failure, the target is [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]] until the end of its next turn, but it can't attack path maidens or itself as the result of this confusion.
