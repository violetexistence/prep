# (Divine Warden) Faithful Weapon

### 

**Category** offensive; 




A divine warden always wields its patron deity's favored weapon. If the weapon is a ranged weapon, the divine warden automatically generates new ammunition with each attack. For a divine warden of 4th level or higher, the deity's favored weapon gains the effects of a _[[Equipment/Striking|Striking]]_ rune while the divine warden wields it; at 12th level, these effects are of a _[[Equipment/Striking (Greater)|Greater Striking]]_ rune, and at 19th level, they're instead of a _[[Equipment/Striking (Major)|Major Striking]]_ rune.
