# (Blight) Blight Domination

### 

**Category** offensive; 




All blights can cast [[Spells/Dominate|Dominate]] as an innate primal spell but can target only animals, beasts, fungi, oozes, or plants that are located inside their cursed domain. If a creature dominated by this spell leaves the cursed domain, the effects of _dominate_ immediately end, but as long as the dominated creature remains in the cursed domain, the duration is unlimited. When a blight targets a mindless fungi, ooze, or plant, its _dominate_ spell loses the mental trait.
