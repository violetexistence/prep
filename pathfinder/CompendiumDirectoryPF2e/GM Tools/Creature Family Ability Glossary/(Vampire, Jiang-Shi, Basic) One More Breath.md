# (Vampire, Jiang-Shi, Basic) One More Breath

### [[divine]][[void]]

**Category** defensive; 




Unlike other undead, a jiang-shi isn't destroyed at 0 HP. Instead, they fall [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]] and awaken in 1 minute with 1 Hit Point. Scattering at least 1 Bulk of glutinous rice or hen eggs on an unconscious jiang-shi destroys them permanently. If the jiang-shi was reduced to 0 HP by an attack from a weapon made of duskwood, they're destroyed immediately.
