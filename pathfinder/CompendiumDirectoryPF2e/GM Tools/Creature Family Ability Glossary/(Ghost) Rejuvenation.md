# (Ghost) Rejuvenation

### [[divine]]

**Category** defensive; 




When a ghost is destroyed, it re-forms after 2d4 days within the location it's bound to, fully healed. A ghost can be permanently destroyed only if someone determines the reason for its existence and sets right whatever prevents the spirit from resting.
