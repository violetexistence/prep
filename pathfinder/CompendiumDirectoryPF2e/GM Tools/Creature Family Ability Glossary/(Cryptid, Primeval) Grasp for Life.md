# (Cryptid, Primeval) Grasp for Life `pf2:0`

### [[healing]]

**Category** offensive; 




**Frequency** once per week

**Trigger** The primeval cryptid would be reduced to 0 Hit Points

* * *

**Effect** The cryptid's will to live is second nature, and its second wind has allowed it to survive when others of its kind went extinct. The creature shrugs off death. Instead of being reduced to 0 Hit Points, its Hit Points become equal to four times its level (or 4 Hit Points for a level 0 creature).
