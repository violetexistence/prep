# (Woodblessed) Tap Planar Gate `pf2:1`

### [[concentrate]][[primal]]

**Category** offensive; 




The woodblessed empowers themself or their next attack.

If the woodblessed's next action is to Stride, is launched off the ground by a suddenly sprouting tree and propelled forward. During this Stride, they have a fly Speed equal to their Speed. If they don't end their movement on a solid surface that can support their weight, they fall.

If the woodblessed's next action is a Strike, the attack sprouts thorns that deal an additional 1d4 persistent bleed damage (1d6 for levels 6â€“12, 1d10 for levels 13+).
