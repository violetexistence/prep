# (Ghast) Stench

### [[aura]][[olfactory]]

**Category** defensive; 




10 feet. A creature entering the aura or starting its turn in the aura must succeed at a `Fortitude check` save or become [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] (plus [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] as long as it's sickened on a critical failure).

While within the aura, the creature takes a -2 circumstance penalty to saves against disease and to recover from the sickened condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune for 1 minute.
