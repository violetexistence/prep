# (Graveknight) Devastating Blast `pf2:2`

### [[arcane]]

**Category** offensive; 




The graveknight unleashes a 30-foot cone of energy. Creatures in the area take limited use area damage for a creature of the graveknight's level with a `Reflex check` based on a high DC of the graveknight's level.

The graveknight can use this ability once every 1d4 rounds.

This energy damage is of the same type as that of their ruinous weapons, and Devastating Blast gains the associated trait.
