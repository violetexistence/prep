# (Secret Society) Connected

### 

**Category** interaction; 




The secret society member has numerous connections, especially within the broad band of social class from which the society recruits, but stretching further through friendships, extortion, and other forms of influence. Whenever encountering a character from a settlement where the secret society has influence, the secret society member can attempt a Society check with an easy DC for the level of the encountered character if that character is a member of the demographic from which the secret society recruits, and a DC of hard or higher for other characters.
