# (Vampire, Jiang-Shi, Minister) Dark Enlightenment

### 

**Category** defensive; 




The jiang-shi is no longer limited to seeing living creatures with only their breathsense, and they no longer have the Revulsion vulnerability. They can perceive living creatures normally with either darkvision or breathsense, and they can take the [[Actions/Drop Prone|Drop Prone]] action.
