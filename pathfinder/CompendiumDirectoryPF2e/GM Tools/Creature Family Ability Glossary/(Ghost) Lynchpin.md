# (Ghost) Lynchpin

### [[divine]]

**Category** interaction; 




The ghost extends some of its nature to one or more undead of equal or lower level, who are connected to the ghost's story and unfinished business.

These undead gain the ghost's [[Creature Family Ability Glossary/(Ghost) Rejuvenation|Rejuvenation]] ability and can't be permanently destroyed so long as the ghost exists. If the ghost is laid to rest, all linked undead are likewise instantly destroyed.

Linked undead often, but not always, share the ghost's [[Creature Family Ability Glossary/(Ghost) Site Bound|Site Bound]] ability as well. The ghost doesn't have any control over such undead, and indeed the ghost and their partners in eternity may be unremittingly hostile to one another.
