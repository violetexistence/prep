# (Melfesh Monster) Smolderstench

### [[aura]][[olfactory]][[poison]]

**Category** offensive; 




60 feet. The Melfesh Monster emits the overwhelming stink of burning, rotting matter. A creature that enters or begins its turn in the area inhales spores and must attempt a `DC 21 Fortitude check` save. On a failure, the creature takes 2d4 poison damage and is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]]; on a critical failure, the creature also takes 4 persistent poison damage and is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]]. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune to smolderstench for 1 minute. This ability replaces terrorspores.
