# (Vampire, Jiang-Shi, Basic) Jiang-Shi Vulnerabilities

### 

**Category** defensive; 




All jiang-shi possess the following vulnerabilities.

*   **Revulsion** A jiang-shi can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of a brandished mirror or the sound of ringing handbells. A creature can Interact with a mirror or handbell to brandish or ring the item for 1 round (similar to Raising a Shield). If the jiang-shi involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of their revulsion, they gain the [[Conditions/Fleeing|Fleeing]] condition, running from the object of their revulsion until they are 10 feet or farther from the object. After 1 round of being exposed to the object of their revulsion, a jiang-shi can attempt a `DC 25 Will check` save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, they overcome their revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success).
*   **Bitter Epiphany** A jiang-shi is afflicted by severe melancholia when reminded of their debased nature and the truth of their existential disconnection from living beings. When a jiang-shi sees an altar with at least 1 Bulk of food offerings to ancestor spirits, they must attempt a `DC 25 Will check` save. They are then temporarily immune to Bitter Epiphany for 1 minute.

* * *

**Critical Success** The jiang-shi is unaffected.

**Success** The jiang-shi is [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] for 1 round.

**Failure** The jiang-shi is [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] for 1 minute.

**Critical Failure** The jiang-shi is stupefied 2 and [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]] for 1 minute.
