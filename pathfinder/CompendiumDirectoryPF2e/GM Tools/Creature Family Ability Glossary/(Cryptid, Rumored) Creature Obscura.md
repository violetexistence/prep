# (Cryptid, Rumored) Creature Obscura

### 

**Category** offensive; 




The cryptid appears in so many urban legends, it can be identified using Society or a Lore skill connected to a nearby settlement, in addition to the normal skills. However, much of the information known about it is dubious. The DC to identify a rumored cryptid is incredibly hard (rather than very hard for most rare creatures), but all failures to identify a rumored cryptid gain the effects of the [[Feats/Dubious Knowledge|Dubious Knowledge]] skill feat.
