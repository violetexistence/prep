# (Failed Prophet) Greedy Grab `pf2:1`

### 

**Category** offensive; 




**Requirements** The failed prophet's last action was a successful fist Strike that dealt damage

* * *

**Effect** The failed prophet attempts a Thievery check against the target's Reflex DC. On a success, the failed prophet pilfers coins and gems from the target with a total value as indicated in the table, to a maximum of what the target is carrying. Valuables in unlocked containers on the target's person can be taken just as easily as those carried. On a critical success, the failed prophet steals double that amount. The failed prophet gains a number of temporary Hit Points equal to the value stolen that last for 1 minute.

| 13–15 | 6d10 gp |
| 16–18 | 7d10 gp |
| 19–20 | 8d10 gp |
