# (Sporeborn) Consume Biomatter

### [[manipulate]]

**Category** offensive; 




If the sporeborn is adjacent to a helpless or [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]] creature, or a deceased creature who died in the past hour, the sporeborn can consume its flesh with mycelium tendrils to heal itself. This restores an amount of Hit Points equal to the sporeborn's level. If the creature is alive, the sporeborn deals damage equal to one of its unarmed attacks.
