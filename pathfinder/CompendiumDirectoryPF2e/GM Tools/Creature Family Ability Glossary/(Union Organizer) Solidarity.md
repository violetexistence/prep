# (Union Organizer) Solidarity

### [[aura]]

**Category** defensive; 




10 feet.

While leading a demonstration, the union organizer grants themself and their allies a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against fatigue and mental effects. Greater numbers amplify the effect. The emanation increases to 20 feet if there are at least 5 allies within 10 feet, and to 30 feet if there are at least 10 allies within 20 feet.
