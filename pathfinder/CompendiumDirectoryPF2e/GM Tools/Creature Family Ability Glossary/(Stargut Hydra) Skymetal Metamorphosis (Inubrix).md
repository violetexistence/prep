# (Stargut Hydra) Skymetal Metamorphosis (Inubrix)

### 

**Category** defensive; 




Each stargut hydra has at least one metamorphosis resulting from consuming a specific skymetal and internalizing its properties.

**Inubrix** The stargut hydra's Strikes ignore resistance to damage from metal armor's armor specialization effects and do not trigger the Shield Block reaction or reactions from armor property runes.
