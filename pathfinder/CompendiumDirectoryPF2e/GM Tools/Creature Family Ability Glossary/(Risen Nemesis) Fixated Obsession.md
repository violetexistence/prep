# (Risen Nemesis) Fixated Obsession `pf2:2`

### [[emotion]][[mental]]

**Category** offensive; 




**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** The Risen Nemesis expresses a vengeful interest in a target within 30 feet. The creature must succeed at a `DC 42 Will check` save or become [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] for 1 minute ([[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]] on a critical failure). On failure or critical failure, the Risen Nemesis also gains a +2 status bonus on Strikes and damage rolls against the target until the target or the Risen Nemesis dies, whichever comes first.
