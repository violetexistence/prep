# Warpwaves
<p>Many proteans can subject their foes to disorienting alterations perceived in time and space by creating ripples of unstable reality in the environment called warpwaves.</p>
<p>When a creature fails its saving throw and is affected by a warpwave, roll 1d8 and consult the table below for the specific effect on that creature.</p>
<p>Unless indicated otherwise, a warpwave effect lasts for [[/gmr 1d4 #rounds]]{1d4 rounds}, and a new warpwave effect negates any previous warpwave effect already affecting a creature.</p>

| 1d8 | result |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Clumsy 2 (Clumsy 3 on a critical failure) |
| 2 | Confused and gains 4d6 temporary Hit Points |
| 3 | Dazzled (permanent on a critical failure) |
| 4 | Enfeebled 2 (Enfeebled 3 on a critical failure) |
| 5 | Immobilized by filaments of energy |
| 6 | Quickened (Stride, Strike, or Step only) |
| 7 | Slowed 1 |
| 8 | Stupefied 2 (Stupefied 3 on a critical failure) |
