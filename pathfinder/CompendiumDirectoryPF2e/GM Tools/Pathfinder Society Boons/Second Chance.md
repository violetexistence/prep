# Second Chance
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** pfsboon; 




**Cost**: 40 AcP

Second Chance (Limited-Use): Adventuring is deadly business, but you have a powerful favor you can call in if your travels result in a premature death. You can check the box that precedes this boon to gain the benefits of the resurrect ritual (Pathfinder Core Rulebook page 415) for your PC or a non-summoned minion (such as a creature companion), so long as the ritual's total cost in diamonds does not exceed 1,000 gp. If the ritual would cost more than 1,000 gp, you must pay any additional material costs beyond 1,000 gp.

The ritual takes 1 day to perform and automatically succeeds. If necessary, the Pathfinder Society will also recover your body and all lost equipment in the event it has been destroyed, lost, or is otherwise inaccessible without additional cost.

If the beneficiary is an undead character who does not die at 0 Hit Points (such as a character built using the skeleton ancestry), they can instead use this boon to benefit from a ritual that restores them to their previous undead state, instead of returning them to life. This ritual otherwise has the same costs and function as the resurrect ritual as described above.
