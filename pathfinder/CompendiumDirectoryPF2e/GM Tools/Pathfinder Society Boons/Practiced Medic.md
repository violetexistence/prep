# Practiced Medic
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** pfsboon; 



**Prerequisites** Liked by Radiant Oath
* * *
**Cost**: 4 AcP

* * *

By spending your off-hours administering medical aid to those in need, you have developed extraordinary first aid instincts. After purchasing this boon, you can spend Downtime to provide medical services to others. Once you have expended 8 days of Downtime in this way, you can expend the boon as a free action before attempting a Medicine check to Administer First Aid, Treat Disease, Treat Poison, or Treat Wounds. You improve your check's degree of success by one step (such as if you roll a failure, you get a success instead); the boon is not expended if your original roll is a critical success. Once you expend this boon, it provides no other benefit.

**Special** You can purchase this boon multiple times, though you cannot expend more than one copy of this boon per adventure.
