## Feat 1

**\[Generic\]\[Limited Use\]**

You vanquished the spirits of Warlock's Barrow, and now through some quirk of fate, you can call upon them to help you lay other undead to rest.

**Action** Two Actions

**Effect** The purified waters of Warlock's Barrow surround your weapons, now harming the undead instead of the living. You cast disrupting weapons as a 1st-rank innate spell, except the spell also has the water trait.
