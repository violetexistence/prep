# S2-00 - Spark of Life (levels 1-2)
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** pfsboon; 




**â–¡ Spark of Life** A seed has been planted in the fey demiplane known as the Lodge of the Open Road. Inside this seed is a tiny spark of your essence. If you die during an adventure, check the box next to this boon to reduce the gold or material cost of a raise dead ritual to restore you to life by 50%. This ritual automatically succeeds (but cannot critically succeed). This boon does not stack with other boons which affect raise dead.
