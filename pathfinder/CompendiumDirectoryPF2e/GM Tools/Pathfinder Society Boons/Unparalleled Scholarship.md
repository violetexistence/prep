# Unparalleled Scholarship
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** pfsboon; 




**\[Slotless\]**

**Prerequisites** Tier 4 with the Grand Archive

**Cost** 8 Fame

* * *

**Effect** Through a combination of your own research and the access to rare resources through the Grand Archive, you have identified an exceptional research opportunity-one that you can't decipher on your own. You have recruited a promising new agent to help research and publish your findings, which gives your assistant an extraordinary edge in their training.

When you purchase this boon, select one of your Pathfinder Society characters with 12 or fewer XP who is not a field commissioned agent. That character gains one additional point to assign to their school training, for a total of 4 points.
