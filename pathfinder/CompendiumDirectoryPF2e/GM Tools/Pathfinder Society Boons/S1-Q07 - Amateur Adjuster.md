**Effect** With the claim settled, you've shored up relationships with some valuable allies and learned a bit about navigating Druman bureaucracy. Whenever you attempt a check to Gather Information, Decipher Writing, or Create a Forgery, you can check a box next to this boon to gain a +1 circumstance bonus on the check. If the check involves interacting with a Druman business or Druman bureaucracy, you instead gain a +3 circumstance bonus on the check.
