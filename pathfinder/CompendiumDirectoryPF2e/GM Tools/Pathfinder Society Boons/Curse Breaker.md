# Curse Breaker
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** pfsboon; 



**Prerequisites** Admired by Vigilant Seal

**Cost**: 4 AcP

You have been entrusted with an accursed item from the Society's vaults, and you can spend your time in the Grand Lodge patiently unraveling its malign influence. When you acquire this boon, choose a permanent magic item of your level or lower to which you have access. You can spend Downtime erasing the item's stubborn curse. This uses the same rules as you would to Craft the item, with the following exceptions. First, you must use Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion in place of Crafting for all purposes. Second, you only need to spend 2 days of Downtime before attempting your first skill check and subsequently beginning to reduce the item's effective cost.

You can uncurse more than one magic item with this boon, but you must finish uncursing one item before beginning the next.
