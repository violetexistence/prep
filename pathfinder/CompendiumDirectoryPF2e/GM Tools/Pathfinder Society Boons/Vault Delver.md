**Effect** Your mastery of the contents of the Pathfinder vaults has helped you locate unusual items, which you can pass along to one of your assistants as a reward for their aid. Pick one uncommon item that your character has access to and select 1 of your Pathfinder Society characters with 12 or fewer XP. That character gains access to that item as if it appeared on their Chronicle sheet.
