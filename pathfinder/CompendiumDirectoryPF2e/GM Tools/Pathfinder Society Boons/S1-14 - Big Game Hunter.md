**Effect** Your struggles against the fearsome wildlife of Katapesh and the being manipulating the creatures has made you particularly good at dealing with dangerous animals. Whenever you roll a critical failure on a check to [[Actions/Track|Track]] an animal, you can check a box next to this boon to get a failure instead.
