# S2-03 - Fluent in Cyclops
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** pfsboon; 




You've come into contact with cyclopes or their cultural artifacts, and you get the sense that you could pick up their language with a bit of study. You gain access to the Cyclops language, allowing you to learn Cyclops the next time you gain a language (such as through the Multilingual skill feat).

**SPECIAL** This boon applies to all of your Pathfinder Society (second edition) characters.
