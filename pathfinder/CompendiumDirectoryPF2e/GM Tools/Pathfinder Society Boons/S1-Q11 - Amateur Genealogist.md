# S1-Q11 - Amateur Genealogist
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** pfsboon; 




**\[General\]****\[Limited Use\]****□****□**

* * *

**Effect** Your efforts assisting Venture-Captain Qaradi have given you some insights into family trees. Immediately after the venture-captain briefing in a scenario, you can check a box next to this boon to increase your proficiency in either Genealogy Lore or Heraldry lore by 1 step until the end of the scenario: untrained becomes trained, trained becomes expert, and expert becomes master. You can't increase your proficiency to legendary using this boon, and the effects of this boon aren't cumulative with any other temporary proficiency increases to the associated skills.
