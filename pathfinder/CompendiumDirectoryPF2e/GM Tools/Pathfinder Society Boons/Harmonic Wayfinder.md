# Harmonic Wayfinder `pf2:0`
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** pfsboon; 



**Prerequisites** Liked by Envoy's Alliance
* * *
**Cost**: 4 AcP

**Effect** You have modified your [[Equipment/Wayfinder|Wayfinder]] to resonate with your allies' actions, allowing you to better help them in times of need. When you purchase this boon, you apply its benefits to one wayfinder in your possession, granting you a special free action ability when the wayfinder is invested and in your possession.

You can activate this ability as a free action before you Aid an ally. If you roll a success on the check to Aid, you instead get a critical success.

You can safely use this benefit once per adventure. You can attempt to use it a second time, overcharging the wayfinder at the risk of destroying it. When you do so, roll a `DC 10 Flat check`. On a success, the wayfinder is broken. On a failure, the wayfinder is destroyed. If anyone tries to overcharge a wayfinder that's already been overcharged, the item is automatically destroyed (even if it has been repaired) and does not provide the activated benefit.

**Special**: You can apply multiple upgrades to a single wayfinder. Each upgrade only affects one wayfinder in your possession, chosen when the boon is purchased. If a wayfinder has multiple upgrades on it, you can only safely use each ability once per scenario.
