# S1-23 - Seasoned Diplomat
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** pfsboon; 




**\[Advanced\]****\[Limited Use\] â–¡**

* * *

**Effect** You have navigated the courts of Ekkeshikaar, honing your skills as a diplomat and researcher. You may check the box next to this boon at the beginning of an adventure to become trained in Diplomacy and Society for the duration of that adventure. If you are already trained in one of these skills, you instead become an expert. If your proficiency level is higher than expert in either of these skills, you treat any critical failure rolled with that skill as a failure and any failure as a success for the duration of the adventure.
