While working with less experienced Pathfinder allies, you provide important insights that keep your less experienced colleagues safe from harm. For any PCs benefiting from a Level Bump and whose levels are lower than yours, you increase the Level Bump's modifier to saving throws to 2.

**Normal** A Level Bump increases a PC's saving throw modifiers by 1.

**Special** A PC can only benefit from two mentor boons.
