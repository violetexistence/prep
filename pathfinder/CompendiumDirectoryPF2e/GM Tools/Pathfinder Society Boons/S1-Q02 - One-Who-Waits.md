# S1-Q02 - One-Who-Waits
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** pfsboon; 




**\[Slotless\]\[Limited Use\]** □□□

* * *

**Effect** Whenever you roll a critical failure on an Acrobatics or Athletics check, you can check a box next to this boon as a free action to get a failure instead (the GM can tell you if this wouldn't change the outcome of the check so you do not waste this ability).
