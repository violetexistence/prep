# Treasure Bundle Insurance
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** pfsboon; 



**Prerequisites** Admired by any Faction
* * *
**Cost**: 4 AcP

Even when your careful searching doesn't uncover all of a site's valuables, you're able to appraise, repair, and certify what you did recover to maximize their value. You can check a box that precedes this boon at the end of a scenario when you and your allies recovered 9 or fewer of the adventure's Treasure Bundles. Increase the effective number of Treasure Bundles recovered by 1 for the purpose of calculating the group's gold piece rewards.

The total number of additional Treasure Bundles provided by this boon cannot exceed the adventure's maximum (10, for a typical scenario).

**Special**: Multiple copies of this boon can be used during the same adventure, but only to recover up to a total of three lost Treasure Bundles.
