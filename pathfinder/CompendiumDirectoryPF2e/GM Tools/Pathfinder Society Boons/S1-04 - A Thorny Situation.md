# S1-04 - A Thorny Situation
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** pfsboon; 




**\[Generic\]**

* * *

**Effect** You were beaten by Vengeant Thorn's minions and left tied up in the woods. It's hard to say what will happen to the Immenwood with the renegade centaur in possession of such a powerful artifact, but maybe you'll have better luck thwarting the druid next time around. This boon might have special eff ects in future scenarios.
