# Adamant Wayfinder `pf2:r`
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** pfsboon; 



**Prerequisites** Liked by Vigilant Sea
* * *
**Cost**: 4 AcP

* * *

You have specially reinforced your [[Equipment/Wayfinder|Wayfinder]], devising a way for the device to absorb harmful energies. When you purchase this boon, you apply its benefits to one [[Equipment/Wayfinder|Wayfinder]] in your possession, granting you a special reaction ability when the [[Equipment/Wayfinder|Wayfinder]] is invested and in your possession. You gain the following reaction:

* * *

**Resist Harm** `pf2:r`

**Trigger** You would take damage.

* * *

**Effect** You gain resistance 1 to acid, cold, electricity, fire, force, negative, positive, and sonic damage against one attack, spell, or effect. This applies only to the initial effect, not to any subsequent attacks or damage dealt by the effect (such as persistent damage or an ongoing hazard). This resistance increases to 2 when you reach the Admired Reputation tier with Vigilant Seal, and to 4 when you reach the Revered Reputation Tier.

* * *

You can safely use this benefit once per adventure. You can attempt to use it a second time, overcharging the wayfinder at the risk of destroying it. When you do so, roll a `DC 10 Flat check`. On a success, the wayfinder is broken. On a failure, the wayfinder is destroyed. If anyone tries to overcharge a wayfinder that's already been overcharged, the item is automatically destroyed (even if it has been repaired) and does not provide the activated benefit.

Special: You can apply multiple upgrades to a single wayfinder. Each upgrade only affects one wayfinder in your possession, chosen when the boon is purchased. If a wayfinder has multiple upgrades on it, you can only safely use each ability once per scenario.

If the wayfinder with this upgrade is destroyed, you can apply the upgrade to another wayfinder during Downtime for no additional cost beyond that of the wayfinder itself.
