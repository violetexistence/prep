# Penitent Pathfinder
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** pfsboon; 




**Cost**: 20 AcP

Pathfinder Condition Removal (Slotless Boon): You have transgressed against the code that you hold dear, and you seek to make things right. A priest of your deity has agreed to assist you, and you may now undertake a quest of redemption. When you purchase this boon, you gain the benefits of a successful atone ritual.

Atone has an additional cost of 30 days of Downtime spent engaged in a task chosen by your deity. For the purpose of Pathfinder Society, the atonement is considered to be complete when the ritual is cast, but the character must still spend their subsequent 30 days of Downtime atoning and cannot use that time for any other purpose.
