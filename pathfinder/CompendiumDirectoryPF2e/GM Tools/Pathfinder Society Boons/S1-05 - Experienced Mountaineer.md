# S1-05 - Experienced Mountaineer
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** pfsboon; 




**\[Generic\]**

* * *

**Effect** The trek from Isger to Molthune taught you tricks for navigating treacherously steep terrain. While this boon is slotted, you treat mountainous terrain and other steep slopes as difficult terrain, rather than as greater difficult terrain.
