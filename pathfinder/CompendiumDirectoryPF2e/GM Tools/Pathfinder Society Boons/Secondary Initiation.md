## Feat 1
### 

**Category** pfsboon; 




**Cost**: 2 AcP

Your contacts have introduced you to an influential member of another organization, allowing you to join that group or train in some of their techniques. Select an organization other than the Pathfinder Society. For the purpose of fulfilling prerequisites and access conditions, you are treated as being a member of that group in addition to your belonging to the Pathfinder Society.

**Special**: You can purchase this boon multiple times, but each time you purchase it, you relinquish your membership in the previous group in order to join a different group. Before doing so, you must retrain any options that listed membership in your previous group as a prerequisite.
