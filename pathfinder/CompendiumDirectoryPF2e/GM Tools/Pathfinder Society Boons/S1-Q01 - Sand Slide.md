**Trigger** You would fail (but don't critically fail) a Reflex save to avoid a trap's effects.

* * *

**Effect** You [[Actions/Step|Step]] and then [[Actions/Drop Prone|Drop Prone]] in your new location. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your triggering Reflex save. If this would have been enough to resist the trap's effects initially, you succeed at the save instead.
