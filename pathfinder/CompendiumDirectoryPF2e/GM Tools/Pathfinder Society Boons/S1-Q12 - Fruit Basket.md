**Effect** As thanks for helping to uncover the source of the shipping disruptions, Selu has sent some fruit. Check this box when setting out on an adventure to receive a piece of specially treated baobab fruit. During that adventure, you or another character can use an Interact action to consume the fruit, which functions as a lesser elixir of life (restoring 3d6+6 Hit Points and providing a +1 bonus against diseases and poisons for 10 minutes). If you do not consume the fruit during that adventure, it spoils.
