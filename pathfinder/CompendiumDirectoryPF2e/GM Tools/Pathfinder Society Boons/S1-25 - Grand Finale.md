**Effect** You have survived the grim symphony, but the haunting melody which bridged the worlds of the living and the dead still echoes in your mind. When your dying value is 2 or greater, you can check the box next to this boon to gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Performance checks, 20 temporary Hit Points, and a +1 circumstance bonus to Fortitude saves, all for the next 10 minutes.
