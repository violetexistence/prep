## Feat 1

**Effect** In defeating a growing cult of Groetus in Cassomir, your spirit is filled with a renewed resistance against the same prophecies of doom that his priests shout from the rooftops. When your dying value is increased to exactly the amount that would kill you, this boon automatically activates. Check the box that precedes this boon and decrease your dying value by one.
