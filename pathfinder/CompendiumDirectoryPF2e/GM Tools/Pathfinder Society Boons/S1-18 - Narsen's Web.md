## Feat 1
### 

**Category** pfsboon;

**Effect** For good or ill, you have been swept up in the schemes of the masked priest Narsen. Whether the cunning cultist's aims are for good or ill remains to be seen. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to [[Actions/Sense Motive|Sense Motive]] when dealing with anyone hiding their features behind a mask or disguise (including magical disguises and polymorph effects that change the person's appearance to something unrecognizable).
