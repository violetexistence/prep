# S2-08 - Baba Yaga's Tutelage
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** pfsboon; 




After journeying into Irrisen, you attracted the attention of Baba Yaga, who has decided to teach you a lesson or two - either in thanks for your conduct or in the belief that only through her harsh tutelage will you learn some respect for the Land of Eternal Winter. Choose one of your characters to receive one of the following benefits; keep a copy of this boon with that character's records.

**Option 1** That character gains access to the rare Baba Yaga witch patron, as well as the character options that she grants: the [[Spells/Spirit Object|Spirit Object]] hex, lesson of the frozen queen major lesson, the [[Spells/Glacial Heart|Glacial Heart]] hex, and inanimate object familiars.

**Option 2** The character can also elect not to take Baba Yaga as a patron, in which case they still gain access to the lesson of the frozen queen major lesson and the [[Spells/Glacial Heart|Glacial Heart]] hex.

**Character chosen** -20_________
