**Effect** You are a champion of the Balgirdtrek, which earns you special privileges throughout the Lands of the Linnorm Kings. While playing in an adventure that takes place primarily in the Lands of the Linnorm Kings, you can stay for free at any Ulfen or Varki inn or similar establishment, and you gain a 10% on all non-magical goods bought in Ulfen or Varki settlements (this does not stack with any other discount or reduction in price). In addition, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus on all Diplomacy checks to [[Actions/Request|Make a Request]] while playing in an adventure that takes place primarily in the Lands of the Linnorm Kings.
