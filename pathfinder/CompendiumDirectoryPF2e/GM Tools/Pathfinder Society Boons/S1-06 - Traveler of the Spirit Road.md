# S1-06 - Traveler of the Spirit Road `pf2:0`
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** pfsboon;

**Effect** You have traveled the pathways near the Forest of Spirits and not only managed to avoid losing your way, but even befriended some of the local kami. The kami's blessing follows you now and protects you from bad luck. Whenever you would critically fail a check to [[Actions/Hide|Hide]], [[Actions/Sneak|Sneak]], [[Actions/Sense Direction|Sense Direction]], or [[Actions/Track|Track]] while in a forested area, you may check a box next to this boon as a free action to treat that check as a failure instead.
