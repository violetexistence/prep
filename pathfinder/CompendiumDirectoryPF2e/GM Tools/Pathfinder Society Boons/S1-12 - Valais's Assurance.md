**Effect** Valais Durant is the leader of the Radiant Oath, in no small part because of her kindness and willingness to share her power with those in need. You may check a box next to this boon and spend an action to use the champion focus spell [[Spells/Lay on Hands|Lay on Hands]], heightened appropriately for your level. This does not cost a focus point.
