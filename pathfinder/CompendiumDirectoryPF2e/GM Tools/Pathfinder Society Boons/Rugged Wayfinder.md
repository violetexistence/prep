# Rugged Wayfinder `pf2:1`
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** pfsboon; 



**Prerequisites** Liked by Horizon Hunters

**Cost**: 4 AcP

**Effect** You have modified your [[Equipment/Wayfinder|Wayfinder]] to absorb a small amount of your exhaustion, allowing you to continue exploring unhindered. When you purchase this boon, you apply its benefits to one wayfinder in your possession, granting you a special ability when the wayfinder is invested and in your possession.

As an action, you can reduce the severity of your [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy]], [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled]], or [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened]] condition, reducing that condition's value by 1.

You can safely use this benefit once per adventure. You can attempt to use it a second time, overcharging the wayfinder at the risk of destroying it. When you do so, roll a `DC 10 Flat check`. On a success, the wayfinder is broken. On a failure, the wayfinder is destroyed. If anyone tries to overcharge a wayfinder that's already been overcharged, the item is automatically destroyed (even if it has been repaired) and does not provide the activated benefit.

**Special**: You can apply multiple upgrades to a single wayfinder. Each upgrade only affects one wayfinder in your possession, chosen when the boon is purchased. If a wayfinder has multiple upgrades on it, you can only safely use each ability once per scenario.

If the wayfinder with this upgrade is destroyed, you can apply the upgrade to another wayfinder during Downtime for no additional cost beyond that of the wayfinder itself.
