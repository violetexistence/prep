**Effect** Thanks to your connection with Venture-Captain Muesello, you have an easier time securing [[Equipment/Wayfinder|Wayfinders]]. You can purchase wayfinders of up to your character level + 2 as long as you have access to them. If you own a [[Equipment/Wayfinder|Standard Wayfinder]], Muesello offers to upgrade it to a [[Equipment/Wayfinder|Wayfinder]] with additional features for the difference in cost between the items.
