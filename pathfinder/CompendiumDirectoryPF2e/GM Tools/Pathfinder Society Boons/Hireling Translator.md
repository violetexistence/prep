# Hireling Translator
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** pfsboon; 




**Cost**: 4 AcP

* * *

You have recruited a capable linguist who accompanies you on your adventures. This ally speaks, reads, and understands Common as well as two additional languages of common rarity chosen when this boon is purchased. The ally can quickly translate any of these languages for your benefit, effectively allowing you to communicate in the additional two languages without difficulty. However, you are not treated as knowing those languages for the purpose of using spells with the linguistic trait. The translator cannot be affected by or affect combat.

* * *

**Special**: You can apply this boon multiple times to the same character, but may only benefit from one hireling boon on any given adventure.
