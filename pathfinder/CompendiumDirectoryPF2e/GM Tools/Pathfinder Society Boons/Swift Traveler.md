**Effect** No matter how far afield you travel, it seems there's always a fellow explorer ready to help you return home in record time and enjoy a few extra days to recuperate. You can purchase this boon at the end of an adventure that granted at least 4 XP while the GM is filling out Chronicle sheets. When you do so, you gain an additional 4 days of Downtime.
