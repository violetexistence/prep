# Stench

### [[aura]][[olfactory]]

**Category** defensive; 




`Fortitude check`

* * *

A creature entering the aura or starting its turn in the area must succeed at a Fortitude save or become [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] (plus [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] as long as it's sickened on a critical failure). A creature that succeeds at its save or recovers from being sickened is temporarily immune to all stench auras for 1 minute.
