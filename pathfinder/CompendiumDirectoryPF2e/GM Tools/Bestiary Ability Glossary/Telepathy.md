# Telepathy

### [[aura]][[magical]][[mental]]

**Category** interaction; 




A monster with telepathy can communicate mentally with any creatures within the listed radius, as long as they share a language. This doesn't give any special access to their thoughts, and communicates no more information than normal speech would.
