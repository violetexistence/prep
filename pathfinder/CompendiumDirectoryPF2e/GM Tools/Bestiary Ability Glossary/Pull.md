# Pull `pf2:1`

### 

**Category** offensive; 




**Requirements** The monster's last action was a success with a Strike that lists Pull in its damage entry

* * *

**Effect** The monster attempts to [[Actions/Reposition|Reposition]] the creature, moving it closer to the monster. This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the monster's multiple attack penalty. If Pull lists a distance, change the distance the creature is pulled on a success to that distance.
