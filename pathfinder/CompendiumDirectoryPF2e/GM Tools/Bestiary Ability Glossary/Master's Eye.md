# Master's Eye `pf2:3`

### [[concentrate]][[divine]][[scrying]]

**Category** offensive; 




The master observes the world through the raktavarna's eyes instead of their own, using the raktavarna's Perception and darkvision. This lasts until the end of the master's next turn, but the master can Sustain the activity.

This ability functions at any range, even on different planes of existence. If the raktavarna dies while their master is using this ability, the master is [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 5]].
