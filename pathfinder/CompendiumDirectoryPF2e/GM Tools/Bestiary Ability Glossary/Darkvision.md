# Darkvision

### 

**Category** interaction; 




A monster with darkvision can see perfectly well in areas of darkness and dim light, though such vision is in black and white only. Some forms of magical darkness, such as a 4th-rank [[Spells/Darkness|Darkness]] spell, block normal darkvision. A monster with [[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Greater Darkvision|Greater Darkvision]], however, can see through even these forms of magical darkness.
