# Change Formation `pf2:2`

### [[concentrate]][[move]]

**Category** interaction; 




The troop reconfigures to assume one of the formations below they know. Using this action again ends any previous formation, and the troop can also use this action to revert to its default formation, ending any benefits and drawbacks.

*   **Loose** Members of the troop fan out to cover more ground. **Benefit** Any weaknesses the troop has to area and splash damage are suppressed. **Drawback** Enemies' saving throws against the troop's damaging effects are one degree of success better than they roll.
*   **Marching Column** This formation traverses long distances more rapidly. **Benefit** The troop gains a +10 foot circumstance bonus to all its Speeds. **Drawback** The troop is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] and takes a –2 penalty to Reflex saves.
*   **Turtle Shell** The troop interlocks their shields. Only a group with shields can use this formation. **Benefit** The troop gains a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against ranged attacks and to Reflex saves. **Drawback** The troop takes a –10-foot penalty to all its Speeds.
*   **Wedge** The troop aligns itself behind a powerful commander. **Benefit** The troop chooses an adjacent allied creature without the troop trait to fall in behind. Each time the chosen creature Strides, the troop follows as a free action, Striding to keep the chosen creature adjacent. **Drawback** The troop loses some of their autonomy. They're slowed 1 and can't voluntarily move away from their leader.
