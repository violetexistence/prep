# Buck `pf2:r`

### 

**Category** defensive; 




`Reflex check`

* * *

Most monsters that serve as mounts can attempt to buck off unwanted or annoying riders, but most mounts will not use this reaction against a trusted creature unless the mounts are spooked or mistreated.

**Trigger** A creature [[Actions/Mount|Mounts]] or uses the [[Actions/Command an Animal|Command an Animal]] action while riding the monster.

* * *

**Effect** The triggering creature must succeed at a Reflex saving throw against the listed DC or fall off the creature and land [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]. If the save is a critical failure, the triggering creature also takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage in addition to the normal damage for the fall.
