The monster deals the listed amount of damage to any number of creatures [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]] by it. Each of those creatures can attempt a basic Fortitude save with the listed DC. A creature that fails this save falls [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]], and a creature that succeeds is then temporarily immune to falling unconscious from Greater Constrict for 1 minute.
