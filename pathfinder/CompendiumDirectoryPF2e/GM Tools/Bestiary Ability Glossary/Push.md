# Push `pf2:1`

### 

**Category** offensive; 




**Requirements** The monster's last action was a successful Strike that lists Push in its damage entry

**Effect** The monster attempts to [[Actions/Shove|Shove]] the creature. This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the monster's multiple attack penalty. If Push lists a distance, change the distance the creature is pushed on a success to that distance.
