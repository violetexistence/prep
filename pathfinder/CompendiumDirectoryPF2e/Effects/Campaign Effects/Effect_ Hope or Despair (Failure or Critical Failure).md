# Effect: Hope or Despair (Failure or Critical Failure)
## Level 1
### 






**Failure** Feelings of sadness and despair well up in the creature's mind. For the next hour, the creature takes a -1 penalty to all saving throws against mental effects; this penalty increases to a -2 penalty against emotion mental effects. This effect has the curse trait.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the effects persist as long as the green hag Tulvak remains in control of the shrine.
