# Effect: Spirit Power (Passion)
## Level 1
### 






Your body is engulfed in fire of a color of your choice that sheds bright light in a 40-foot radius (and dim light to the next 40 feet). Your melee Strikes inflict an additional 1d6 points of fire damage, you gain resistance 10 to fire, and you gain the [[Adventure-Specific Actions/Reactive Scorch|Reactive Scorch]] reaction.
