# Malevolence

### 






As the malevolence begins to take its hold on creatures, their body, minds, and souls become increasingly haunted by the supernatural force infesting Xarwin Manor. Malevolence is a special condition that can affect PCs who play in this adventure. The malevolence condition always includes a value. You take a status penalty equal to this value to all saving throws against effects generated by haunts and against all curse and possession effects. The malevolence condition can be reduced by restoration.

The malevolence can never increase above a value of 4. If an effect would increase a creature's malevolence value higher than 4, the creature is instead [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] for 24 hours as the malevolence consumes a few of their random, short-term memories. A creature that has a malevolence 4 won't voluntarily leave the Xarwin Manor grounds.

Each time you get a full night's rest in a region not influenced by the malevolence condition, the value of your malevolence decreases by 1.
