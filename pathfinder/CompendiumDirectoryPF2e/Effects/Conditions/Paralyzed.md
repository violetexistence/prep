# Paralyzed

### 






You're frozen in place. You have the [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] condition and can't act except to [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] and use actions that require only your mind (as determined by the GM). Your senses still function, but only in the areas you can perceive without moving, so you can't [[Actions/Seek|Seek]].
