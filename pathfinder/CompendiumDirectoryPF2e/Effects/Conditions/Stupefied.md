# Stupefied

### 

**Group** abilities




Your thoughts and instincts are clouded. Stupefied always includes a value. You take a status penalty equal to this value on Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and Charisma-based rolls and DCs, including Will saving throws, spell attack modifiers, spell DCs, and skill checks that use these attribute modifiers. Any time you attempt to [[Actions/Cast a Spell|Cast a Spell]] while stupefied, the spell is disrupted unless you succeed at a `Flat check` with a DC equal to 5 + your stupefied value.
