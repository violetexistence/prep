# Cursebound

### 

**Group** abilities




Your oracular curse is constricting around you as you receive divine punishment after drawing too deeply on your mystery's powers. Cursebound is a condition that affects only creatures with an oracular curse, and cursebound always includes a value. Your specific oracular curse imposes unique negative effects depending on your cursebound value. You can remove the cursebound condition only by Refocusing.
