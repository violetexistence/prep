# Unconscious

### 

**Group** death




You're sleeping or have been knocked out. You can't act. You take a â€“4 status penalty to AC, Perception, and Reflex saves, and you have the [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] and [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] conditions. When you gain this condition, you fall [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] and drop items you're holding unless the effect states otherwise or the GM determines you're positioned so you wouldn't.

If you're unconscious because you're [[Conditions/Dying|Dying]], you can't wake up while you have 0 Hit Points. If you are restored to 1 Hit Point or more, you lose the dying and unconscious conditions and can act normally on your next turn.

If you are unconscious and at 0 Hit Points, but not dying, you return to 1 Hit Point and awaken after sufficient time passes. The GM determines how long you remain unconscious, from a minimum of 10 minutes to several hours. If you are healed, you lose the unconscious condition and can act normally on your next turn.

If you're unconscious and have more than 1 Hit Point (typically because you are asleep or unconscious due to an effect), you wake up in one of the following ways.

*   You take damage, though if the damage reduces you to 0 Hit Points, you remain unconscious and gain the dying condition as normal.
*   You receive healing, other than the natural healing you get from resting.
*   Someone shakes you awake with an [[Actions/Interact|Interact]] action.
*   Loud noise around you might wake you. At the start of your turn, you automatically attempt a Perception check against the noise's DC (or the lowest DC if there is more than one noise), waking up if you succeed. If creatures are attempting to stay quiet around you, this Perception check uses their Stealth DCs. Some effects make you sleep so deeply that they don't allow you this Perception check.
*   If you are simply asleep, the GM decides you wake up either because you have had a restful night's sleep or something disrupted that rest.
