# Hostile

### 

**Group** attitudes




This condition reflects a creature's disposition toward a particular character, and only supernatural effects (like a spell) can impose on a PC. A creature hostile to a character actively seeks to harm that character. It doesn't necessarily attack, but it won't accept [[Actions/Request|Requests]] from the character.
