# Invisible

### 

**Group** senses




You can't be seen. You're [[Conditions/Undetected|Undetected]] to everyone. Creatures can [[Actions/Seek|Seek]] to detect you; if a creature succeeds at its Perception check against your Stealth DC, you become [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] to that creature until you [[Actions/Sneak|Sneak]] to become undetected again. If you become invisible while someone can already see you, you start out hidden to them (instead of undetected) until you successfully Sneak. You can't become [[Conditions/Observed|Observed]] while invisible except via special abilities or magic.
