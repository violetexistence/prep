# Hidden

### 

**Group** detection




While you're hidden from a creature, that creature knows the space you're in but can't tell precisely where you are. You typically become hidden by using Stealth to [[Actions/Hide|Hide]]. When [[Actions/Seek|Seeking]] a creature using only imprecise senses, it remains hidden, rather than [[Conditions/Observed|Observed]]. A creature you're hidden from is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] to you, and it must succeed at a `DC 11 Flat check` when targeting you with an attack, spell, or other effect or it fails to affect you. Area effects aren't subject to this flat check.

A creature might be able to use the seek action to try to observe you.
