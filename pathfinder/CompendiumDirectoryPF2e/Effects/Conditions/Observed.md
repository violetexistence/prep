# Observed

### 

**Group** detection




Anything in plain view is observed by you. If a creature takes measures to avoid detection, such as by using Stealth to [[Actions/Hide|Hide]], it can become [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] or [[Conditions/Undetected|Undetected]] instead of observed. If you have another precise sense besides sight, you might be able to observe a creature or object using that sense instead. You can observe a creature with only your precise senses. When [[Actions/Seek|Seeking]] a creature using only imprecise senses, it remains hidden, rather than observed.
