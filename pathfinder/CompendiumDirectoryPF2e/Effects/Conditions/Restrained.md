# Restrained

### 






You're tied up and can barely move, or a creature has you pinned. You have the [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] and [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] conditions, and you can't use any attack or manipulate actions except to attempt to [[Actions/Escape|Escape]] or [[Actions/Force Open|Force Open]] your bonds. Restrained overrides [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]].
