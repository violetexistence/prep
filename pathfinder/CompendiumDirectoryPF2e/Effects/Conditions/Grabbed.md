# Grabbed

### 






You're held in place by another creature, giving you the [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] and [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] conditions. If you attempt a manipulate action while grabbed, you must succeed at a `DC 5 Flat check` or it is lost; roll the check after spending the action, but before any effects are applied.
