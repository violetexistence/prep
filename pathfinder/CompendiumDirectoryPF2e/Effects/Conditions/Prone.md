# Prone

### 






You're lying on the ground. You are [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] and take a â€“2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls. The only move actions you can use while you're prone are [[Actions/Crawl|Crawl]] and [[Actions/Stand|Stand]]. Standing up ends the prone condition. You can [[Actions/Take Cover|Take Cover]] while prone to hunker down and gain greater cover against ranged attacks, even if you don't have an object to get behind, which grants you a +4 circumstance bonus to AC against ranged attacks (but you remain off-guard).

If you would be knocked prone while you're [[Actions/Climb|Climbing]] or [[Actions/Fly|Flying]], you fall. You can't be knocked prone when [[Actions/Swim|Swimming]].
