# Effect: Sight Prey
## Level 10
### 






The warmonger's ranged Strikes against the marked creature gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the attack roll and deal an extra 3d6 precision damage. Each time the warmonger hits that creature with a ranged Strike, the creature takes a â€“10-foot penalty to its Speeds for 1 minute and falls 20 feet if it's flying.
