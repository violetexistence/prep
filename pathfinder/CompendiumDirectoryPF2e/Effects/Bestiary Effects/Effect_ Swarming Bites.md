# Effect: Swarming Bites
## Level 5
### 






A creature that fails its save against Swarming Bites becomes [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] for 1 round. If the creature attempts a concentrate or manipulate action while affected, it must succeed at a `DC 5 Flat check` or the action is lost; roll the check after spending the action, but before any effects are applied.
