# Effect: Fold Form
## Level 1
### 






The kinzaruk swiftly unfolds and refolds its body into a new shape chosen from the options of animal form. This grants it the movement Speeds and Strikes of the chosen form, but none of the other benefits. Its attack bonus is unchanged, and its damage bonus is +3.
