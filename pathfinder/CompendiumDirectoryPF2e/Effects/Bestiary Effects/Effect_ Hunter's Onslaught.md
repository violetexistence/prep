# Effect: Hunter's Onslaught
## Level 6
### 






You become fascinated by the marked creature and you gain 10 temporary Hit Points that last as long as the onslaught does. You gain a +8 status bonus to damage rolls against the marked enemy, and allies in a 30-foot aura around the hunter gain half that bonus.
