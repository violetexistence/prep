# Effect: Transfer Protection
## Level 1
### 






A creature can wear a willing cassisian as a helmet. While it does, the cassisian can't act, but the cassisian extends their +1 status bonus to AC and saves against unholy creatures to their wearer. At any time, the cassisian can detach themself from their wearer as a single action.
