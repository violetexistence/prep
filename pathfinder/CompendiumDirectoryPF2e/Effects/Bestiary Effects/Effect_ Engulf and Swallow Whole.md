# Effect: Engulf and Swallow Whole
## Level 1
### 






Granted by [[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Engulf|Engulf]] or [[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Swallow Whole|Swallow Whole]]

You are grabbed, slowed 1, and you have to hold your breath or start suffocating. You can only attack the origin with unarmed attacks or with weapons of light Bulk or less, and the origin is off-guard against the attack. If the origin takes piercing or slashing damage equaling or exceeding the listed Rupture value from a single attack or spell, you cut yourself free.
