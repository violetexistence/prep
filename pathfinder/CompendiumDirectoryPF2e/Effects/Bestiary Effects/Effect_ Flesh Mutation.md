# Effect: Flesh Mutation
## Level 7
### 






You are affected by an effect according to the result.

**1 Spongy Flesh** The creature has weakness 5 to physical damage.

**2 Caustic Blood** The creature takes 2d4 persistent acid damage that can't be removed normally, but ends when the mutation does.

**3 Sprouting Eyes** The creature is [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]], but also immune to flanking.

**4 Mutated Mind** The creature is [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]]. It can still recover as noted in the condition, but if it does it remains [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the mutation ends.
