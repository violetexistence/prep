# Effect: Remaining Air
## Level 1
### 






See [[PF2e Journals/GM Screen/Drowning and Suffocating|Drowning and Suffocating]]

You can hold your breath for a number of rounds equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier. Reduce your remaining air by 1 round at the end of each of your turns, or by 2 if you attacked or cast any spells that turn.

You also lose 1 round worth of air each time you are critically hit or critically fail a save against a damaging effect. If you speak (including Casting a Spell) you lose all remaining air.
