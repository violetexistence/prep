# Effect: Change Shape (Werecreature)
## Level 1
### 






Granted by [[Actions/Change Shape|Change Shape]]

You transform into your hybrid or animal shape. Your equipment transforms with you and continues to provide bonuses, but your animal shape cannot use weapons, shields, or other held items and cannot use manipulate actions. You gain a movement speed, unarmed attacks, and potentially other abilities based on your werecreature type. These unarmed attacks are in the brawling group. You can Dismiss the effect to return to your humanoid shape, and you resume your humanoid shape automatically if you're reduced to 0 Hit Points.
