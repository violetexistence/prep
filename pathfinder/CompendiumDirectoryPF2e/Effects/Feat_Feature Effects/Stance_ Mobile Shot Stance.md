# Stance: Mobile Shot Stance
## Level 1
### 






Granted by [[Feats/Mobile Shot Stance|Mobile Shot Stance]]

Your ranged Strikes don't trigger Attacks of Opportunity or other reactions that are triggered by a ranged attack.

If you have [[Actions/Reactive Strike|Reactive Strike]], you can use it with a loaded ranged weapon you're wielding. The triggering creature must be within 5 feet of you for you to do so.
