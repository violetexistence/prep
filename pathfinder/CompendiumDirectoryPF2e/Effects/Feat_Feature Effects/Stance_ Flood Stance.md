# Stance: Flood Stance
## Level 1
### 






Granted by [[Feats/Flood Stance|Flood Stance]]

The only Strikes you can make are flooded river unarmed attacks. These deal 1d8 bludgeoning damage; are in the brawling group; have the nonlethal, trip, unarmed, and water traits; and don't take the normal penalty for being used underwater. They also gain the forceful trait while you're underwater.
