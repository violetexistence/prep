# Effect: Weapon Infusion
## Level 1
### 






Granted by [[Feats/Weapon Infusion|Weapon Infusion]].

If your next action is an Elemental Blast, choose a weapon shape for it to take. You can choose to change the blast's damage type to bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing-whichever suits the weapon shape-and you can choose other alterations depending on whether you make a melee or ranged blast.

*   **Melee** Add one of the following traits of your choice: agile, backswing, forceful, reach, sweep.
*   **Ranged** Choose one of three options: range increment 100 feet and the volley 30 feet trait, range increment 50 feet and the propulsive trait, or range increment 20 feet and the thrown trait.
