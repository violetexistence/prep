# Stance: Gorilla Stance

### 






Granted by [[Feats/Gorilla Stance|Gorilla Stance]]

The only Strikes you can make are gorilla slam unarmed attacks. These deal 1d8 bludgeoning damage; are in the brawling group; and have the backswing, forceful, grapple, nonlethal, and unarmed traits.

You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks to Climb, and if you roll a success on an Athletics check to Climb, you get a critical success instead.
