# Stance: Gorilla Stance (Gorilla Pound)

### 






Granted by [[Feats/Gorilla Stance|Gorilla Stance]] if you have [[Feats/Gorilla Pound|Gorilla Pound]], which grants you a climb speed of 15 while you are in this stance.

The only Strikes you can make are gorilla slam unarmed attacks. These deal 1d8 bludgeoning damage; are in the brawling group; and have the backswing, forceful, grapple, nonlethal, and unarmed traits.

You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks to Climb, and if you roll a success on an Athletics check to Climb, you get a critical success instead.
