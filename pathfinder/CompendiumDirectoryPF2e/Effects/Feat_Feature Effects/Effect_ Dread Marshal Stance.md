# Effect: Dread Marshal Stance
## Level 1
### 






Granted by [[Feats/Dread Marshal Stance|Dread Marshal Stance]]

You gain a +1 status bonus to damage rolls. When the marshal or an ally in the aura critically hit an enemy with a Strike, that enemy is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]]. If the marshal is wielding a weapon that has more than one damage die (typically due to a striking rune), you can have the status bonus equal the weapon's number of damage dice instead of +1.
