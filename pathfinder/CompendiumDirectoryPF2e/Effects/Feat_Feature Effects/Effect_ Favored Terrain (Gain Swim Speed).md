# Effect: Favored Terrain (Gain Swim Speed)
## Level 11
### 






Granted by [[Feats/Favored Terrain|Favored Terrain (Aquatic)]] if you have the [[Class Features/Unimpeded Journey|Wild Stride]] class feature, and are in aquatic terrain and do not already have a swim Speed.

You gain a swim Speed equal to your Speed.
