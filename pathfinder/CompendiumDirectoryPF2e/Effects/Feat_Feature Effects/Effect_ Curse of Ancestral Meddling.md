# Effect: Curse of Ancestral Meddling
## Level 1
### 






Granted by [[Class Features/Ancestors|Ancestors]]

### Curse of Ancestral Meddling

The ancestral spirits you commune with haunt you and meddle with your belongings and actions, either out of a well-intentioned (but ultimately detrimental) attempt to assist you, as punishment for your audacity in circumventing the traditional means of achieving divine power, for their own amusement, or a mixture of the above. Your hair, clothing, and belongings constantly shift and stir, seemingly of their own volition.

**Minor Curse**

One of your ancestors becomes predominant in their meddling. The first time you gain this effect each day, roll 1d4 on the list below to determine which type of ancestor becomes predominant. This predominant ancestor guides you to use their preferred type of action. When you try to use one of the types of actions listed for the other ancestors, you must succeed at a `DC 4 Flat check`. On a failure, you spend the action but gain no effect (though you don't lose the spell if you were Casting a Spell). If your action would take 1 minute or longer, it's long enough that you can overcome the meddling, and you don't need to attempt a flat check.

During combat or another tense, round-by-round encounter, other ancestors wrestle for control of your actions. When you roll initiative, and then at the end of each of your turns during the encounter, roll 1d4 and change your predominant ancestor appropriately. Once the encounter ends, you return to the influence of the ancestor you first rolled for the day.

**Moderate Curse**

The flat check DC to use other actions is 6, and you get the moderate curse benefit listed for your predominant ancestor in the list below.

**Major Curse (11th)**

The flat check DC is 8, and you get the major curse benefit listed for your predominant ancestor instead of the moderate curse benefit.
