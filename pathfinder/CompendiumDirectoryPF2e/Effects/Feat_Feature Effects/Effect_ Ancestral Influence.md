# Effect: Ancestral Influence
## Level 1
### 






One of your ancestors becomes predominant in their meddling. The first time you gain this effect each day, roll 1d4 on the list below to determine which type of ancestor becomes predominant. During combat or another tense, round-by-round encounter, other ancestors wrestle for control of your actions. When you roll initiative, and then at the end of each of your turns during the encounter, roll 1d4 and change your predominant ancestor appropriately. Once the encounter ends, you return to the influence of the ancestor you first rolled for the day.
