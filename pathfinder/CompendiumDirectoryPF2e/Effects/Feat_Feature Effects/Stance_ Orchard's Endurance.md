# Stance: Orchard's Endurance
## Level 1
### 






You and your allies in your kinetic aura gain resistance 5 to bludgeoning and piercing damage. In addition, you and your affected allies roll flat checks to recover from persistent damage twice and take the higher result; this is a fortune effect.

**Level (+4)** The resistance increases by 2.
