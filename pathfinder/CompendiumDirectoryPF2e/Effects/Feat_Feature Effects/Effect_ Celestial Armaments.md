Your weapon sheds light like a torch, deals an additional 1d8 spirit damage, and you gain the weapon's critical specialization.

When you critically hit a target with the weapon, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC or spell DC (whichever is higher) or be blinded for 1d4 rounds.
