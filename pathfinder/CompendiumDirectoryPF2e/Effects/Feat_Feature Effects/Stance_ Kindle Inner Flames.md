# Stance: Kindle Inner Flames
## Level 1
### 






Granted by [[Feats/Kindle Inner Flames|Kindle Inner Flames]]

You shed faint, glowing embers, as do your allies while they're in your kinetic aura. Anyone shedding these embers gains a +1 status bonus to Reflex saves and Acrobatics checks and can Step as a free action once per round. When an affected creature takes a move action, its Strikes deal an extra 2 fire damage until the end of its turn.

* * *

**Level (12th)** The status bonus to Reflex saves and Acrobatics checks is +2, and the Strikes gain the _[[Equipment/Flaming|Flaming]]_ rune instead of the extra 2 fire damage.
