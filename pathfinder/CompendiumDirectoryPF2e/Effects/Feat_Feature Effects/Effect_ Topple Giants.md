# Effect: Topple Giants
## Level 8
### 






Granted by [[Feats/Topple Giants|Topple Giants]]

When an ally within your overwatch field attempts to [[Actions/Disarm|Disarm]], [[Actions/Shove|Shove]], or [[Actions/Trip|Trip]] an opponent within your overwatch field and fails, you coordinate efforts to provide a +2 circumstance bonus to the next Athletics check rolled by a different ally to attempt the same action on the same target before that target's next turn.
