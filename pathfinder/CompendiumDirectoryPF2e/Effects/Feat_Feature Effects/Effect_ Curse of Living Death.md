# Effect: Curse of Living Death
## Level 1
### 






Granted by [[Class Features/Bones|Bones]]

### Curse of Living Death

Your body is slowly decaying even though you are alive, and using your powers furthers this unnatural living death. You carry a touch of the grave about you, manifesting as bloodless pallor, a faint smell of earth, or deathly cold skin.

#### Minor Curse

Bones protrude through your skin and your flesh rots, combining with a stench of decay and an unearthly chill. Non-magical effects that would restore your Hit Points only grant you half as many HP as normal.

#### Moderate Curse

Your dead flesh continues to rot, affecting your health. You become [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]], and this drained condition is cumulative with any other drained conditions you gain. This drained condition is removed only when you Refocus; effects that normally remove the drained condition reduce your drained condition to drained 1 instead.

In addition, you gain resistance to poison equal to half your level. You gain a +4 status bonus to saves against diseases, poisons, and death effects, and if you roll a success on such a save, you get a critical success instead.

#### Major Curse (11th)

You stand just steps from the grave. You become [[Conditions/Wounded|Wounded 1]]. This wounded condition is removed only when you Refocus; effects that normally remove the wounded condition reduce your wounded condition to wounded 1 instead.

When you would attempt a recovery check, you can choose to get an automatic success instead of rolling, and if you roll a critical failure on a save against a disease, poison, or death effect, you get a failure instead.
