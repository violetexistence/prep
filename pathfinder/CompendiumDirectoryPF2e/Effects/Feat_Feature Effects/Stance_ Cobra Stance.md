# Stance: Cobra Stance

### 






Granted by [[Feats/Cobra Stance|Cobra Stance]]

The only Strikes you can make are cobra fang unarmed attacks. These deal 1d4 piercing damage; are in the brawling group; and have the agile, deadly d10, finesse, unarmed, and venomous traits.

You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Fortitude saves and your Fortitude DC, and you gain poison resistance equal to half your level.
