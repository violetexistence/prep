# Effect: Unstable Check Failure
## Level 1
### 






Granted by [[Class Features/Innovation|Innovation]] failing an Unstable check

The innovation malfunctions in a spectacular (though harmless) fashion, such as a belch of smoke or shower of sparks, and it becomes incapable of being used for further unstable actions.
