# Effect: Energetic Meltdown
## Level 1
### 






Granted by [[Class Features/Energetic Meltdown|Energetic Meltdown]]

**Mild Backlash** You take damage equal to your level as energy scours your body.

**Moderate Backlash** After taking the damage, you gain weakness to the energy type of your backlash until your next daily preparations. The weakness is equal to one-third of your level. You also lose immunity to the energy type if you had it, until your next daily preparations.

**Severe Backlash** You deal 1d6 damage per level to all creatures in a 30-foot emanation with a `Fortitude check` save. You automatically take full damage without attempting a save.
