# Effect: Smite
## Level 6
### 






Granted by [[Feats/Smite|Smite]].

Designate one enemy you can see. Until the start of your next turn, your Strikes against that enemy gain a +3 status bonus to damage, increasing to +4 if you have master proficiency with the weapon or unarmed attack you're using for the Strike. If you're holy or unholy and the target has the opposite trait, the bonus is +4 (or +6 if you're a master).
