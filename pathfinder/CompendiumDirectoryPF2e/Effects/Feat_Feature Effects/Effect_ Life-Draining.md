# Effect: Life-Draining
## Level 1
### 






Granted by [[Class Features/Life-Draining|Life-Draining]]

**Mild Backlash** You become [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]] as the plants feed off your life force. This condition lasts until you spend 3 consecutive actions to rest and do nothing.

**Moderate Backlash** You become [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 2]] and [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]] until you spend 20 minutes recuperating by resting and doing nothing. If you spend this time basking in sunshine, it instead takes 10 minutes.

**Severe Backlash** You become [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 3]] until you spend 2 hours napping. While napping, you're [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]] and can't take actions or engage in exploration activities, but a creature can wake you with a single action with the manipulate trait. If you spend this time napping in natural sunlight, it instead takes 1 hour. You're fatigued until you can get a full night's rest.
