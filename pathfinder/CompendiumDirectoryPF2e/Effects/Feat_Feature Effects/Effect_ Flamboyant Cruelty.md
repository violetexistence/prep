Granted when you use [[Feats/Flamboyant Cruelty|Flamboyant Cruelty]]

When you make a melee weapon Strike against a foe that has at least two of the following conditions - Clumsy, Drained, Enfeebled, Frightened, Sickened, and Stupefied - you gain a circumstance bonus to your damage roll equal to the number of these conditions the foe has.

If you hit such a foe, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to skill checks to Tumble Through and to perform your style's Panache-granting actions until the end of your turn.
