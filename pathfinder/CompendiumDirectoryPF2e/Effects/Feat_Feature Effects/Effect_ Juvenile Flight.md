# Effect: Juvenile Flight
## Level 9
### 






You gain a fly Speed equal to your land Speed while your wings are unfurled.

If you have [[Feats/Fledgling Flight|Fledgling Flight]], you gain a +10-foot status bonus to your fly Speed with Juvenile Flight. As normal, since your fly Speed is derived from your land Speed, this status bonus isn't cumulative with a status bonus to your land Speed, if you have one.
