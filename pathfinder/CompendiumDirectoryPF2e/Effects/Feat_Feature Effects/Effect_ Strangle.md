# Effect: Strangle
## Level 8
### 






Granted by [[Feats/Strangle|Strangle]]

You must succeed at a DC 10 flat check or lose any action that requires speech. For an action requiring speech that is also a manipulate action, like Casting a Spell with the concentrate and manipulate trait, you just roll a single DC 10 flat check, rather than an additional DC 5 flat check for being grabbed.
