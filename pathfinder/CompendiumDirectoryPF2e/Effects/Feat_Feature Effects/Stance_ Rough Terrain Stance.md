# Stance: Rough Terrain Stance
## Level 1
### 






Granted by [[Feats/Rough Terrain Stance|Rough Terrain Stance]]

Each square adjacent to you becomes difficult terrain that matches the terrain attunement you gained (rime forms in an arctic terrain, momentary undergrowth shoots up in a forest terrain, and so on). You ignore this difficult terrain.
