# Effect: Perfect Protection
## Level 18
### 






Granted by [[Feats/Perfect Protection|Perfect Protection]]

When you critically hit the origin, they roll a DC 14 flat check. On a success, it becomes a normal hit. If the origin's armor has a fortification rune, they roll only one flat check, but the DC is 12 (or 10 if it's a greater fortification rune).
