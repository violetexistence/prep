# Effect: Sword Practice
## Level 1
### 






Granted by [[Feats/Tengu Weapon Familiarity|Tengu Weapon Familiarity]]

During your daily preparations, you can practice with a weapon from the sword group that's in your possession. You gain familiarity with that weapon as well. This lasts until you practice with a different sword in the same way.
