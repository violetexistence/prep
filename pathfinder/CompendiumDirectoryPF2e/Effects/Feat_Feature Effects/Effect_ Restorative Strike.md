# Effect: Restorative Strike
## Level 4
### 






Granted by [[Feats/Restorative Strike|Restorative Strike]]

Cast a 1-action [[Spells/Harm|Harm]] or [[Spells/Heal|Heal]] spell to heal yourself, expending the spell normally. It loses the manipulate trait when cast this way. Then make a melee Strike. If you make this Strike with your deity's favored weapon, you gain a +1 status bonus to the attack roll.

If the Strike hits, you can target a second willing creature to heal the same amount from the spell. This creature can be outside of the spell's range, provided it's adjacent to the enemy you hit.
