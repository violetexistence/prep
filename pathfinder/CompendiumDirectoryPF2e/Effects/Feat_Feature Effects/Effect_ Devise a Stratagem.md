# Effect: Devise a Stratagem
## Level 1
### 






Granted by [[Actions/Devise a Stratagem|Devise a Stratagem]]

Choose a creature you can see, and roll a d20. If you Strike the chosen creature, you use the result of the roll you made to Devise a Stratagem for your Strike's attack roll instead of rolling.

When you make this substitution, you can also add your Intelligence modifier to your attack roll instead of your Strength or Dexterity modifier, provided your Strike uses an agile or finesse melee weapon, an agile or finesse unarmed attack, a ranged weapon (which must be agile or finesse if it's a melee weapon with the thrown trait) or sap.
