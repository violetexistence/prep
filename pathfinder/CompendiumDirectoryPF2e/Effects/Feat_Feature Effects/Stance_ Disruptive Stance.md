# Stance: Disruptive Stance
## Level 1
### 






Granted by [[Feats/Disruptive Stance|Disruptive Stance]]

You can use Reactive Strike when a creature within your reach uses a concentrate action, in addition to manipulate and move actions.

Furthermore, you disrupt a triggering concentrate or manipulate action if your Strike hits (not only if it's a critical hit).
