# Stance: Sea Glass Guardians
## Level 1
### 






Granted by [[Feats/Sea Glass Guardians|Sea Glass Guardians]]

You and your allies within your kinetic aura gain a +1 status bonus to AC and saving throws.

If any creature affected is critically hit or critically fails at a saving throw against an attack, effect from an enemy, or hazard and remains above 0 HP, the guardians reach out to heal that creature. The creature regains 4d8+8 HP, and the impulse ends. If the creature is in water, the healing dice are d10s instead of d8s.

**Level (+3)** The healing increases by 1d8+4.

Leveled HP
