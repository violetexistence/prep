# Effect: Offensive Boost
## Level 1
### 






Granted by [[Class Features/Offensive Boost|Offensive Boost]]

Your improvements make any Strikes that rely on your innovation deal an additional 1d6 damage, with a type determined by the boost you choose. If your innovation is armor, the boost applies to your melee Strikes with one weapon you choose during daily preparations; if your innovation is a construct, the boost applies to your construct companion's Strikes.
