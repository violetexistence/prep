# Effect: Heaven's Thunder
## Level 6
### 






Granted by [[Feats/Heaven's Thunder|Heaven's Thunder]]

Your unarmed attacks and any monk weapons you wield deal additional electricity and sonic damage; the amount of each damage type is equal to the number of damage dice for the weapon or unarmed attack.

If you also know the _qi blast_ qi spell, you can choose to deal either electricity or sonic damage with the spell instead of force (_qi blast_ loses the force trait and gains the electricity or sonic trait instead).
