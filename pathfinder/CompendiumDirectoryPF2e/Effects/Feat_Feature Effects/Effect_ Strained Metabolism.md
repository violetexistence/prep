## Level 1
### 






Granted by [[Class Features/Strained Metabolism|Strained Metabolism]]

**Mild Backlash** You become [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]] and [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] until you take a bite of food (which usually requires 2 Interact actions: one to retrieve the food and another to consume it).

**Moderate Backlash** You are enfeebled 1, clumsy 1, and [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]] until you can eat a full meal, which requires at least 10 minutes.

**Severe Backlash** You become [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]] as nausea wracks you, and you are also enfeebled 1 and clumsy 1 until you can eat a full meal (which requires you to no longer be sickened). You are fatigued until you can get a full night's rest.
