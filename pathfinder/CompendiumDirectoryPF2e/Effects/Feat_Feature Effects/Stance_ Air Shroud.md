# Stance: Air Shroud
## Level 1
### 






Granted by [[Feats/Air Shroud|Air Shroud]]

Attacks with ranged weapons take a -1 circumstance penalty to their attack rolls if their paths pass through your kinetic aura. Air in your kinetic aura is difficult terrain for flying creatures other than yourself.
