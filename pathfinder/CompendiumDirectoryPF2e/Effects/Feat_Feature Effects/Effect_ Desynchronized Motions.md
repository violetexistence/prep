# Effect: Desynchronized Motions
## Level 1
### 






Granted by [[Class Features/Desynchronized Motions|Desynchronized Motions]]

As your body speeds faster and faster, you risk falling out of sync with reality, as the world slows around you to the point that your interactions with it become strange and unpredictable.

**Mild Backlash** The friction of your motion through a slower world sets you alight. You take 2d4 persistent fire damage. At 5th level, and every 5 levels after, the persistent fire damage increases by 1d4. You take this persistent fire damage even if in a liquid environment, such as underwater, as your motion simply surrounds you in boiling water.

**Moderate Backlash** You fall out of phase with nearby matter, becoming trapped in the process. You take the mild backlash effects, catching on fire, and your legs also partially phase into the ground, making you [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]]. You can attempt to [[Actions/Escape|Escape]] against your deviation DC, or you can slowly extract yourself without attempting a check over the course of 1 minute.

**Severe Backlash** Your body accelerates to such a degree that your senses and impulses cannot keep up. You become trapped in your own mind for what seems like an eternity, taking 1d4 nonlethal mental damage for each level you have (1d4 mental). When you return, you are [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 3]] for 10 minutes, and then [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] until your next daily preparation. Your body ages one year during this time.
