# Stance: Ghosts in the Storm
## Level 12
### 






Granted by [[Feats/Ghosts in the Storm|Ghosts in the Storm]]

You and your allies while they're in your kinetic aura gain a +2 status bonus to Reflex saves and Acrobatics checks. When an affected creature uses a move action, clouds dance around it. Until the start of its next turn, it's concealed, and its Strikes gain the _shock_ rune.
