# Stance: Vitality-Manipulating Stance
## Level 1
### 






Granted by [[Feats/Vitality-Manipulating Stance|Vitality-Manipulating Stance]]

You gain a vitality blast ranged unarmed Strike that deals 1d4 void damage, has a range of 30 feet, and has the unarmed and versatile vitality traits.

Additionally, when you use Stunning Fist, instead of saving against being stunned, you can choose to have the target make a Fortitude save against your class DC with the following results. You must choose to do this before the target rolls its save.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target's muscles become temporarily weaker. For 1 round, the target is [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 2]], and any time it attempts to take an action with the manipulate trait, the action is disrupted unless it succeeds at a flat check with a DC equal to 5 + its enfeebled value.

**Failure** As success, but the duration is 1 minute.

**Critical Failure** As success, but the duration is 1 minute, the flat check is DC 11, and the target takes -10-foot status penalty to all Speeds for the duration.
