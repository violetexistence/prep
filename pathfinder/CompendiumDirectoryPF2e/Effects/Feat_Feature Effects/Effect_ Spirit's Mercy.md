# Effect: Spirit's Mercy
## Level 1
### 






Granted by [[Actions/Spirit's Mercy|Spirit's Mercy]]

You gain resistance to vitality and void damage (or resistance to all damage if caused by a haunt or incorporeal undead) against the triggering effect. If you expend a spirit wisp, the resistance is equal to twice your level. If you expend a spirit remnant, the resistance is equal to three times the level of the incorporeal undead or haunt from which you gained the remnant.
