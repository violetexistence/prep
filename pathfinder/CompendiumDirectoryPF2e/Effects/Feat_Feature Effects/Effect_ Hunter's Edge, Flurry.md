# Effect: Hunter's Edge, Flurry
## Level 1
### 






Granted when a ranger shares their [[Class Features/Flurry|Flurry]] edge with you.

Your multiple attack penalty for attacks against your hunted prey is -3 (-2 with an agile weapon) on your second attack of the turn instead of -5, and -6 (-4 with an agile weapon) on your third or subsequent attack of the turn, instead of -10.
