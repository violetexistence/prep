# Spell Effect: Envenom Companion
## Level 3
### 






Granted by [[Spells/Envenom Companion|Envenom Companion]]

The first time each round you hit a creature with an unarmed Strike that deals piercing or slashing damage, that Strike deals an additional 1d8 poison damage. A creature that is damaged by this poison must attempt a Fortitude save. On a failure, it's also clumsy 1 for 1 round.

* * *

**Heightened (+3)** The poison damage increases by 1d8 and the clumsy value imposed on a failed save increases by 1.
