# Spell Effect: Qi Form
## Level 9
### 






Granted by [[Spells/Qi Form|Qi Form]]

You gain a fly Speed equal to your land Speed. Choose force, spirit, vitality, or void damage. All your Strikes deal 1d6 additional damage of the chosen type.

Your entire body is also surrounded by a glowing corona of the same color as your inner qi; this is a light effect. Your corona is an aura in a 5-foot emanation that deals 2d6 untyped damage of the chosen type to creatures who start their turn within the emanation. You can Sustain to flare your corona out to become a 30-foot emanation or return the corona to a 5-foot emanation.

Your weapons and unarmed attacks lose the nonlethal trait. You take a -2 status penalty to saves against emotion effects but gain a +2 status bonus to saves against all other mental effects.
