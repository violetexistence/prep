Pick two of the options below. As a single action, which has the concentrate trait, you can change one of your chosen abilities to a different option from the list.

*   **Enlarging Eruption** You grow to size Large. You're clumsy 1. Your reach increases by 5 feet (or by 10 feet if you started out Tiny), and you gain a +2 status bonus to melee damage. You can't choose this option if you're already Large or larger.
