# Spell Effect: Moon Frenzy
## Level 5
### 






Granted by [[Spells/Moon Frenzy|Moon Frenzy]]

You gain temporary Hit Points, a +10-foot status bonus to your Speeds, and weakness to silver. You also grow vicious fangs and claws, which are unarmed attacks. If a target is in the light of a full moon, it also grows by one size if it were Medium or smaller. This increases the reach of a Medium or Tiny creature by 5 feet.
