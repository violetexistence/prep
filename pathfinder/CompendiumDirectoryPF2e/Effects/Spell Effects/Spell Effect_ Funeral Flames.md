# Spell Effect: Funeral Flames
## Level 1
### 






Granted by [[Spells/Funeral Flames|Funeral Flames]]

While you wield the target weapon, it becomes a +1 weapon, gains the versatile fire trait, and sheds light as brightly as a torch. Whenever you successfully Strike a creature with the weapon, you can Dismiss the spell as a free action to deal 1d6 persistent fire damage to the target; if the target is undead, increase the persistent damage dice to d8s.
