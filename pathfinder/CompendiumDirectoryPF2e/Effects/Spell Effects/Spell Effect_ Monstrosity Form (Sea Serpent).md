# Spell Effect: Monstrosity Form (Sea Serpent)
## Level 8
### 






Granted by [[Spells/Monstrosity Form|Monstrosity Form]]

You transform into a Huge battle form. While in this form, you gain the animal trait. You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of which battle form you choose:

*   AC = 20 + your level. Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction.
*   20 temporary Hit Points.
*   Darkvision.
*   One or more unarmed melee attacks specific to the battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you can Strike with. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +28, and you use the listed damage. These attacks are Strength based (for the purpose of the [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled]] condition, for example). If your unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead.
*   Athletics modifier of +30, unless your own modifier is higher.

You also gain specific abilities based on the type of monster you choose:

*   **Sea Serpent**
    
    *   Speed 20 feet, swim 90 feet;
    *   **Melee** `pf2:1` jaws (reach 15 feet), **Damage** 2d12+20 piercing;
    *   **Melee** `pf2:1` tail (reach 25 feet), **Damage** 2d8+20 bludgeoning;
    *   **Spine Rake** `pf2:2` (move) You extend your spines and Swim or Stride. Each creature you're adjacent to at any point during your movement takes 4d8+10 slashing damage (`Reflex check` against your spell DC).

* * *

**Heightened (9th)** You instead gain AC = 22 + your level, 25 temporary HP, attack modifier +31, increase damage by one damage die, and Athletics +33.
