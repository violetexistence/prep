# Spell Effect: Monstrosity Form (Phoenix)
## Level 8
### 






Granted by [[Spells/Monstrosity Form|Monstrosity Form]]

You transform into a Huge battle form. While in this form, you gain the beast trait. You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of which battle form you choose:

*   AC = 20 + your level. Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction.
*   20 temporary Hit Points.
*   Darkvision.
*   One or more unarmed melee attacks specific to the battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you can Strike with. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +28, and you use the listed damage. These attacks are Strength based (for the purpose of the [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled]] condition, for example). If your unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead.
*   Athletics modifier of +30, unless your own modifier is higher.

You also gain specific abilities based on the type of monster you choose:

*   **Phoenix**
    
    *   Speed 30 feet, fly 90 feet;
    *   **Melee** `pf2:1` beak (reach 15 feet), **Damage** 2d6+12 piercing plus 2d4 fire and 2d4 persistent fire;
    *   **Melee** `pf2:1` talon (agile, reach 15 feet), **Damage** 2d8+12 slashing;
    *   **Shroud of Flame** (aura, fire, primal) 20 feet. You gain an aura of fire that extends out from you. A creature that enters or ends its turn within the aura takes 2d6 fire damage. A creature can take this damage only once per turn. You can activate or deactivate this aura with a Sustain action.

* * *

**Heightened (9th)** You instead gain AC = 22 + your level, 25 temporary HP, attack modifier +31, increase damage by one damage die, and Athletics +33.
