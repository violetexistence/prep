# Spell Effect: Element Embodied (Fire)
## Level 10
### 






Granted by [[Spells/Element Embodied|Element Embodied]]

You transform into a Gargantuan elemental battle form. While in this form, you gain the elemental trait and the fire trait. You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of which battle form you choose:

*   AC = 25 + your level. Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction.
*   30 temporary Hit Points.
*   Darkvision.
*   One or more attacks specific to the battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you can use. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +34, and you use the listed damage. These attacks are Dexterity based if you choose an air or fire elemental, or Strength based if you choose an earth or water elemental. (This distinction doesn't change the statistics, but matters for the enfeebled and clumsy conditions, for example). If your unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead.
*   Acrobatics modifier of +36 for air or fire elemental or Athletics modifier of +36 for earth or water elemental, unless your own modifier is higher.

You also gain specific abilities based on the type of elemental you choose:

*   **Fire Elemental** 50 feet; immunity to fire; weakness to cold 10;
    
    *   **Intense Heat** (aura, fire) 30 feet. A creature that enters the aura or starts its turn in the aura takes 5d6 fire damage with a `Reflex check` save against your spell DC. A creature can take damage from the aura only once per round;
    *   **Melee** `pf2:1` tendril (reach 25 feet), **Damage** 3d10+12 fire plus 2d6 persistent fire;
    *   **Ranged** `pf2:1` fire mote (range increment 60 feet), **Damage** 4d8+6 bludgeoning.
