# Spell Effect: Dinosaur Form (Brontosaurus)
## Level 4
### 






Granted by [[Spells/Dinosaur Form|Dinosaur Form]]

You transform into a Large animal battle form, specifically that of a powerful and terrifying dinosaur. While in this form, you gain the animal and dinosaur traits. You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of which battle form you choose:

*   AC = 18 + your level. Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction.
*   15 temporary Hit Points.
*   Low-light vision and imprecise scent 30 feet.
*   One or more unarmed melee attacks specific to the battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you can Strike with. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +16, and your damage bonus is +9. These attacks are Strength based (for the purpose of the [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled]] condition, for example). If your unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead.
*   Athletics modifier of +18, unless your own modifier is higher.

You also gain specific abilities based on the form you choose:

*   **Brontosaurus**
    
    *   Speed 25 feet;
    *   **Melee** `pf2:1` tail (reach 15 feet), Damage 2d6 bludgeoning;
    *   **Melee** `pf2:1` foot, Damage 2d8 bludgeoning.

* * *

**Heightened (5th)** Your battle form is Huge and your attacks have 15-foot reach, or 20-foot reach if they started with 15-foot reach. You instead gain 20 temporary HP, an attack modifier of +18, a damage bonus of +6, double the damage dice, and Athletics +21.

**Heightened (7th)** Your battle form is Gargantuan and your attacks have 20-foot reach, or 25-foot reach if they started with 15-foot reach. You instead gain AC = 21 + your level, 25 temporary HP, an attack modifier of +25, a damage bonus of +15, double the damage dice, and Athletics +25.
