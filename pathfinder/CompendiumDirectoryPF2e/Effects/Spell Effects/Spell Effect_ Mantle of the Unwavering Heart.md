Pick two of the options below. As a single action, which has the concentrate trait, you can change one of your chosen abilities to a different option from the list.

*   **Evergreen Vitality** You gain fast healing 3 and a +2 bonus to saves against poison and disease. This effect has the healing and vitality traits.
*   **Overwhelming Perfume** (aura, olfactory) A cloud of potent floral scent surrounds you in a 15-foot emanation. Creatures in the aura can't benefit from the scent ability and are sickened 1 as long as they remain in the aura. The sickness is a disease effect.
*   **Towering Trunk** You grow to your size to Large. You're clumsy 1. Your reach increases by 5 feet (or by 10 feet if you started out Tiny), and you gain a grasping branch unarmed attack; this attack is in the brawling weapon group and deals 2d8 bludgeoning damage plus Grab.
*   **Unyielding Will** You're immune to being fascinated, and you get a +1 bonus to saves and DCs against mental effects.
