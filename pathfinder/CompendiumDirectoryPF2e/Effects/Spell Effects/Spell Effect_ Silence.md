# Spell Effect: Silence
## Level 2
### 






Granted by [[Spells/Silence|Silence]]

You make no sound, preventing creatures from noticing you using hearing alone.

* * *

**Heightened (4th)** The spell creates an aura in a 10-foot emanation around you, silencing all sound in or passing through it. While within the aura, creatures are subject to the same effects as the target.
