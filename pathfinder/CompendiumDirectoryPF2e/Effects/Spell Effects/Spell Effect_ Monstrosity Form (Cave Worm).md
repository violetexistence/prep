# Spell Effect: Monstrosity Form (Cave Worm)
## Level 8
### 






Granted by [[Spells/Monstrosity Form|Monstrosity Form]]

You transform into a Huge battle form. While in this form, you gain the animal trait. You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of which battle form you choose:

*   AC = 20 + your level. Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction.
*   20 temporary Hit Points.
*   Darkvision.
*   One or more unarmed melee attacks specific to the battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you can Strike with. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +28, and you use the listed damage. These attacks are Strength based (for the purpose of the [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled]] condition, for example). If your unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead.
*   Athletics modifier of +30, unless your own modifier is higher.

You also gain specific abilities based on the type of monster you choose:

*   **Cave Worm**
    
    *   Speed 40 feet, burrow 30 feet, swim 20 feet;
    *   **Melee** `pf2:1` jaws (reach 10 feet), **Damage** 2d12+20 piercing;
    *   **Melee** `pf2:1` stinger (agile, reach 10 feet), **Damage** 2d8+15 piercing plus 2d6 persistent poison;
    *   **Melee** `pf2:1` body (reach 10 feet) **Damage** 2d8+20 bludgeoning;
    *   **Inexorable** You automatically recover from the [[Conditions/Paralyzed|Paralyzed]], [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed]], and [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned]] conditions at the end of each of your turns. You're also immune to being [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] and ignore difficult terrain and greater difficult terrain.

* * *

**Heightened (9th)** You instead gain AC = 22 + your level, 25 temporary HP, attack modifier +31, increase damage by one damage die, and Athletics +33.
