Granted by [[Spells/Ferrous Form|Ferrous Form]]

You gain resistance to physical damage, except adamantine. You're immune to death effects, disease, drained, fatigued, healing, nonlethal attacks, paralyzed, poison, sickened, vitality, and void.

Your fist Strikes have a 1d10 damage die, and your metal spells deal one additional die of damage (of the same damage die and damage type the spell uses).
