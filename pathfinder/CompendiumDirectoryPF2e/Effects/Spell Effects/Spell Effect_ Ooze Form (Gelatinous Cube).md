# Spell Effect: Ooze Form (Gelatinous Cube)
## Level 3
### 






Granted by [[Spells/Ooze Form|Ooze Form]]

You transform into a Medium ooze battle form. While in this form, you gain the ooze trait. You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of which battle form you choose:

*   AC = 7 + your level. Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction.
*   20 temporary Hit Points.
*   You are immune to critical hits, precision damage, and visual effects.
*   Resistance 5 to acid, piercing, and slashing damage.
*   No vision and motion sense 30 feet. You can sense nearby motion through vibration and air movement as a precise sense.
*   One or more unarmed melee attacks specific to the battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you can Strike with. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +14, and you use the listed damage. These attacks are Strength based (for the purpose of the enfeebled condition, for example). If your unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead.
*   Athletics modifier of +14, unless your own is higher.

You also gain specific abilities based on the ooze:

*   **Gelatinous Cube** Speed 15 feet;
    
    *   **Melee** `pf2:1` cube face, **Damage** 1d6+5 acid;
    *   a creature hit by your cube face Strike must succeed at a Fortitude save against your spell DC or be [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]] (or [[Conditions/Paralyzed|Paralyzed]] for 1 round on a critical failure); this save has the incapacitation trait.
