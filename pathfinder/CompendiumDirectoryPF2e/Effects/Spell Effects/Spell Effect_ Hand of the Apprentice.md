# Spell Effect: Hand of the Apprentice
## Level 1
### 






Granted by [[Spells/Hand of the Apprentice|Hand of the Apprentice]]

You deal the weapon's damage as if you had hit with a melee Strike, but adding your spellcasting ability modifier to damage, rather than your Strength modifier. On a critical success, you deal double damage, and you add the weapon's critical specialization effect.
