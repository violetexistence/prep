You transform into a Small angel battle form. You gain the angel and celestial traits. You have hands in this battle form. You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of the form that you choose:

Melee attacks are Strength based (for the purpose of the enfeebled condition, for example), and ranged attacks are Dexterity based. If your attack modifier is higher for the given unarmed attack or weapon, you can use it instead.
