## Level 1
### 






Granted by [[Spells/Sage's Curse|Sage's Curse]]

The target must roll twice and use the worse result whenever attempting an Arcana, Lore, Occultism, or Society check. On a critical failure, the target treats the outcomes of all checks to Recall Knowledge as one degree of success worse than the result rolled.
