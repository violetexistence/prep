# Spell Effect: See the Unseen
## Level 1
### 






Granted by [[Spells/See the Unseen|See the Unseen]]

You can see invisible creatures as though they weren't invisible, although their features are blurred, making them [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] and difficult to identify. You also gain a +2 status bonus to checks you make to disbelieve illusions.
