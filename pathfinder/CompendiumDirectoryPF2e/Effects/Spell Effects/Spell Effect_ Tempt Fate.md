Granted by [[Spells/Tempt Fate|Tempt Fate]]

You gain a status bonus to the triggering saving throw. If the saving throw's result is a success, it becomes a critical success. If it's a failure, it becomes a critical failure, and the critical failure can't be reduced by abilities that usually reduce critical failure.
