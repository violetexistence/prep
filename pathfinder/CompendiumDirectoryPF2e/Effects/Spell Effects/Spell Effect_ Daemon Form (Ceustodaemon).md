# Spell Effect: Daemon Form (Ceustodaemon)
## Level 6
### 






Granted by [[Spells/Daemon Form|Daemon Form]]

You transform into a Medium daemon battle form. While in this form, you gain the daemon and fiend traits. You have hands in this battle form and can use manipulate actions. You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of the form that you choose:

*   AC = 21 + your level. Ignore your armor check's penalty and Speed reduction.
*   15 temporary Hit Points and weakness 5 to holy.
*   A +2 status bonus to all saving throws against death effects.
*   Resistance 10 to poison.
*   Darkvision.
*   One or more attacks specific to the battle form you use. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +21, and you use the listed damage. These attacks are Strength based (for the purpose of the enfeebled condition, for example). If your unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead.
*   Athletics modifier of +23, unless your own modifier is higher.

You also gain specific abilities based on the type of Daemon you choose:

*   **Ceustodaemon** Speed 25 feet;
    
    *   **Melee** `pf2:1` jaws (reach 10 feet), **Damage** 2d10+10 piercing plus 1d6 spirit;
    *   **Melee** `pf2:1` claw (agile, reach 10 feet), **Damage** 2d6 slashing plus 1d6 spirit;
    *   any successful jaws or claw Strike deals an additional 1d6 damage, and you take the same amount of damage.
