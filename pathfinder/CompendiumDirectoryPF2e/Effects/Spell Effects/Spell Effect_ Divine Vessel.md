## Level 7
### 






Granted by [[Spells/Divine Vessel|Divine Vessel]]

You accept otherworldly energies into your body; while you are still recognizably yourself, you gain the features of one of your deity's servitors. Choose an alignment your deity has (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful). You can't cast this spell if you don't have a deity or your deity is true neutral. This spell gains the trait of the alignment you chose.

If you were Medium or smaller, you become Large, as the effects of [[Spells/Enlarge|Enlarge]]. You must have space to expand into, or the spell is lost. You also gain the following benefits.
