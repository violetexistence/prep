# Spell Effect: Humanoid Form
## Level 2
### 






Granted by [[Spells/Humanoid Form|Humanoid Form]]

You transform your appearance to that of a Small or Medium humanoid. You gain the humanoid trait. If this transformation reduces your size, it reduces your reach accordingly (typically to 5 feet). You gain a +4 status bonus to Deception checks to pass as a generic member of the chosen ancestry, and you add your level even if you're untrained, but you can't make yourself look like a specific person.

**Heightened (3rd)** You gain darkvision or low-light vision if the form you assume has that ability.

**Heightened (5th)** You can take on the appearance of a Large humanoid. If this increases your size, you gain the effects of the enlarge spell.
