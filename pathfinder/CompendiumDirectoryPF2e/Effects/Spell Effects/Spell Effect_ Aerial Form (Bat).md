# Spell Effect: Aerial Form (Bat)
## Level 4
### 






Granted by [[Spells/Aerial Form|Aerial Form]]

You transform into a Medium flying animal battle form. You gain the animal trait, and gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of which battle form you choose:

*   AC = 18 + your level. Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction.
*   5 temporary Hit Points.
*   Low-light vision.
*   One or more unarmed melee attacks specific to the battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you can Strike with. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +16, and your damage bonus is +5. These attacks are Dexterity based (for the purpose of the [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy]] condition, for example). If your attack modifier for Dexterity-based unarmed attacks is higher, you can use it instead.
*   Acrobatics modifier of +16, unless your own modifier is higher.

You also gain specific abilities based on the form you choose:

*   **Bat**
    
    *   Speed 20 feet, fly Speed 30 feet; precise echolocation 40 feet;
    *   **Melee** `pf2:1` fangs, **Damage** 2d8 piercing;
    *   **Melee** `pf2:1` wing (agile), **Damage** 2d6 bludgeoning.

* * *

**Heightened (6th)** Your battle form is Huge, your fly Speed gains a +15-foot status bonus, and your attacks have 10-foot reach. You must have enough space to expand into or the spell is lost. You instead gain AC = 21 + your level, 15 temporary HP, attack modifier +21, damage bonus +4 and double damage dice (including persistent damage), and Acrobatics +23.
