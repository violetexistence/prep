# Spell Effect: Aberrant Form (Gug)
## Level 5
### 






Granted by [[Spells/Aberrant Form|Aberrant Form]]

You transform yourself into a Large aberration. You gain the aberration trait, as well as the following statistics and abilities:

*   AC = 18 + your level. Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction.
*   13 temporary Hit Points.
*   Darkvision.
*   One or more unarmed melee attacks specific to the battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you can Strike with. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +18, and you use the listed damage. These attacks are Strength based (for the purpose of the enfeebled condition, for example). If your unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead.
*   Athletics modifier of +20, unless your own modifier is higher.

You also gain specific abilities based on the type of aberration you choose:

*   **Gug**
    
    *   Speed 40 feet, climb 20 feet;
    *   **Melee** `pf2:1` jaws (reach 10 feet), **Damage** 2d12+8 piercing;
    *   **Melee** `pf2:1` claw (agile, reach 10 feet), **Damage** 2d8+8 slashing;
    *   your multiple joints allow you to fit through tight spaces as if you were a Medium creature.

* * *

**Heightened (6th)** Your battle form is Huge, and the reach of your attacks increases by 5 feet. You must have space to expand, or the spell is lost. You instead gain AC = 21 + your level, 26 temporary HP, attack modifier +22, damage bonus +13, and Athletics +23.
