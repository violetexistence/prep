You gain a benefit depending on the instinct the crown is tied to

*   **Animal** You gain 10 additional temporary Hit Points. You deal 3 additional damage with your animal's unarmed attacks, and those unarmed attacks gain the deadly d8 trait.
*   **Fury** You become Quickened. You can use the extra action only to Stride or Strike.
*   **Giant** You become Large and your equipment grows with you. Increase your reach by 5 feet (or by 10 feet if you were Tiny). You deal 2 additional damage when using your larger weapon.
*   **Spirit** Your raging resistance applies to all physical damage and poison damage. This resistance is halved against magical attacks.
*   **Superstition** When you attempt a saving throw against magic, roll twice and take the higher result. Also, your raging resistance applies to all magic traditions.
