# Effect: Spined Shield Spines
## Level 7
### 






Granted by [[Equipment/Spined Shield|Spined Shield]]

When you use the Shield Block reaction with this shield, the spines take the damage before the shield itself does. When the shield would take damage (after applying Hardness), one spine snaps off per 6 damage, reducing the damage by 6.
