# Effect: Sanguine Mutagen (Greater)
## Level 11
### 






Granted by [[Equipment/Sanguine Mutagen (Greater)|Sanguine Mutagen (Greater)]]

**Benefit** You gain a +3 item bonus to Fortitude and Reflex saves. This bonus improves to +4 when you attempt a save against an effect that has the disease trait, poison trait, or would give you the Fatigued condition.

When you roll a success on a save against a disease, poison, or effect that would give you the Fatigued condition, you get a critical success instead.

**Drawback** Whenever you take piercing or slashing damage, you take 1d6 bleed.
