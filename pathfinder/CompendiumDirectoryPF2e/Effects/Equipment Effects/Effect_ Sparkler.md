# Effect: Sparkler
## Level 1
### 






Granted by [[Equipment/Sparkler|Sparkler]]

The sparkler emits bright light in a 10-foot radius (and dim light for the next 10 feet). While the sparkler burns, you can use it as an improvised weapon, dealing 1 fire damage on a hit. On a critical hit, you cause the target to become dazzled for 1 round.
