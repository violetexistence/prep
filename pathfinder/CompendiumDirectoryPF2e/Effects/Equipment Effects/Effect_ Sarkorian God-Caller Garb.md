# Effect: Sarkorian God-Caller Garb
## Level 6
### 






As long as it is within 30 feet of you, the summoned creature gains a +1 status bonus to AC. If it ever moves farther than 30 feet from you, the sigil fades and the creature loses the status bonus to AC, even if it later comes within 30 feet of you again.
