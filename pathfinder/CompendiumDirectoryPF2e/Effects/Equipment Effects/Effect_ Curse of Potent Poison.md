# Effect: Curse of Potent Poison
## Level 1
### 






This curse magically speeds poison through your body.

* * *

**Effect** You take a -1 status penalty to Fortitude saves and you gain weakness 3 to poison (if you already have weakness to poison, increase it by 3). The curse remains until removed by [[Spells/Cleanse Affliction|Cleanse Affliction]] or similar magic.
