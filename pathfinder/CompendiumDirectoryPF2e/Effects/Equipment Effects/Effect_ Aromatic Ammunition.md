# Effect: Aromatic Ammunition
## Level 2
### 






Granted by [[Equipment/Aromatic Ammunition|Aromatic Ammunition]]

Any creatures within 30 feet smell the target, allowing even those with a weak sense of smell to detect its presence, and all creatures gain a +1 item bonus to Track the affected creature for as long as it has the odor. A creature that has imprecise or precise scent doubles the range at which they can detect the target using their scent compared to the normal range of their scent.
