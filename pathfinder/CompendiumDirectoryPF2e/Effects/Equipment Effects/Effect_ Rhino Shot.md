Granted by [[Equipment/Rhino Shot|Rhino Shot]]

On a successful Strike, your attack deals an additional 2d6 force damage, and the target must succeed at a DC 19 Fortitude save or be knocked Prone. If the hit with the _rhino shot_ was a critical success, the target is knocked prone unless it critically succeeds at its save.
