# Effect: Azarim
## Level 7
### 






Granted by [[Equipment/Azarim|Azarim]]

_Azarim_ gains the effects of an _anarchic_ weapon rune for 1 minute. When wielded by a character who's at least 11th level, _Azarim_ becomes a _+2 striking anarchic shifting rapier_, and instead this activation can be applied to another weapon that's in physical contact with _Azarim_.
