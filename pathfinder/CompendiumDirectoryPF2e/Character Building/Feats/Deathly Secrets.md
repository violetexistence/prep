# Deathly Secrets
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Reanimator Dedication
* * *
No means of creating or ruling the undead is beyond your grasp, even those of magical traditions not your own. You learn either the [[Spells/Eyes of the Dead|Eyes of the Dead]] or [[Spells/Subjugate Undead|Subjugate Undead]] focus spell. If you don't already have one, you gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point, which you can Refocus by meditating over the earthly remains of a dead sentient creature. Focus spells granted by the reanimator archetype are from the same tradition as those used to meet the archetype's prerequisite.

**Special** You can select this feat more than once. Each time, you learn a different spell and your focus pool increases by 1 Focus Point.
