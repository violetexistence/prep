## Feat 9
### [[morph]][[primal]][[yaksha]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per day

You intone vows to shoulder others' pains; in response, your torso sprouts an additional pair of arms to help you bear those burdens. For the following minute, you can carry 3 more Bulk than normal before becoming encumbered and up to a maximum of 6 more Bulk. You can also use these arms as free hands to perform only the following actions or activities: [[Actions/Disarm|Disarm]], [[Actions/Grapple|Grapple]], [[Actions/Shove|Shove]], and [[Actions/Trip|Trip]]. After this minute or when you become [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]], whichever comes first, these additional arms fade away.
