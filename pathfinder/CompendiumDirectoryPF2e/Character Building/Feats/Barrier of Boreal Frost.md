## Feat 14
### [[cold]][[impulse]][[kineticist]][[manipulate]][[overflow]][[primal]][[water]]

**Category** class; 




You form an intricate structure of ice, such as a wall of bricks made of packed snow or a screen of enormous icicles. This has the effect of a [[Spells/Wall of Ice|Wall of Ice]] spell with a spell rank equal to half your level rounded up. It can only be a wall (not a hemisphere), and you choose whether the ice is transparent or opaque. The wall lasts until the end of your next turn, but you can Sustain it up to 1 minute.
