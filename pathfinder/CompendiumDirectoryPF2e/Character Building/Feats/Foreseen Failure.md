# Foreseen Failure `pf2:0`
## Feat 12
### [[fortune]][[occult]][[psychic]]

**Category** class; 




**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** A spell you cast has no effect because you critically failed all your spell attack rolls or because all targets critically succeeded at their saving throws.

* * *

You see your spell fail to take hold to disastrous end, then snap back to reality-it was all a precognition, and you know to try a different spell. Your spell is expended, but you can [[Actions/Cast a Spell|Cast a Spell]] that requires the same number of actions as the triggering spell or fewer to cast. The second spell must be a different spell than the first.
