# Improved Swift Banishment
## Feat 18
### [[cleric]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Swift Banishment
* * *
You easily banish creatures with your weapon. You can use [[Feats/Swift Banishment|Swift Banishment]] as long as you have a spell slot of 5th rank or higher remaining, even if you don't have [[Spells/Banishment|Banishment]] prepared. You must sacrifice a prepared spell of 5th rank or higher, and the _banishment_ effect you create is heightened to the rank of that spell. The target takes a â€“2 circumstance penalty to its save as though you'd paid the extra cost for _banishment_.
