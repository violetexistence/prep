### [[archetype]][[emotion]][[mental]][[visual]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Celebrity Dedication
* * *
When you meet someone's gaze, they're unable to look away from you. Choose one target creature you can see and that can see you. That creature must succeed at a `Will check` save or be [[Conditions/Fascinated|Fascinated]] with you until the end of your next turn; the DC is the higher of your class DC or spell DC. If the creature succeeds at its save or its fascination ends due to a hostile action, it becomes temporarily immune to your Mesmerizing Gaze for 1 day.
