# Cushion Landing `pf2:r`
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** Cavalier Dedication; trained in Nature
* * *
**Trigger** You fall from a height of 15 feet or higher.

**Requirements** Your mount can reach your landing location with a single Stride.

* * *

As you fall, your mount dashes to your rescue. Your mount Strides up to its Speed, positioning itself below you. Rather than falling on your mount, you [[Actions/Mount|Mount]] your mount. Treat the triggering fall as if it were 15 feet shorter, and you don't land [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] (though both you and your mount both take damage from the fall based on what you would normally take for any remaining distance).
