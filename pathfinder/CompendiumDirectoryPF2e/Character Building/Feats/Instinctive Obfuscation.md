# Instinctive Obfuscation `pf2:r`
## Feat 13
### [[gnome]][[illusion]][[visual]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** at least one arcane or occult innate spell gained from a gnome heritage or gnome ancestry feat
* * *
**Frequency** once per hour

**Trigger** You are attacked by a foe, but they haven't rolled yet.

* * *

The magic within you manifests as a natural reaction to threats. An illusory double of you appears in your space for a brief moment. The triggering attacker must roll a `DC 10 Flat check`; on a success, the attack targets you normally; if they fail, the attack targets the double and destroys it. The tradition of this action matches the tradition of your gnome ancestry options.
