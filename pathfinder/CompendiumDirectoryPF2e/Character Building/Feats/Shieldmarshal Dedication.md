# Shieldmarshal Dedication
## Feat 2
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[archetype]][[dedication]]

**Category** class; 




Your elite shieldmarshal training makes you equally at home in the squalor of Smokeside and the splendor of Skyside. You're intimately familiar with the city's labyrinthine streets and statutes. You become trained in Society; if you were already trained, you become an expert in Society instead. In urban environments, you can attempt [[Actions/sense-direction skill=society|sense-direction skill=society]]{Society} checks to [[Actions/Sense Direction|Sense Direction]]. You also gain the [[Feats/Courtly Graces|Courtly Graces]] and [[Feats/Streetwise|Streetwise]] skill feats.
