**Prerequisites** Ascended Celestial Dedication

**Requirements** Your nimbus is active.

With a righteous word, your divine aura inspires your allies to great heroics and causes foes to tremble. Spend 1 Mythic Point. All allies in the bright light of your nimbus gain a +3 status bonus to attack rolls and skill checks, and the status bonus they receive to saving throws against fear increases to +3. These bonuses last for 1 minute or as long as they remain in the bright light of your nimbus, whichever comes first.

[[Feat_Feature Effects/Effect_ Shining Glory|Effect: Shining Glory]]

Each enemy in the bright light of your nimbus attempts a `Will check` saving throw against your class DC or spell DC (whichever is higher) with the following effects. For the next minute, an enemy can't reduce its frightened condition below 1 while it remains in the bright light of your nimbus.

**Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] and you are [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] to that creature while it has the frightened condition.

**Critical Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 3]] and you are [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] to that creature while it has the frightened condition.
