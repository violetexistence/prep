# Driving Rain `pf2:3`
## Feat 6
### [[impulse]][[kineticist]][[overflow]][[primal]][[water]]

**Category** class; 




Heavy drops of rain batter down, hitting like sling stones and impeding vision. Each creature in a 15-foot burst within 120 feet takes 0d8 bludgeoning damage with a `Reflex check` save against your class DC. Until the start of your next turn, all creatures are [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] while in the area, and all creatures outside the area are concealed to creatures within it.

* * *

**Level (+2)** The damage increases by 1d8.
