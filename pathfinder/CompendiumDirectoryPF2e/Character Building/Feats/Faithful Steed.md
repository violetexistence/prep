# Faithful Steed
## Feat 1
### [[champion]]

**Category** class; 




You gain the service of a young animal companion as a mount. See Animal Companions. If you have the holy or unholy trait, your mount gains it as well, as do the mount's Strikes. Typically, the steed is an animal companion with the mount ability (such as a horse). The GM might allow another animal companion option, or allow the creature to have a different appearance that thematically fits your deity.
