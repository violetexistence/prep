# Retaliating Rescue `pf2:2`
## Feat 6
### [[guardian]]

**Category** class; 




When an ally is in danger, you can hustle to reach them and punish the foe threatening them. Stride up to your Speed. You must end this movement adjacent to an ally who is within an enemy's reach. Then, you push your ally up to 5 feet (as normal for forced movement, this movement doesn't trigger reactions) and make a melee Strike against an enemy within your reach. If your ally was in that enemy's reach and your push moved them out of it, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your attack roll.
