# Wild Strider
## Feat 12
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Horizon Walker Dedication
* * *
Natural obstacles pose no obstacle to you. You gain the ranger's [[Class Features/Unimpeded Journey|Wild Stride]] class feature. This allows you to ignore the effects of all non-magical difficult terrain, treat greater difficult terrain as merely difficult terrain, and gives you an additional benefit from [[Feats/Favored Terrain|Favored Terrain]] based on the terrain.
