# Chorus Companion
## Feat 12
### [[bard]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** zoophonia muse; mature animal companion
* * *
Animals can be musical partners as much as the subjects or audience. Your animal companion becomes trained in Performance (or expert if it was already trained). When you cast a composition spell, you can have it originate either from you or from your animal companion, if your animal companion is within 30 feet of you.
