# Cautious Word `pf2:0`
## Feat 12
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Uzunjati Storytelling; ability to cast shield
* * *
**Trigger** An enemy hits you with a Strike.

**Requirements** You're currently unable to cast [[Spells/Shield|Shield]] because you used [[Feats/Shield Block|Shield Block]] with it.

* * *

You let your words defend you, just as your allies in the Vellumis Scholars defend through knowledge. You immediately cast _shield_ and gain its bonus to AC even though you normally couldn't cast it, and you become [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] for 1 round.
