# Fake Out `pf2:r`
## Feat 2
### [[gunslinger]][[visual]]

**Category** class; 




**Trigger** An ally is about to use an action that requires an attack roll, targeting a creature within your weapon's first range increment.

**Requirements** You're wielding a loaded firearm or crossbow.

* * *

With a skilled flourish of your weapon, you force an enemy to acknowledge you as a threat. Make an attack roll to [[Actions/Aid|Aid]] the triggering attack. If you dealt damage to that enemy with the same weapon since the start of your last turn, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to this roll.
