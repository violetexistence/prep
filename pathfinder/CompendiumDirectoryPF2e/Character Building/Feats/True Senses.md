# True Senses `pf2:2`
## Feat 17
### [[awakened-animal]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Natural Senses
* * *
**Frequency** once per day

* * *

Your senses are so sharp they pierce through all illusions. You can heighten your senses to non-magically gain the effects of a 6th-rank [[Spells/Truesight|Truesight]] spell for 10 minutes. The ability to "see through" illusions and polymorph effects applies to any precise sense you possess.
