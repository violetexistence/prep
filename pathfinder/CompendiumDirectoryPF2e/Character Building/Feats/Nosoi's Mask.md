# Nosoi's Mask
## Feat 1
### [[duskwalker]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Crafting

Many psychopomps wear masks when dealing with the living, and many cultures believe that seeing an unmasked psychopomp's face invites death.

You are trained in Intimidation and gain the [[Feats/Intimidating Glare|Intimidating Glare]] skill feat. If you were already trained in Intimidation (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.

You also know how to make masks like those worn by psychopomps, a process that takes 1 hour and 1 sp of appropriate material. If you instead pay 50 gp for a splendid psychopomp mask, the mask grants you a +1 item bonus to Intimidation while you are wearing it. Its usage is worn (mask).
