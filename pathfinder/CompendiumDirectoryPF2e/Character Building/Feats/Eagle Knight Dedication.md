You gain the [[Feats/Additional Lore|Additional Lore]] skill feat for Politics Lore. If you were already trained in Politics Lore, you also become trained in a Lore skill of your choice. You can use Politics Lore to [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] on or make a [[Actions/Request|Request]] of government officials (or similar figures) or to Gather Information about them. If you critically succeed at a check to [[Actions/Gather Information|Gather Information]] with Politics Lore, you know the information without having to spend any time gathering it.
