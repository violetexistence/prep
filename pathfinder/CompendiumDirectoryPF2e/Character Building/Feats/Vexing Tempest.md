# Vexing Tempest `pf2:1`
## Feat 12
### [[air]][[archetype]][[spellshape]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Familiar Sage Dedication; Tempest Cloud's Speed
* * *
Your familiar channels elemental air around it to unleash a disruptive gust that sends creatures flying. If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell that has the air trait, all creatures within a 15-foot emanation of your familiar must attempt a Reflex save against your spell DC or be pushed 10 feet away. On a critical failure, they're also knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]].
