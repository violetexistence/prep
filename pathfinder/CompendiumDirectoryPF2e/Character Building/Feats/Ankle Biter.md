# Ankle Biter
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Zombie Dedication
* * *
You fight just as well on the ground as you do standing up. While you are [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]], you are always [[Actions/Take Cover|Taking Cover]] against ranged attacks, you ignore the status penalty on your attack rolls from being prone, and you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks to [[Actions/Trip|Trip]].

You can choose to move up to half your Speed when you [[Actions/Crawl|Crawl]]. You can instead move up to your full Speed when you Crawl, but if you do, you must succeed at a `DC 6 Flat check` or your body deteriorates.
