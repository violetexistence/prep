# Ambush Tactics
## Feat 4
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[general]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Lore about a specific terrain
* * *
You've made a study of the best practices for laying ambushes in terrains you've spent time learning about, be it the best way to ambush foes or the best methods of reacting to surprise attacks in those terrains. In any combat during which an enemy rolls Stealth to determine initiative, you can choose to roll initiative using a Lore check that's appropriate for the encounter's terrain, if you're trained in the appropriate Lore skill.
