# Clinging Shadows Initiate
## Feat 8
### [[monk]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Qi Spells
* * *
You learn a mystical stance that transforms your qi into sticky smoke that shrouds your limbs. You gain the [[Spells/Clinging Shadows Stance|Clinging Shadows Stance]] qi spell. While entering the stance is a qi spell, the shadow grasp attacks it grants are not, so you can use them as often as you like while in the stance.
