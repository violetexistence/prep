# Growth Spell `pf2:1`
## Feat 10
### [[archetype]][[spellshape]][[wood]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Elementalist Dedication; wood is in your elemental philosophy
* * *
You enhance your spell with elemental wood, causing your magic to expand and grow beyond its original limitations. If the next action you use this turn is to Cast a non-cantrip Spell that affects an area, expand the area of the spell. For bursts, expand the radius by 5 feet; for cones, expand the cone by 10 feet; and for lines, expand the length by 15 feet. The spell gains the wood trait.
