# Threatening Pursuit `pf2:1`
## Feat 13
### [[auditory]][[minotaur]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** expert in Intimidation and Stealth
* * *
**Requirements** You are not observed by any enemies within 60 feet.

* * *

You emit a terrifying growl and snort, stamping your hooves for all to hear so that they know that you hunt them. Attempt an Intimidation check to [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] all enemies within 30 feet, and you do not take a penalty for not sharing a language. If the targets are in a maze or similarly difficult-to-navigate location, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to this check, and the range increases to 60 feet. Each target is temporarily immune for 1 hour.
