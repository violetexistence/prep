# Aegis for the Innocent `pf2:1`
## Feat 14
### [[manipulate]][[mythic]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Ascended Celestial Dedication
* * *
**Requirements** Your nimbus is active.

* * *

You transfer a portion of your divine spark to an ally, temporarily dimming your nimbus to encase an ally in a barrier of light that repels attackers. Select a willing creature within the bright light of your nimbus. You surround the target in a protective barrier of light; this is a 10-foot emanation centered on the target. This barrier lasts for 1 minute, or until you Dismiss it. While the Aegis of the Innocent is active, the area of your nimbus is halved.

The target gains a +1 status bonus to AC. Any enemy within the barrier, or entering the barrier, must attempt a `Fortitude check` saving throw against your class DC or your spell DC. A creature needs to attempt this save only once each round.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature becomes [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] for 1 round and treats the space within the barrier as difficult terrain.

**Failure** The creature becomes dazzled for 1 minute, is pushed 10 feet, and treats the space within the barrier as difficult terrain. If a creature would be pushed into a solid barrier or another creature, it stops at that point and takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature is also [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] for 1 round.
