# Alchemical Familiar
## Feat 1
### [[alchemist]]

**Category** class; 




You have used alchemy to create life, a simple creature formed from alchemical materials, reagents, and a bit of your own blood. You gain a familiar, which has the [[Familiar Abilities/Construct|Construct]] familiar ability; this is permanent, doesn't require the familiar to have the [[Familiar Abilities/Tough|Tough]] familiar ability, and doesn't count against your usual limit of familiar abilities (typically 2). The familiar uses your Intelligence modifier to determine its Perception, Acrobatics, and Stealth modifiers.
