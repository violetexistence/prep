**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** unholy
* * *
Your life has made you a nexus for your deity's vile power. You're continuously surrounded by a [[Spells/Bane|Bane]] spell, with a spell rank equal to half your level (rounded up). The radius is 15 feet, and you can't increase it. You can Dismiss the spell; if you do, it returns automatically after 1 minute.
