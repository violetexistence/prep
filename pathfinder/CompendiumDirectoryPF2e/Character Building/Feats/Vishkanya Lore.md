# Vishkanya Lore
## Feat 1
### [[vishkanya]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You deeply understand vishkanyan strengths and cultural traditions. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Performance and Stealth. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in Vishkanya Lore.
