## Feat 4
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Clawdancer Dedication
* * *
**Trigger** A creature attempts to Strike you while it's flanking you.

Your long clawed legs let you catch enemies to either side. You shift to talon stance if you weren't in it already. If the Strike misses, you can make a spinning talon Strike against any creature flanking you.
