# Wave the Flag `pf2:1`
## Feat 16
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[archetype]][[emotion]][[flourish]][[mental]][[visual]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Cavalier's Banner
* * *
You wave your banner, inspiring allies to throw off the shackles of fear. Each ally presently benefiting from your Cavalier's Banner feat reduces their current frightened condition by 1 and can choose to immediately attempt a new saving throw against any one mental effect currently affecting them. Regardless of the result, any ally that attempts a save is temporarily immune to Wave the Flag for 10 minutes.
