# Living God
## Feat 20
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Razmiran Priest Dedication; legendary in Crafting
* * *
You have reached heights of power equaling Razmir himself. You can Craft your [[Equipment/Razmiri Mask|Razmiri Mask]] out of porcelain laced with precious metals, or upgrade your existing mask to a porcelain one in the same time it takes to Craft one made of iron. A [[Equipment/Razmiri Mask (Porcelain)|Porcelain Razmiri Mask]] grants a +4 item bonus to Deception checks to [[Actions/Lie|Lie]] or [[Actions/Feint|Feint]], is an 18th-level item, and is an apex item that increases your Charisma modifier by 1 or increases it to +4, whichever would give you a higher score. It also gives you the following activation in addition to those granted by the standard, silver, and gold masks.

* * *

**Activateâ€”Power of the Living God** `pf2:1` (concentrate, manipulate, occult)

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You demand power from the world, using your mask as a locus to force reality to bend to your will. You cast [[Spells/Manifestation|Manifestation]] as a 10th-rank occult spell, but no matter what spell you emulate with it, that spell has the incapacitation trait.
