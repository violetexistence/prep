# Caterwaul `pf2:r`
## Feat 13
### [[auditory]][[catfolk]][[concentrate]][[emotion]][[mental]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** An ally within 30 feet would be reduced to 0 HP but not immediately killed.

* * *

You give a daring yowl, calling your companion back from the brink of unconsciousness. Your ally isn't knocked out and remains at 1 Hit Point. Their [[Conditions/Wounded|Wounded]] condition still increases by 1 as though they had been [[Conditions/Dying|Dying]] and recovered.
