# Mental Balm
## Feat 2
### [[amp]][[emotion]][[mental]][[psychic]]

**Category** class; 




Your spells release soothing mental waves. Use this amp in place of a psi cantrip's normal amp entry. You can use this amp only on a psi cantrip that targets or affects you or one or more of your allies and doesn't target or affect any enemies.

* * *

**Amp** You or one ally within 30 feet gains a +2 status bonus to Will saves against emotion effects for 1 minute. You can also have the amped psi cantrip attempt to counteract one effect imposing the [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened]] condition on yourself or the chosen ally, or an effect imposing the [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied]] condition that has a duration of 1 hour or less. If you successfully counteract the effect, you remove only the frightened and stupefied conditions, not any other part of the effect.
