## Feat 8
### [[investigator]]

**Category** class; 




You can clue in all your allies at once. When you use the Clue In reaction, any of your allies who are attempting the same check to investigate one of your active investigations receive the circumstance bonus from Clue In. If you use this ability during an encounter, they must attempt their check within 1 round of when you Clued them In.
