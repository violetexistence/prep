# Catch the Details
## Feat 1
### [[goloma]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You are quick at recognizing broad details about people and things around you. You are trained in Society and gain the [[Feats/Eye for Numbers|Eye for Numbers]] skill feat. If you would automatically become trained in Society (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.

_Note: If you are already trained in the skill provided by this feat, you need to manually select an alternative skill._
