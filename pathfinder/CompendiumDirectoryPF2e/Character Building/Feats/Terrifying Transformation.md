# Terrifying Transformation `pf2:1`
## Feat 8
### [[archetype]][[visual]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Werecreature Dedication; you were afflicted with the curse of the werecreature
* * *
Your flesh tears and warps as you transform. Attempt Intimidation checks to [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] each enemy within 30 feet. This Demoralize loses the auditory trait and gains the visual trait, and you don't take a penalty if a creature doesn't understand your language. Regardless of the results of your checks, each creature is temporarily immune to Terrifying Transformation for 1 minute.
