# That's Not Natural! `pf2:r`
## Feat 4
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[general]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** expert in Survival
* * *
Your mastery at surviving in the wild has given you a sort of sixth-sense when it comes to noticing creatures that aren't part of the natural order. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to all initiative checks made at the start of a battle in which at least one of your enemies is an aberration, fey, mutant, or undead, or if one of your enemies is from a plane other than the Material Plane, as long as the battle takes place in a wilderness region. In wilderness regions, you also increase your Perception DC by 1 against these types of creatures for the purposes of resolving their Stealth checks. If you're master in Survival, this circumstance bonus increases to +2.

If you know the [[Spells/Commune|Commune]] ritual, you can use Survival as a primary or secondary check to resolve that ritual-if you do so, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus.
