# Divine Health
## Feat 2
### [[champion]]

**Category** class; 




Your faith makes you resistant to disease, protecting you as you offer succor to the ill. You gain a +2 status bonus to saves against diseases and poisons and to flat checks to recover from persistent poison damage. Allies in your champion's aura get this benefit, but their bonus is +1.

In addition, if you roll a success on a save against a disease or poison, you get a critical success instead. (Your allies don't share this benefit.) If you have the sacred body class feature, when you roll a critical failure on a save against a disease or poison, you get a failure instead.
