# Murksight
## Feat 8
### [[witch]]

**Category** class; 




Your vision pierces through non-magical fog, mist, rain, and snow. You don't take circumstance penalties to ranged attacks or Perception checks caused by non-magical precipitation, and your targeted attacks don't require a flat check to succeed against a target [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] only by such effects.
