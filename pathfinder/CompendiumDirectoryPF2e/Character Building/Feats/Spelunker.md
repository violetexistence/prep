# Spelunker
## Feat 1
### [[shisk]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Living underground, you have learned to find your way without landmarks or even solid ground. If you roll a success on an Survival check to [[Actions/Sense Direction|Sense Direction]] or an Athletics check to [[Actions/Climb|Climb]], you get a critical success instead. You're not [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] when you attempt to Climb.
