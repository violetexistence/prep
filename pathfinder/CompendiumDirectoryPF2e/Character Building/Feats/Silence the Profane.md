# Silence the Profane `pf2:r`
## Feat 8
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Avenger Dedication or Vindicator Dedication
* * *
**Trigger** A creature you can observe within reach of your deity's favored weapon casts a spell.

**Requirements** You are wielding your deity's favored weapon.

* * *

Your training included instruction on how to prevent enemy priests from using their magic against you, a technique you have mastered and adapted. Make a Strike with your deity's favored weapon against the triggering creature. On a success, the target is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the end of your next turn. The triggering spell is disrupted on a critical success, or on a success if the target is your hunted prey and the spell is a divine spell.

* * *

**Special** If your deity's favored weapon is a ranged weapon, this reaction can trigger if the target is within its first range increment and you can make a ranged Strike instead of a melee Strike.
