# Corpse Tender Dedication
## Feat 2
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[archetype]][[dedication]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** evil alignment; trained in Religion
* * *
You have a connection to mindless undead that allows you to communicate your intentions to them on a rudimentary level. You can use Diplomacy to [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] on mindless undead and to make very simple [[Actions/Request|Requests]] of them; their mindless trait doesn't grant immunity to these mental effects. Most mindless undead are likely hostile toward you by default and must be kept at a safe distance to give you time to Make an Impression.

You become trained in Diplomacy; if already trained, you instead become trained in another skill of your choice.
