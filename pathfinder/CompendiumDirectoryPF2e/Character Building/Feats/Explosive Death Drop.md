# Explosive Death Drop `pf2:1`
## Feat 14
### [[fire]][[monk]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Blazing Talon Surge
* * *
**Requirements** You are in [[Feats/Rain of Embers Stance|Rain of Embers Stance]] and have a target [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]].

* * *

You lift your enemy into the air before bringing them crashing down with a fiery detonation. Roll an `Athletics check` check against your target's Fortitude DC. You take a -1 circumstance penalty to your check if the target is one size larger than you and a -3 circumstance penalty if it's larger than that. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your check if the target is one size smaller than you and a +3 circumstance bonus if it's smaller than that.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target takes 12d6 fire damage and falls [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] in an unoccupied adjacent square of your choice. The target is no longer grabbed. The target and any creature adjacent to it also each take 1d6 persistent fire damage.

**Success** As critical success, but the target takes 6d6 fire damage instead of 12d6, and creatures don't take persistent fire damage.

**Failure** The target is no longer grabbed.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but you fall prone.
