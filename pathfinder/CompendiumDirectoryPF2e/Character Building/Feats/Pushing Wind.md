# Pushing Wind
## Feat 8
### [[air]][[archetype]][[aura]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Fan Dancer Dedication
* * *
**Requirements** You're wielding a fan.

* * *

As you spin and glide your fans alongside your allies, you kick up a mild wind that gently carries you all forward. So long as you're holding a fan, you and allies who start their turn in a 30- foot aura emanating around you gain a +5-foot circumstance bonus to land Speed for 1 round; you also gain this bonus to your fly Speed if you possess one, but it can't grant you the ability to fly if you wouldn't otherwise be able to.

[[Feat_Feature Effects/Effect_ Pushing Wind|Effect: Pushing Wind]]

Additionally, the air impedes the movements of your foes. While holding a fan, the area in a 10-foot aura emanating around you is difficult terrain for all enemies.
