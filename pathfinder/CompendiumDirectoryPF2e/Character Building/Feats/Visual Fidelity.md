# Visual Fidelity
## Feat 6
### [[inventor]]

**Category** class; 




You've found a way to use a hodgepodge combination of devices to enhance your visual abilities in every situation. You gain darkvision and low-light vision, and you can see [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]] creatures and objects as translucent shapes, though these shapes are indistinct enough to be [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] to you.

If an effect would give you the [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] condition, the effect must attempt a counteract check against your class DC, with your counteract rank equaling half your level, rounded up. On a failed counteract check, you aren't blinded-your various devices are able to compensate.
