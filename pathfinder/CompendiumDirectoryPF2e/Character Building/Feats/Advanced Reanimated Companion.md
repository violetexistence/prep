## Feat 4
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Clockwork Reanimator Dedication
* * *
Your corpselike construct companion becomes much more powerful and can act with limited autonomy to follow your greater directives. It becomes an advanced construct companion. During an encounter, even if you don't use the Command a Minion action, your construct companion can still use 1 action on your turn that round to Stride or Strike.
