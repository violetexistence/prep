# Unfettered Halfling
## Feat 1
### [[halfling]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You were either pressed into indentured servitude or shackled in a prison, but you've since escaped and have trained to ensure you'll never be caught again. Whenever you roll a success on a check to [[Actions/Escape|Escape]] or a saving throw against an effect that would impose the [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]], [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]], or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]] condition on you, you get a critical success instead. Whenever a creature rolls a failure on a check to [[Actions/Grapple|Grapple]] you, it gets a critical failure instead.
