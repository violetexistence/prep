# Perfected Gamtu
## Feat 17
### [[goblin]][[occult]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Glorious Gamtu
* * *
Your hat embodies the illusory grandeur of a master dokkaebi. Your gamtu now grants its wearer a +1 item bonus to Stealth checks when worn, and its Hat Trick activation can grant your choice of 2nd-rank [[Spells/Invisibility|Invisibility]] or 6th-rank _invisibility_.

In addition, the gamtu can be removed while Hat Trick is activated. Doing so removes the effects of _invisibility_ from the original wearer, but the spell doesn't end. Instead, the effect continues to elapse; if another creature puts the gamtu on, they're immediately affected by _invisibility_, which lasts for the remaining duration of Hat Trick.
