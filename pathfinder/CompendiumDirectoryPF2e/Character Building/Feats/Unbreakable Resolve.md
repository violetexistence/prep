# Unbreakable Resolve `pf2:r`
## Feat 13
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[fortune]][[reincarnated]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per 10 minutes

**Trigger** You fail a Will save.

* * *

The experience of coming back after death has granted you a strong sense of resolve; devilish words, slick spells, and conniving trickery can't easily catch you off guard. Reroll the triggering save, using the second result only if it's better.
