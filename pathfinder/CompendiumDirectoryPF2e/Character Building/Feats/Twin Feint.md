# Twin Feint `pf2:2`
## Feat 1
### [[rogue]]

**Category** class; 




**Requirements** You are wielding two melee weapons, each in a different hand.

* * *

You use an attack with one weapon to distract your foe from a second attack coming at a different angle. Make one Strike with each of your two melee weapons, both against the same target. The target is automatically [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] against the second attack. Apply your multiple attack penalty to the Strikes normally.
