# Protect Ally `pf2:1`
## Feat 8
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Swordmaster Dedication
* * *
You place your body between your friends and your enemies, protecting your allies against oncoming attacks. You choose one adjacent ally. That ally gains a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn or until that ally is no longer adjacent to you, whichever comes first. You can only protect a single ally in this way. If you choose to Protect a different Ally, the previous ally loses the bonus to AC.
