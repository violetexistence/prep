## Feat 8
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Pathfinder Agent Dedication; Wayfinder Resonance Tinkerer
* * *
You are adept at using the unusual resonance of your _wayfinder_ to aid in any deceptions you might employ. Once per day you can activate your _wayfinder_ to cast [[Spells/Illusory Disguise|Illusory Disguise]], heightened to 2nd level, as an arcane spell. Additionally, once per day, you can Activate your _wayfinder_ with a single-action envision activation to transform it into a perfect replica of another similarly sized badge of membership or office, such as an Aspis Consortium badge. This transformation lasts for 1 hour.
