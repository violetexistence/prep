# Garden Path
## Feat 8
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Bellflower Dedication
* * *
You can guide your crop to move without notice. When you and any of your crop are [[Actions/Avoid Notice|Avoiding Notice]], you can choose one member of your crop to temporarily gain the benefits of the [[Feats/Quiet Allies|Quiet Allies]] skill feat until the group is no longer Avoiding Notice. The group rolls two checks instead of one, using the higher die roll. This is a fortune effect.
