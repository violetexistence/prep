# Terrifying Howl `pf2:1`
## Feat 10
### [[auditory]][[barbarian]][[rage]]

**Category** class; 




You unleash a terrifying howl. Attempt Intimidation checks to [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] each enemy within 30 feet: you don't take a penalty if the creature doesn't understand your language. Regardless of the results of your checks, each target is then temporarily immune to Terrifying Howl for 1 minute.
