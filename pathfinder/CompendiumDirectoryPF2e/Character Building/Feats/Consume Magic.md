# Consume Magic `pf2:r`
## Feat 9
### [[surki]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per hour

**Trigger** You attempt a saving throw against an area effect from the tradition matching your magiphage ability.

* * *

You consume the magic of an incoming spell or effect to protect your allies, though you might give yourself indigestion. Attempt a counteract check against the triggering effect; your counteract rank equals half your level (rounded up), and for the roll, use either your class DC â€“ 10 or your spellcasting attribute modifier plus your spellcasting proficiency bonus. If you counteract the triggering effect, you end the effect for all other creatures in the area, but you become [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] as your body struggles to absorb the influx of magic.
