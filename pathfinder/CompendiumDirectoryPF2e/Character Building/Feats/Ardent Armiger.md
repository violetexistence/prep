# Ardent Armiger
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Hellknight Armiger Dedication
* * *
**Archetype** Hellknight Armiger

* * *

You have been trained to resist the manipulations of fiends, and your Hellknight discipline makes you difficult to influence. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saves against mental effects that specifically improve your attitude and to your Will DC against someone Coercing you, Demoralizing you, Making an Impression on you, or Making a Request of you.

If a mental effect would compel you to act in a way that violates your Hellknight order's tenets (as determined by the GM), you can attempt to break free from the effect as a reaction triggered by receiving the violating order, and you gain a new Will save against the effect. You can attempt this new save only once for a given effect, even if you are compelled to violate your order's tenets multiple times.
