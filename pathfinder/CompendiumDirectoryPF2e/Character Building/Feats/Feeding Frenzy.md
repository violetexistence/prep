# Feeding Frenzy
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Werecreature Dedication; wereshark
* * *
Your serrated teeth rip and tear at your prey. When you critically hit with your jaws Strike from Werecreature Dedication, your target takes 1d4 persistent bleed damage and you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to jaws Strikes against the target until the end of your turn. If you have scent as a special sense, it's a precise sense with double its normal range when locating creatures taking persistent bleed damage.
