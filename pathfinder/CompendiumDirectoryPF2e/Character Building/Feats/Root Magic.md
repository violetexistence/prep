# Root Magic
## Feat 1
### [[general]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Occultism
* * *
Your talismans ward against foul magic. During your daily preparations, you can assemble a small pouch with bits of herbs, hair, sacred oils, and other ritual ingredients, which you give to one ally; the ally cannot be yourself. The first time that day the ally attempts a saving throw against a spell or haunt, they gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the roll. This bonus increases to +2 if you're an expert in Occultism or +3 if you're legendary.
