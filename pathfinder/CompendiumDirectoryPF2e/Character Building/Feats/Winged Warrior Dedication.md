# Winged Warrior Dedication
## Feat 2
### [[archetype]][[dedication]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** you have permanent wings (such as from an ancestry or graft)
* * *
Through rigorous training, you have strengthened your wings, granting you enough thrust to gain additional altitude. When you make a horizontal [[Actions/Leap|Leap]], increase the distance by 10 feet up to a maximum of your Speed. Any fly Speed granted by ancestry feats and other permanent wings increases by 5 feet.
