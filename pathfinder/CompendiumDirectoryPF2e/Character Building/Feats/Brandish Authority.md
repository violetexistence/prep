# Brandish Authority `pf2:2`
## Feat 18
### [[auditory]][[mythic]][[visual]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Archfiend Dedication
* * *
With a terrifying pronouncement, you manifest a visible sign of your authority and fiendish power, such as a crown of flame upon your brow, a scepter forged of solidified souls, or a throne comprised of a dozen dragon skulls. This object appears in your space or in your hand, as appropriate, and remains for 1 minute. When your sign of power appears, attempt an Intimidation check to [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] each enemy within 30 feet who can see or hear you. These Demoralize attempts don't take any penalty for not sharing a language. As long as your sign of power remains manifested, your enemies can't reduce the value of their [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened]] condition below 1.

You can spend 1 Mythic Point as part of performing this action; if you do, frightened creatures grovel before you, in awe of your terrible power. At the beginning of their turn, a creature that has the frightened condition from Brandish Authority must attempt a `Will check` saving throw against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. On failure, they must [[Actions/Drop Prone|Drop Prone]]. On a critical failure, they must Drop Prone and can't Stand this turn.
