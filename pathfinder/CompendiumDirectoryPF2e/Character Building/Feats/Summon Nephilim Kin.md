# Summon Nephilim Kin
## Feat 13
### [[nephilim]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** any nephilim lineage feat
* * *
You have a connection to the Outer Planes, allowing you to summon a divine ally. Choose either [[Spells/Summon Celestial|Summon Celestial]], [[Spells/Summon Fiend|Summon Fiend]], or another 5th-rank spell capable of summoning an extraplanar creature appropriate to your lineage. Once per day, you can cast the chosen spell as a 5th-rank divine innate spell, but the creature summoned must be from the same category as your own lineage, such as a creature with the angel trait if you are an angelkin.
