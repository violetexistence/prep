You devote much of your study to halcyon magic. You gain two common Halcyon cantrips and two common 1st-rank halcyon spells. In addition to being able to cast your halcyon spells via your arcane or primal spell slots, you also gain a 1st-rank halcyon spell slot. You can use your halcyon spell slots to spontaneously cast your halcyon spells.
