The eye rebels, the mind recoils-no matter how much those who can see you try to explain what's there, their friends' gazes just skitter over you, like a bird afraid to land. A character who attempts to Point Out your location must attempt a `DC 14 Flat check`. If they fail, their allies misunderstand them and aren't sure where you are. On a critical failure, their allies think they pointed you out in a different location entirely, chosen by the GM. Similarly, when a creature critically fails to [[Actions/Seek|Seek]] you while you're [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] to or undetected by it, it thinks you're in a different location chosen by the GM. In either case, you appear to be hidden to a creature that thinks you're in a different location, though you're actually undetected by it for targeting and further uses of the Seek action.
