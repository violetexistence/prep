# Confabulator
## Feat 2
### [[general]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** expert in Deception
* * *
Even when caught in falsehoods, you pile lie upon lie. Reduce the circumstance bonus a target gains for your previous attempts to [[Actions/Create a Diversion|Create a Diversion]] or Lie to it from +4 to +2. If you're a master in Deception, reduce the bonus to +1, and if you're legendary, your targets don't get these bonuses at all.
