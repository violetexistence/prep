# Bullseye `pf2:1`
## Feat 8
### [[rogue]]

**Category** class; 




You carefully take aim to avoid your foe's concealment and cover. On your next Strike with a thrown weapon before the end of your turn, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your attack roll and ignore your target's [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] condition, as well as the target's lesser cover or standard cover; if the target had greater cover, they instead have only standard cover against the Strike.
