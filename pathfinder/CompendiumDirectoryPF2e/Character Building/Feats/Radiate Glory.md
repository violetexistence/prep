# Radiate Glory `pf2:1`
## Feat 17
### [[divine]][[light]][[nephilim]][[visual]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Your inherent glory radiates into the world with all the divine power of the celestial planes for 1 minute.

Any creature that can see you while you Radiate Glory must attempt a `Will check` saving throw against your class or spell DC, whichever is higher. The creature then becomes temporarily immune to this effect for 24 hours.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** You are [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] to the creature for 1 round by the shining light, but can't use this concealment to [[Actions/Hide|Hide]], as normal for when your location is obvious.

**Failure** As success, except you are concealed to the creature while your glory radiates.

**Critical Failure** You are [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] to the creature while your glory radiates, lost amid the radiant corona of your presence. Your general position is still obvious, so you can't use this to [[Actions/Sneak|Sneak]].
