# Kinetic Dampening `pf2:1`
## Feat 6
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[deviant]][[magical]]

**Category** class; 




You feed off energy in your immediate surroundings, allowing you to dampen the force imparted by incoming blows. Until the beginning of your next turn, you gain resistance 5 to physical damage. At 10th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, the resistance increases by 5. Any blows that strike you during this time make no sound as their energy is drained.

**Awakening** You can extend your dampening field around you to create a safe haven for your allies. If you spend an additional action when using Kinetic Dampening, your field extends in a 15-foot emanation around you. You can choose which creatures within the emanation are affected.

**Awakening** You dampen a greater variety of wavelengths. When you use this feat, you also gain resistance to your choice of fire, electricity, or sonic damage.
