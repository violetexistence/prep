# Fling Head `pf2:1`
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]][[auditory]][[manipulate]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Headless Haunt
* * *
You Interact to remove your head, if it isn't already detached, and fling it at an enemy within 30 feet, where it emits a bone-chilling wail before dematerializing and returning to your body. Your target must attempt a `Will check` save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. You can affect one additional creature within 20 feet of your original target for each additional action you spend.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]].

**Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] and can't reduce their frightened value below 1 while they remain within 30 feet of you.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 3]].
