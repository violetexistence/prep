## Feat 6
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[arcane]][[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Pactbinder Dedication
* * *
You've sworn a pact with a dragon, giving you the ability to tap into the dragon's immeasurable power in exchange for adding to their hoard. You gain the [[Actions/Dragon Breath|Dragon Breath]] activity. In exchange, you promise to search for objects the dragon wants for its hoard upon request. These requests might be extremely specific unique objects, or they might be a broad category of objects. While the dragon agrees to pay you a fair price for the item you retrieve, the pact requires you to give your time and service.
