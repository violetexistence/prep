# Raging Athlete
## Feat 4
### [[barbarian]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** expert in Athletics
* * *
Physical obstacles can't hold back your fury. While you are raging, you gain a climb Speed and swim Speed equal to your land Speed, the DC of your [[Actions/High Jump|High Jumps]] and [[Actions/Long Jump|Long Jumps]] decreases by 10, and you increase your distance on a successful Long Jump by 10 feet. Your distance for a vertical [[Actions/Leap|Leap]] increases to 5 feet vertically, and your distance for a horizontal Leap increases to 15 feet if your Speed is at least 15 feet, and to 20 feet if your Speed is at least 30 feet.
