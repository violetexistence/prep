# Alghollthu Bound
## Feat 1
### [[azarketi]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Although you may not even be aware, the alghollthus your ancestors once served maintain a stranglehold on the deepest, tethered parts of your mind.

You receive a +2 circumstance bonus to Will saves against mental effects that would make you controlled, and if you roll a success against such an effect, you get a critical success instead.

However, you gain none of these benefits against effects originating from alghollthus and instead take a -2 circumstance penalty against mental effects from alghollthus.
