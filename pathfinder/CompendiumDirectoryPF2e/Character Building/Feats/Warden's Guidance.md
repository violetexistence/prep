# Warden's Guidance
## Feat 14
### [[ranger]]

**Category** class; 




You convey your prey's location to your allies with a series of careful words or gestures. As long as your hunted prey is observed by you, all your allies who roll failures and critical failures when [[Actions/Seek|Seeking]] it get a success instead. Your allies need to be able to see or hear you to gain this benefit. You have to be able to call out or make visible gestures for your allies to get this benefit.
