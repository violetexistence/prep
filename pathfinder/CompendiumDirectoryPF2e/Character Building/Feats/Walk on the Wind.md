**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** You've been brought to 0 Hit Points by an enemy that has the air trait or an enemy's ability that has the air trait

A flighty breeze follows you wherever you go, granting a dramatic flair to everything you do. You're light on your feet, your voice gains an airy quality that allows it to travel further than normal, and your clothing and hair rustle gently around you at all times. You can Stride at half your land Speed across calm air. If you attempt to carry another creature with you while walking on air, even if it's in an extradimensional space, you fall.
