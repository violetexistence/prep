# Slam Down `pf2:2`
## Feat 4
### [[fighter]][[flourish]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Athletics
* * *
You make an attack to knock a foe off balance, then follow up immediately with a sweep to topple them. Make a melee Strike. If it hits and deals damage, you can attempt an Athletics check to [[Actions/Trip|Trip]] the creature you hit. If you're wielding a two-handed melee weapon, you can ignore Trip's requirement that you have a hand free. Both attacks count toward your multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after you've made both of them.
