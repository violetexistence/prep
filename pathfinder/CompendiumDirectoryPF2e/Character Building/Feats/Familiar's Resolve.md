When you weave magic, your familiar traces symbols that throw off fear and doubt. If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell, you or an ally within 30 feet gain a +2 status bonus to saving throws against effects that would cause you to be doomed or frightened for 1 round. At 14th level, you or an ally gain a +3 status bonus to saving throws against these effects instead.
