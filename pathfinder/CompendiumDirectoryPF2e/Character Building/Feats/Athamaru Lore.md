# Athamaru Lore
## Feat 1
### [[athamaru]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You've immersed yourself in community learning, particularly around navigating the waters and tending to animals. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Athletics and Nature. If you automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.

You also gain the [[Feats/Additional Lore|Additional Lore]] general feat for Athamaru Lore.
