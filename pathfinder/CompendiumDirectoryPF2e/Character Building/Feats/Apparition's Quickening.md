# Apparition's Quickening `pf2:0`
## Feat 10
### [[animist]][[apparition]][[concentrate]][[spellshape]]

**Category** class; 




**Frequency** once per round

**Requirements** You are attuned to at least 2 apparitions.

* * *

If your next action is to cast a cantrip or a spell that is at least 2 ranks lower than the highest-rank spell slot you have, you can draw power from one of your attuned apparitions to reduce the number of actions to cast it by 1 (minimum 1 action). The chosen apparition is dispersed until you can re-attune to it at your next daily preparations, but you can't disperse an apparition in this way if you would no longer be attuned to any apparitions afterward.

* * *

**Special** This can only be used on a cantrip or spell from the class matching the one you gained this feat from.
