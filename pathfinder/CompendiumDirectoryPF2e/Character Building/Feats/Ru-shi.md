# Ru-shi
## Feat 1
### [[dhampir]][[lineage]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You were born to a jiang-shi, one of the so-called hopping vampires found most often in Tian-Xia. Your parent had a supernatural obsession with counting small objects, which manifests in you as a preternatural gift for linguistics and mathematics. You are trained in Society and gain the [[Feats/Eye for Numbers|Eye for Numbers]] skill feat. If you would automatically become trained in Society (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.
