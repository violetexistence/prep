# Along the Deep River
## Feat 17
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[sprite]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Access** Tian Xia origin, or you're a follower of Sangpotshi.

Once per year, when you die, you turn into an immaterial ball of light. After a week, you return to life with the effects of a successful (but not critically successful) 9th-rank [[Spells/Reincarnate|Reincarnate]] ritual. You always reincarnate into a sprite, but you _reincarnate_ as a randomly selected sprite heritage.
