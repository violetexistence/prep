# I Knew the Heroes
## Feat 18
### [[archetype]][[skill]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Uzunjati Recollection; legendary in a Recall Knowledge Skill
* * *
Your stories aren't mere tales passed down from elder to youth or teacher to student. They're the lived experiences of those you've met, and they're the stuff of legend. When you use [[Feats/Uzunjati Recollection|Uzunjati Recollection]], if you're legendary in the skill you use to Recall Knowledge, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the Recall Knowledge check, and the circumstance bonus to [[Feats/Uzunjati Storytelling|Uzunjati Storytelling]] increases to +2.
