# Thorough Reports
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** Pathfinder Agent Dedication
* * *
Your reports are thorough and informative, and putting your thoughts to paper helps you retain the information. Keep track of each type of creature you successfully identify with [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]]. When attempting Recall Knowledge checks against creatures on your list in later encounters, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus, and you learn an additional fact about such creatures on a success.
