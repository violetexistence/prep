## Feat 10
### [[archetype]][[flourish]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Winged Warrior Dedication
* * *
**Requirements** You currently have a fly Speed.

* * *

Like the fastest of predatory birds, you soar toward your prey at great speeds. Fly twice. At any point during this movement, you can make a Strike against one enemy within reach or within the first range increment of a ranged weapon. That enemy is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] against the Strike if you're attacking them from above.
