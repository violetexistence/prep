# Colugo's Traversal
## Feat 5
### [[primal]][[yaksha]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Forbidding valleys and sheer cliffs can't curb your vows to reunite the lost. You can cast your choice of [[Spells/Gentle Landing|Gentle Landing]] or [[Spells/Jump|Jump]] as a primal innate spell once per day. At 9th level, these spells are heightened to 3rd rank.
