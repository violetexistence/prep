Your core allows you to draw more power from it. Select one 1st-rank arcane spell and one 2nd-rank or lower arcane spell, to which you have access. You can cast your chosen spells as arcane innate spells each once per day.

**Enhancement** Your attunement grows stronger. Select one 5th-rank or lower arcane spell and one 6th-rank or lower arcane spell, to which you have access. You can cast them as arcane innate spells each once per day, in addition to the original spells.
