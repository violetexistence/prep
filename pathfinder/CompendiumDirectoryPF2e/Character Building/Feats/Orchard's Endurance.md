# Orchard's Endurance `pf2:1`
## Feat 14
### [[impulse]][[kineticist]][[plant]][[primal]][[stance]][[wood]]

**Category** class; 




Patches of bark appear on the skin of you and your nearby allies. You and your allies in your kinetic aura gain resistance 5 to bludgeoning and piercing damage. In addition, you and your affected allies roll flat checks to recover from persistent damage twice and take the higher result; this is a fortune effect.

**Level (+4)** The resistance increases by 2.
