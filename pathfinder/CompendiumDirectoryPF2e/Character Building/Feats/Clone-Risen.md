# Clone-Risen
## Feat 1
### [[lineage]][[reflection]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You were formed from a clone ritual or alchemical experiment. Created as a vessel for another creature, you can suppress your sentience momentarily, making your mind harder to alter. You gain the [[Actions/Empty Vessel|Empty Vessel]] reaction.
