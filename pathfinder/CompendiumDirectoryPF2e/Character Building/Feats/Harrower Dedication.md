# Harrower Dedication
## Feat 2
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[archetype]][[dedication]]

**Category** class; 




You become trained in Occultism; if you are already trained in this skill, you become trained in a different skill of your choice instead. You also become trained in Fortune-Telling Lore, and you learn the [[Spells/Harrowing|Harrowing]] ritual.

In addition, once a day when you perform your daily preparations, you can perform a harrow reading for yourself if you have access to a harrow deck. Draw a card from your harrow deckâ€”that card's suit becomes your active harrow omen for the next 24 hours and modifies several other harrower feats as detailed on the following pages. You gain the [[Actions/Avoid Dire Fate|Avoid Dire Fate]] reaction.

[[Feat_Feature Effects/Effect_ Harrow Omen|Effect: Harrow Omen]]

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the [[PF2e Journals/Archetypes/Harrower|Harrower]] archetype. If you retrain out of this feat, you lose the harrowing ritual you learned from it
