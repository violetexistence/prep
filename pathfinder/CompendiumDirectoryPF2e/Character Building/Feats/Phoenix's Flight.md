# Phoenix's Flight
## Feat 16
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Familiar Sage Dedication
* * *
**Requirements** You're adjacent to or sharing the same space as your familiar.

* * *

You and your familiar learn the secrets of elemental fire, allowing you to merge together to become a legendary creatureâ€”a phoenix. You can cast [[Spells/Monstrosity Form|Monstrosity Form]] as an innate occult spell once per day, except you can transform only into a phoenix, and your familiar must be adjacent to you before you Cast the Spell. When you Cast the Spell, your familiar merges into your form. While transformed, you gain the [[Actions/Blazing Conflagration|Blazing Conflagration]] action.
