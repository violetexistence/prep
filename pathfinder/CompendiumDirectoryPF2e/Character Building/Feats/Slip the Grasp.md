# Slip the Grasp `pf2:1`
## Feat 9
### [[fleshwarp]][[flourish]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Requirements** You are [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]], [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]], or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]].

* * *

You have some feature that allows you to quickly evade effects that restrain you. Attempt a check to Escape. If you succeed, you can Stride, Step, or make a Strike with a melee unarmed attack targeting the creature you Escaped from. If you fail, you instead attempt to Escape a second time.

You increase your multiple attack penalty as appropriate for the actions you took, but only after completing both actions.
