## Feat 2
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[archetype]][[dedication]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Charisma +2; you don't have an animal companion, construct companion, or other companion that functions similarly

You become trained in your choice of Diplomacy or Intimidation; if you are already trained in both of these skills, you become trained in a skill of your choice. You also gain your choice of the [[Feats/Group Impression|Group Impression]] or the [[Feats/Group Coercion|Group Coercion]] skill feat. If you already have both of these skill feats, you gain another 1st-level skill feat for which you qualify.

You also gain the assistance of a dedicated follower, who has agreed to accompany you on your journeys. They have the minion trait and begin as a novice follower.

**Special** Once you have a follower, you can never take a feat or class feature that grants an animal companion or another companion that prevents you from having an animal companion.
