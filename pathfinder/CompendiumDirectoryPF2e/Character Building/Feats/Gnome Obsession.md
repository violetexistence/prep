# Gnome Obsession
## Feat 1
### [[gnome]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You might have a flighty nature, but when a topic captures your attention, you dive into it headfirst. You gain the [[Feats/Additional Lore|Additional Lore]] feat and the [[Feats/Assurance|Assurance]] feat for the chosen Lore. As gnome obsessions can come and go quickly, you can retrain Gnome Obsession to a different Lore subcategory in 1 day of downtime.
