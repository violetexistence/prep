# Quick Contacts
## Feat 2
### [[general]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** expert in Society; Connections or Criminal Connections
* * *
You know where to go, who to talk to, and how to make new connections, fast. Upon entering a new settlement, spending 1 day of downtime allows you to build enough connections to make use of the [[Feats/Leverage Connections|Connections]] or [[Feats/Criminal Connections|Criminal Connections]] feats. If you're legendary in Society, you can form the required connections within 1 hour of entering a new settlement.
