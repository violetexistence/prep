# Irradiate `pf2:2`
## Feat 6
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[deviant]][[magical]][[poison]]

**Category** class; 




You exude an aura of radiation, making everyone around you ill. All creatures in a 15-foot emanation must succeed at a `Fortitude check` save or become [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]]. On a critical failure, they're also [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]] for 1 minute. You're immune to your own radiation. The value of this sickened condition increases by 1 for every 5 levels you have beyond 6th.

**Awakening** You become more efficient at exuding this aura of radiation. The radius of the emanation becomes 60 feet.

**Awakening** Your radiation becomes more potent. Creatures in the area take an additional 1d4 poison damage for every 2 levels you have, with a `Fortitude check` save (roll this Fortitude save once and apply it to both the damage and the sickened condition).
