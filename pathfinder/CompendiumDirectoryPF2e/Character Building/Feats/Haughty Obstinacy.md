# Haughty Obstinacy
## Feat 1
### [[human]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Your powerful ego makes it harder for others to order you around. If you roll a success on a saving throw against a mental effect that attempts to directly control your actions, you critically succeed instead. If a creature rolls a failure on a check to [[Actions/Coerce|Coerce]] you using Intimidation, it gets a critical failure instead (so it can't try to Coerce you again for 1 week).
