# Wandering Chef Dedication
## Feat 2
### [[archetype]][[dedication]]

**Category** class; 




Whether trained in a noble kitchen or a humble home, you know how to cook delicious dishes and source ingredients from the wilderness or urban settings. You become trained in Crafting; if you were already trained in Crafting, you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You can use cookware instead of an alchemist's toolkit to craft alchemical foods. When using the [[Actions/Subsist|Subsist]] downtime activity, you can use Crafting or Cooking Lore in place of Survival, and if you roll a failure, you get a success instead.

You gain the [[PF2e Journals/Archetypes/Quick Alchemy benefits|Quick Alchemy benefits]], but can use it only to create consumables, and the consumables must be alchemical food. Any items you choose with [[Feats/Alchemical Crafting|Alchemical Crafting]] must be alchemical food, but they can be 1st level or 2nd level instead of only 1st level.

You create up to 4 versatile vials during your daily preparations. Typically, a wandering chef's versatile vials take the form of parcels of foraged ingredients.
