# Group Coercion
## Feat 1
### [[general]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Intimidation
* * *
You can strong-arm people effectively, even when you don't have them isolated. When you [[Actions/Coerce|Coerce]], you can compare your Intimidation check result to the Will DCs of up to five targets instead of one.

It's possible to get a different degree of success for each target. The number of targets you can Coerce in a single action increases to 10 if you're an expert, 25 if you're a master, and 50 if you're legendary.
