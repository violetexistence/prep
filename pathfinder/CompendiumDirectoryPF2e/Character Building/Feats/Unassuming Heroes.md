You have a talent for making friends through simple kindness, often among stray animals or other creatures that people tend to overlook, and your inherent magic can make these acts take on additional power. As an Interact action, you can feed a small treat, such as a millet dumpling, to an animal that has an indifferent or better attitude toward you. For the next 1 minute, one of the animal's unarmed attacks becomes a _+1 striking_ unarmed attack. If it was already a _+1 striking_ attack, it instead gains the effects of the _ghost touch_ rune.
