# Sun's Fury
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Bright Lion Dedication
* * *
The Old Sun Gods have granted you a gift in your fight against Walkena. You gain the [[Spells/Sun's Fury|Sun's Fury]] focus spell. If you don't already have one, you gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point, which you can regain using the Refocus activity to pray to the Old Sun Gods; if you already have a focus pool, increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1. Your Bright Lion focus spells are divine spells; when you gain this feat, if you aren't already, you become trained in divine spell attacks and spell DCs, using Charisma as your spellcasting ability score.
