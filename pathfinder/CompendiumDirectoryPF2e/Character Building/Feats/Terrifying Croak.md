# Terrifying Croak `pf2:1`
## Feat 1
### [[grippli]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Intimidation
* * *
You release a haunting croak that reminds those around you of their fears. Attempt an Intimidation check to [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] a creature within 30 feet; you do not take a penalty to this check for not speaking a language. If the check is successful, the target cannot reduce their frightened condition below 1 for 1 round.
