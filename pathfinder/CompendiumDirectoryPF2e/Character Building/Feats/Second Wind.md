# Second Wind
## Feat 2
### [[barbarian]]

**Category** class; 




You can enter a second rage, but afterward you need to catch your breath. When you [[Actions/Rage|Rage]], you can choose to gain temporary HP from the Rage even if 1 minute hasn't passed (or a full turn if you have the [[Class Features/Revitalizing Rage|Revitalizing Rage]] class feature). If you do, once this Rage ends you become [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]] until you rest for 10 minutes.
