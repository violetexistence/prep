# Abjure Harm `pf2:r`
## Feat 16
### [[mythic]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Ascended Celestial Dedication
* * *
**Trigger** You would take damage from an enemy's critical Strike.

* * *

You're nigh invincible, and it's clear that your foe is so far beneath you that they have no hope of winning. Spend 1 Mythic Point. The triggering Strike becomes a regular hit instead of a critical hit and you gain resistance to physical damage equal to your level until the beginning of your next turn. During your next turn, if you attempt a [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] check against the triggering creature, you do so at mythic proficiency.
