# Fade Away
## Feat 9
### [[halfling]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Easily Dismissed
* * *
Your ability to blend into the background allows you to fade away entirely or appear innocuous even to magical effects. You gain [[Spells/Invisibility|Invisibility]] and [[Spells/Disguise Magic|Disguise Magic]] as 2nd-rank innate occult spells. You can target only yourself with _invisibility_, and you must be the primary target of _disguise magic_. You can cast each spell once per day.
