## Feat 1
### [[jotunborn]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You gain access to all uncommon weapons with the jotunborn trait. You have familiarity with weapons with the jotunborn trait plus the bola, greataxe, halberd, maul, longspear, and war flailâ€”for the purpose of proficiency, you treat any of these that are martial weapons as simple weapons and any that are advanced weapons as martial weapons.
