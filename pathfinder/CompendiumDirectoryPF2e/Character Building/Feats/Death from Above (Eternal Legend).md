# Death from Above (Eternal Legend) `pf2:2`
## Feat 16
### [[mythic]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Eternal Legend Dedication
* * *
**Requirements** You are adjacent to a climbable surface at least 10 feet tall.

* * *

Seemingly to defy gravity, you use a nearby vertical surface to propel yourself upward and then strike downward like the driving rain. Stride up to half your Speed upward on the required surface; if you have a climb Speed, you may use your full climb Speed instead. The surface does not need to span the full height of your Stride. You can then either make a ranged Strike at a target within your weapon's first range increment and land in the space you began (or an adjacent space) without taking falling damage, or you can land in a space adjacent to a creature within 10 feet of the required surface without taking falling damage and make a melee Strike against that creature. Either Strike deals an extra two dice of weapon damage. In addition, the target dealt damage by your Strike must succeed at a `Fortitude check` saving throw against your class DC or become [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]].
