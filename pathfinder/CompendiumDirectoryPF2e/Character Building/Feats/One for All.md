# One for All `pf2:1`
## Feat 1
### [[auditory]][[concentrate]][[emotion]][[linguistic]][[mental]][[swashbuckler]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Diplomacy

With precisely the right words of encouragement, you bolster an ally's efforts. Designate an ally within 30 feet; this action counts as sufficient preparation to [[Actions/Aid|Aid]] that ally. When you use the Aid reaction to help that ally, you can roll `Diplomacy check` in place of the usual check and the action gains the bravado trait
