# Sense the Strike `pf2:r`
## Feat 10
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Verduran Shadow Dedication; master in Survival
* * *
**Trigger** A creature targets you with an attack and you can see the attacker.

* * *

You sense how an incoming attack moves through ambient primal energy, predicting how best to dodge. The triggering attack targets your Survival DC instead of your AC. Though this allows you to avoid taking penalties to your AC, it doesn't remove any conditions or other effects causing such penalties. For example, an enemy with sneak attack would still deal extra damage to you for being [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]], even though you wouldn't take the â€“2 circumstance penalty when defending against the attack.
