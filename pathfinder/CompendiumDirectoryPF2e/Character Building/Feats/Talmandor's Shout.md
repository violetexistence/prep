# Talmandor's Shout `pf2:2`
## Feat 12
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Eagle Knight Dedication; master in Intimidation
* * *
**Frequency** once per day

**Requirements** You witnessed a creature deal damage to an ally within 30 feet since your last turn.

* * *

After seeing an enemy harm one of your allies, you deliver a righteous shout in the name of the celestial Talmandor. Attempt an Intimidation check to [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]], comparing the result to the Will DC of each enemy within a 60-foot emanation; this Demoralize attempt doesn't take any penalty for not sharing a language. It's possible to get a different degree of success for each target.
