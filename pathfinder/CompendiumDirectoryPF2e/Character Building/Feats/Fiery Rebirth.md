# Fiery Rebirth `pf2:0`
## Feat 4
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[fire]][[healing]][[mythic]]

**Category** class; 




**Trigger** You regain Hit Points while you are [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]].

* * *

When you escape death, you return to life with retributive fire that burns those who harmed you. You expend 1 Mythic Point, return to consciousness, Stand, and regain additional Hit Points equal to your level. You then erupt in flames, dealing fire damage equal to twice your level (2 fire) to adjacent foes, with a `Reflex check` save against your class DC. Foes that critically fail the save are also pushed 5 feet away from you.
