# Witchwood Seed `pf2:2`
## Feat 12
### [[impulse]][[kineticist]][[overflow]][[plant]][[polymorph]][[primal]][[wood]]

**Category** class; 




You touch a creature to implant a malignant seed in its body. The creature takes 2d10 piercing damage and other effects depending on its `Fortitude check` save against your class DC. The creature is then temporarily immune for 24 hours. Creatures with the fungus, plant, or wood trait are immune.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature takes half damage and takes a -10-foot status penalty to all its Speeds until the end of its next turn.

**Failure** The target takes full damage and is [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 2]] and [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] until the end of its next turn.

**Critical Failure** The target takes double damage and is clumsy 2 and immobilized. It attempts a new save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect if it succeeds.

* * *

**Level (+4)** The damage increases by 1d10.
