You ask questions you know will be answered. Ask a question of a non-allied creature that you can see and have been conversing with. Attempt an Intimidation check against the creature's Will DC; if the creature is a member of the same religion as you, or is an undead or werecreature pretending to be a member of your faith, you get a +2 circumstance bonus on this check. The creature is then temporarily immune for 1 hour.
