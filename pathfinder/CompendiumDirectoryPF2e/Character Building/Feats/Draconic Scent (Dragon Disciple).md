## Feat 4
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Dragon Disciple Dedication
* * *
Your sense of smell is uncanny, much like a dragon's. You gain imprecise scent with a range of 30 feet. The GM might double the range if you're downwind from the creature or halve the range if you're upwind, at their discretion.
