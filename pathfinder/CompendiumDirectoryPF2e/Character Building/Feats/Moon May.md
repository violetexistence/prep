# Moon May
## Feat 1
### [[changeling]][[lineage]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Your mother was a moon hag, a handmaiden of Groetus, and you have a single scarlet eye and a sliver of her supernal foresight. You can cast [[Spells/Guidance|Guidance]] as an occult innate cantrip. A cantrip is heightened to a spell rank equal to half your level rounded up.
