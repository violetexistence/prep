# Desperate Resuscitation `pf2:3`
## Feat 14
### [[commander]][[healing]][[manipulate]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** master in Medicine; Officer's Medical Training
* * *
**Requirements** You are holding a healer's toolkit or are wearing one and have a free hand; the target's body is mostly intact; the target was not killed by a death effect.

* * *

You can use your training in combat medicine to revive the recently deceased. Attempt a `DC 40 Medicine check` check to revive a dead creature that has been dead for no more than 3 rounds. If you succeed, the target returns to life with the effects of raise dead, except it still has the wounded condition it had before dying, increased by 1 (or [[Conditions/Wounded|Wounded 1]] if it wasn't wounded before dying). Whether you succeed or fail, the target is temporarily immune to Desperate Resuscitation for 1 day.
