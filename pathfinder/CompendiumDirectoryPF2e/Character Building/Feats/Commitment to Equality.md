# Commitment to Equality `pf2:2`
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]][[auditory]][[mental]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** Eagle Knight Dedication; expert in Diplomacy
* * *
You help an ally shake off any impediment that would give an enemy an unfair advantage. You rally a creature within 30 feet in an attempt to reduce its [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened]] or [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied]] condition. If a creature has multiple conditions from this list, choose one. When you're a master in Diplomacy, add [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy]] and [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled]] to the list of conditions. When you're legendary in Diplomacy, add [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned]] to the list of conditions; if the stunned condition has a duration instead of a value, you can't use Commitment to Equality to reduce it.

Attempt a `Diplomacy check` check against the saving throw DC of the effect that caused the condition; if there was no saving throw DC, use the hard DC for the level of the creature, hazard, or item that caused the effect. You can't treat a condition that came from an artifact or effect above 20th level unless you're legendary in Diplomacy; even if you can, the counteract DC increases by 10. You can't treat a condition that is part of a curse or disease or is a natural state of the target. Once you attempt to treat a target's condition, that target is immune to further attempts for 1 hour, regardless of the result.

* * *

**Critical Success** Reduce the condition's value by 2.

**Success** Reduce the condition's value by 1.

**Critical Failure** Increase the condition's value by 1.
