# Extraplanar Cloud
## Feat 9
### [[nephilim]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Extraplanar Haze
* * *
When you use Extraplanar Haze, you can spend 1 additional action to disperse the particles as a 10-foot emanation cloud centered on you instead of as a haze; the activity gains the concentrate trait. All creatures within the cloud become [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]], and all creatures outside the cloud become concealed to creatures within it.
