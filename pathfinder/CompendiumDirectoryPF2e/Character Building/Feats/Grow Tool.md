# Grow Tool `pf2:3`
## Feat 9
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[plant]][[primal]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** ardande trait, plant trait, or wood trait
* * *
You grow a simple tool from your own body, coaxing flowers, vines, roots, and wood to grow and sprout from your flesh into the desired shape. You create a one level 0 common simple tool with no intricate parts or written text, such as a crowbar, rope, or shovel. You can't replicate a tool kit or weapon with this ability. This item lasts for 1 minute, or until you create another tool with this ability, whichever comes first. When duration runs out, the item crumbles to mulch.

**Special** This feat gains the trait for your ancestry.
