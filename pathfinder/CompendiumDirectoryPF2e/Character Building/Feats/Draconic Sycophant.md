# Draconic Sycophant
## Feat 1
### [[kobold]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You have an affect that dragonkind find unusually pleasingâ€”and when that fails, you know when to duck. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks and saving throws against dragons.

In addition, whenever you meet a creature with the dragon trait in a social situation, you can attempt a Diplomacy check to [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] on that creature immediately, rather than after conversing for 1 minute; you take a -5 penalty to this check. If you fail, you can choose to engage in 1 minute of conversation and then attempt a new check rather than accept the failure or critical failure result.

**Special** If you have the [[Feats/Glad-Hand|Glad-Hand]] skill feat, you don't take the penalty to your immediate Diplomacy check if the target has the dragon trait.
