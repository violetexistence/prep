* * *
After a lifetime of using temporary, ghostly limbs to manipulate objects, you hardly need real hands. You can extend your limbs to perform simple Interact actions at a range 5 feet beyond your normal range, after which your limbs contract back to their normal length. You can also cast the [[Spells/Telekinetic Hand|Telekinetic Hand]] cantrip as an arcane or occult innate spell at will, which always takes the ghostlike form of _telekinetic hand_ and is tethered to your body via a snaking, illusory arm. A cantrip is heightened to a spell rank equal to half your level rounded up.
