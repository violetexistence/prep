# Become Thought
## Feat 20
### [[psychic]]

**Category** class; 




You shed some of your material form, becoming a being of pure thought. This has the following effects.

*   You gain resistance 10 to physical damage but weakness 5 to mental damage and weakness 10 to any effect that deals damage by targeting the spirit, such as [[Spells/Spirit Blast|Spirit Blast]].
*   You can change your appearance on a whim. This takes a single action, which has the concentrate trait, has the effects of [[Spells/Illusory Disguise|Illusory Disguise]], and lasts until you change your appearance again.
*   Once per year, when you die, you automatically return to life the next day as long as one living sentient creature on your plane remembers you; the memories enable you to reconstruct yourself from their thoughts. You appear in the vicinity of the creature that remembers you most strongly.
