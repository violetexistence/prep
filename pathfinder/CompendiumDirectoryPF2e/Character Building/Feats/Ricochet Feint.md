# Ricochet Feint
## Feat 12
### [[rogue]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Ricochet Stance

While in [[Feats/Ricochet Stance (Rogue)|Ricochet Stance]], you can bounce a thrown weapon off a foe to distract them. You can attempt a [[Actions/Feint|Feint]] against a creature within the first range increment of a thrown weapon you are wielding, rather than only creatures within your melee reach.
