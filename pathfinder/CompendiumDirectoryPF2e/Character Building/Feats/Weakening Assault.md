## Feat 12
### [[guardian]]

**Category** class; 




With a barrage of blows, you diminish an enemy's strength. Strike an enemy affected by your [[Actions/Taunt|Taunt]] twice. If either Strike hits, the target is [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]] until the beginning of your next turn. If both Strikes hit, the target is [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 3]] instead.
