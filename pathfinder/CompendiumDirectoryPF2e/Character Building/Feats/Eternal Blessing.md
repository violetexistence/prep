**Prerequisites** holy
* * *
Your deeds have brought your deity's grace to you for all of eternity. You're continuously surrounded by a [[Spells/Bless|Bless]] spell, with a spell rank equal to half your level (rounded up). The radius is 15 feet, and you can't increase it. You can Dismiss the spell; if you do, it returns automatically after 1 minute.
