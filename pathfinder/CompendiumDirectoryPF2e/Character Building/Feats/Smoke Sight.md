# Smoke Sight
## Feat 9
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[dwarf]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Access** You are from Dongun Hold or Alkenstar.

* * *

You're used to fighting and hiding in a haze of smoke and flame. You automatically succeed at the `DC 5 Flat check` to target a [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] creature if that creature is concealed only by smoke. When you are concealed or [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] in smoke, increase the DC of the flat check to target you to 6 if you're concealed or 12 if you're hidden.
