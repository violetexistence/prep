# Green Tongue
## Feat 12
### [[druid]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Green Empathy
* * *
You share a special kinship with all things green and living. You (and your leshy familiar, if you have one) are constantly under the effects of [[Spells/Speak with Plants|Speak with Plants]]. Most non-creature plants recognize you as a druid of the leaf order and are friendly to you.
