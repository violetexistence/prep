# Into the Labyrinth
## Feat 17
### [[minotaur]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Calling on your connection to minotaurs of myth, you shunt an enemy into a complex maze full of puzzles of your own devising. Once per day, you can cast [[Spells/Quandary|Quandary]] as an 8th-rank occult innate spell, which takes the form of a labyrinth instead of a puzzle room. Targets cannot attempt to use Occultism to escape the spell (as normal for _quandary_), but they can use Survival to find their way through the labyrinth's corridors.
