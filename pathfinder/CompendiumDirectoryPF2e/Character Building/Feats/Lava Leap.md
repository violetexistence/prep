# Lava Leap `pf2:2`
## Feat 4
### [[composite]][[earth]][[fire]][[impulse]][[kineticist]][[overflow]][[primal]]

**Category** class; 




You wreath yourself in molten stone and hurtle toward your enemy. [[Actions/Leap|Leap]] up to your Speed. At the end of your Leap, a wave of lava crashes onto all creatures in a 10-foot emanation. Each creature in the area takes 0d6 bludgeoning + 1d6 fire damage, with a `Reflex check` save against your class DC.

The cooling remains of the lava form a temporary protective shell around you, granting you a +2 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn.

**Level (+3)** Each type of damage increases by 1d6.
