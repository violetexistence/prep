## Feat 9
### [[duskwalker]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Your connection to the Boneyard empowers you to bring death to all forms of life and unlife, exploiting their weaknesses. All your weapon and unarmed Strikes are magical and deal 1 additional void damage to living creatures and 1 additional vitality damage to undead. The extra damage increases to 2 if the Strike has a _+3 potency rune_.
