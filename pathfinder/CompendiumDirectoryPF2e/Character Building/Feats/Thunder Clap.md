# Thunder Clap `pf2:2`
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]][[sonic]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Powder Punch Stance
* * *
You slam your hands together to unleash a deafening blast. Creatures in a 15-foot cone cone take 3d6 sonic damage, with a `Fortitude check` against your class DC. Creatures that critically fail their save are also [[Conditions/Deafened|Deafened]] for 1 minute. You can't use this ability again for 1d4 rounds as your hands recover from the thunderous vibrations.

At 8th level, and every 2 levels thereafter, the damage from Thunder Clap increases by 1d6.
