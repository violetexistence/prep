# Bloody Denial `pf2:2`
## Feat 14
### [[flourish]][[guardian]]

**Category** class; 




You strike a foe with force to prevent them from reacting. Make a Strike. If you hit, the target must attempt a `Fortitude check` saving throw against your class DC. If your Strike was a critical hit, the result of the save is one degree of success worse.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** Choose an ally. Until the start of your next turn, the creature can't use reactions against that ally.

**Failure** The creature can't use reactions until the start of your next turn.

**Critical Failure** As failure, plus the creature is [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]].
