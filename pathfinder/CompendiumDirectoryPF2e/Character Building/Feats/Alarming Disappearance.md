# Alarming Disappearance
## Feat 5
### [[minotaur]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** expert in Stealth
* * *
Your ability to move unseen is startling for one your size, causing panic among your enemies. When you successfully [[Actions/Hide|Hide]] when previously observed, creatures you are [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] from become [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]]. They are then temporarily immune to Alarming Disappearance for 1 hour. Typically, creatures that have traveled with you for a significant time, such as your fellow party members, are immune to your Alarming Disappearance.
