## Feat 20
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[archetype]][[death]][[divine]][[flourish]][[mental]][[occult]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Secret Eater
* * *
**Frequency** Once per day

* * *

The ravenous maggots inside you become capable of exploding forth from your attacks into the wounds of an opponent, whispering telepathic words of destruction that invoke horrific flashbacks of Kabriri's transformation from elf to ghoul or psychic images of hundreds of maggots bursting from the victim's flesh all at once. Make a melee Strike against a target creature. If it hits, in addition to taking damage from the Strike, the target is affected by a 10th-rank casting of [[Spells/Power Word Kill|Power Word Kill]]. If Wrath of the First Ghoul is used against a target elf, Leng ghoul, or worshipper of Pharasma and does not instantly kill the creature, the target takes double damage.
