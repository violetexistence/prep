You know how to keep others alive in the Gravelands' murkiest shadows. Allies within 10 feet of you gain the benefit of [[Feats/Survivor of Desolation|Survivor of Desolation]]. If you are a champion, this aura is a champion aura, even though you gained it from Knight Reclaimant instead of a champion feat or feature.
