You learn dream-related magic to aid your studies. Choose [[Spells/Dream Message|Dream Message]] or [[Spells/Sleep|Sleep]] upon taking this feat; you learn this spell as a 4th-rank innate occult spell. If you choose sleep, you can cast the spell only while in a Daydream Trance. You become trained in occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs, and your spellcasting ability for these spells is Wisdom.
