# Ancestral Mind
## Feat 1
### [[psychic]]

**Category** class; 




By unraveling memories and connections passed down from your progenitors and buried within your unconscious mind, you learn to convert your inherent magic into psychic power. You can cast any innate spells you know from an ancestry feat or heritage using your psychic spellcasting components. When you do so, the spell's tradition becomes occult, if it wasn't already, and you can use your psychic spellcasting ability modifier instead of Charisma to determine your spell attack roll and spell DC.
