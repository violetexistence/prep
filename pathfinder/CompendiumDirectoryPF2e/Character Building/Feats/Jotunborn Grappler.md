# Jotunborn Grappler
## Feat 1
### [[jotunborn]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Wrestling is a common pastime for jotunborn, and you've done your fair share. You are trained in Athletics. If you would automatically become trained in Athletics (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also gain the [[Feats/Titan Wrestler|Titan Wrestler]] skill feat.
