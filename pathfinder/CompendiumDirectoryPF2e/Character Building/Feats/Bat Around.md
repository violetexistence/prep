## Feat 16
### [[mythic]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Beast Lord Dedication
* * *
Your attack moves a foe into a position that your united companion can take full advantage of. Make a melee Strike against an enemy. As long as your Strike deals damage, you can attempt an Athletics check to either [[Actions/Reposition|Reposition]] or [[Actions/Shove|Shove]] the creature you hit. Both attacks count toward your multiple attack penalty, but it doesn't increase until after you've made both attacks. If your Reposition or Shove moves the target and it ends this movement within your united companion's reach, your companion can Strike the target. Unless it critically fails, your companion can also attempt an Athletics check to Reposition or Shove the creature. These attacks affect your united companion's multiple attack penalty the same way.
