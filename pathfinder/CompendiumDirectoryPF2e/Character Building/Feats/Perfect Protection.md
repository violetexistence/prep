# Perfect Protection
## Feat 18
### [[guardian]]

**Category** class; 




Your armor protects you from the deadliest hits. Each time you're critically hit while wearing the medium or heavy armor, attempt a `DC 14 Flat check`. On a success, it becomes a normal hit.

* * *

**Special** If your armor has a [[Equipment/Fortification|Fortification]] rune, you roll only one flat check, but the DC is 12 (or 10 if it's a [[Equipment/Fortification (Greater)|Greater Fortification]] rune).
