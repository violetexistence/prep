# Communal Healing
## Feat 2
### [[cleric]][[healing]][[vitality]]

**Category** class; 




You're an exceptional conduit for vitality and, as you channel it through you, you can divert some to heal yourself or another creature. When you cast the [[Spells/Heal|Heal]] spell to heal a single creature, choose another willing living creature within range of your _heal_ to regain Hit Points equal to the _heal_ spell's rank.
