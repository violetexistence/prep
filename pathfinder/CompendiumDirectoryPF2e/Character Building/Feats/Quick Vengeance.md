**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Intercept Attack or Shield Block
* * *
Indignant at any who would strike you or your allies, you get your revenge. When you use [[Actions/Intercept Attack|Intercept Attack]] or [[Feats/Shield Block|Shield Block]], you are [[Conditions/Quickened|Quickened]] on your next turn. You can use the extra action only to Stride closer to the enemy whose attack triggered that reaction or to Strike that enemy.
