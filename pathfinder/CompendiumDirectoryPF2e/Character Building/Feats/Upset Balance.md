# Upset Balance `pf2:r`
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** stalwart defender dedication; expert in Athletics
* * *
**Trigger** You are damaged by a melee Strike.

**Requirements** You are in Tenacious Stance.

* * *

You lean into your foe's attack, using the weight of your body and armor to send them reeling. Attempt an `Athletics check` check against the creature's Reflex DC. On a success, the target becomes [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] until the end of its next turn ([[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 2]] on a critical success). If you are anchored, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to this check.
