**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Secret Eater

**Frequency** Once per hour

* * *

You have uncovered occult mysteries that allow you to unleash the devastating hunger of Kabriri upon your foes with a single exhalation, releasing a massive cloud of flesh-eating gas that glows with a sickly green light. You deal 7d6 acid and 7d6 void damage to all creatures within a 30-foot cone (`Reflex check` save with a DC equal to your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher). A creature that gets a critical failure on this Reflex save is also [[Conditions/Paralyzed|Paralyzed]] for 1 round. A creature that succeeds at this save becomes temporarily immune to Breath of Hungry Death for 24 hours.

When a creature is killed using Breath of Hungry Death, its body is reduced to a smoldering pile of ash wafting with necrotic fumes. You can use a reaction to immediately inhale these fumes and become satiated or fully satiated as if you had used Consume Flesh.
