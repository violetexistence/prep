You've learned to communicate with creatures from all over the world, overcoming language barriers to lend a hand and help where you're needed. You're affected by a constant [[Spells/Truespeech|Truespeech]] spell.

When you attempt a Diplomacy check to [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] or [[Actions/Request|Request]], you can spend 1 Mythic Point to make the check at mythic proficiency.
