# Follow-Up Strike `pf2:1`
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]][[flourish]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Martial Artist Dedication
* * *
**Requirements** Your last action was a missed Strike with a melee unarmed attack.

* * *

You have trained rigorously to use all parts of your body as a weapon, and when you miss with an attack, you can usually continue the attack with a different body part and still deal damage. Make another Strike with a melee unarmed attack, using the same multiple attack penalty as the missed Strike, if any.
