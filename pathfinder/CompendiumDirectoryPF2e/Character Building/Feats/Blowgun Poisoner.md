# Blowgun Poisoner
## Feat 1
### [[alchemist]]

**Category** class; 




You can capably deliver toxins with a [[Equipment/Blowgun|Blowgun]]. Your blowgun [[Actions/Strike|Strikes]] can apply injury poisons even if they deal no damage due to a creature's resistance. If you critically succeed at a blowgun Strike using a poisoned dart, the target's initial save against the poison is one degree of success worse than the creature rolls; this is a misfortune effect.

In addition, if you make a blowgun Strike while [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] or [[Conditions/Undetected|Undetected]], you don't automatically become [[Conditions/Observed|Observed]]. Instead, immediately attempt a `Stealth check` check against the Perception DC of the target. If you succeed, you don't become observed, and are hidden (if you were undetected, you still become hidden rather than remaining undetected).
