# Torrential Backlash `pf2:2`
## Feat 10
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Curse Maelstrom Dedication
* * *
**Requirements** You are in a curse maelstrom state.

* * *

Calling upon forbidden practices, you release the curse from within yourself, allowing it free rein to destroy everything around you. All creatures within your curse maelstrom emanation except you take 1d6 void damage for each level you have, with a `Fortitude check` save. Your curse maelstrom state then ends.
