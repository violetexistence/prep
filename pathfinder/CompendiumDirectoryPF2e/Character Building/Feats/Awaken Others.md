# Awaken Others
## Feat 13
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[awakened-animal]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** master in Nature
* * *
You can awaken others just through contact and communication. You learn the [[Spells/Awaken Animal|Awaken Animal]] ritual. You use your own nature to supplement the ritual, so it costs 1/10 the value on the Creature Creation Rituals table instead of 1/5. If you would get a critical failure on the check, you instead get a failure.
