# Mage's Field Dressing `pf2:1`
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** War Mage Dedication; Battle Medicine
* * *
**Requirements** Your previous action was to Cast a Spell from a wizard spell slot, and the spell affected an ally within 60 feet.

* * *

As your spell takes hold on your ally, you use some of its magic to quickly dress their wounds. You use [[Feats/Battle Medicine|Battle Medicine]] on one ally affected by the required spell. You do not need to be holding or wearing a [[Equipment/Healer's Toolkit|Healer's Toolkit]], as you conjure glowing threads, bandages, or similar supplies out of pure magic, which adds the arcane trait to Battle Medicine.
