# Instrument of Slaughter
## Feat 16
### [[champion]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** champion's reaction that grants extra damage with your Strikes (including the desecration, iniquity, and obedience causes)
* * *
Your blessed armament thirsts for the blood of your foes. Whenever you critically hit an enemy with a Strike that has the extra damage from your champion's reaction, the target also takes persistent bleed damage equal to two of the weapon's damage dice.
