Your eidolon gains more magic. Choose one 2nd-rank spell and one 1st-rank spell of your eidolon's tradition. Your eidolon can cast them each once per day as innate spells. At every even level after you take this feat, your eidolon can swap one of these innate spells for a new innate spell that's 2 or more levels lower than your highest-rank spell slot.
