# Acrobatic Performer
## Feat 1
### [[general]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Acrobatics
* * *
You're an incredible acrobat, evoking wonder and enrapturing audiences with your prowess. You can roll an [[Actions/perform skill=acrobatics variant=dance|perform skill=acrobatics variant=dance]]{Acrobatics} check instead of a Performance check when using the [[Actions/Perform|Perform]] action. If you are trained in both Acrobatics and Performance, you gain a +1 circumstances bonus on Acrobatics checks made to Perform.
