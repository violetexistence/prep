Identifying a creature is the first step in finding its weaknesses. Attempt a Strike against the target; if successful, you deal an additional 1d6 precision damage. If you have succeeded on a Recall Knowledge check against the target during this combat and their creature type was previously recorded using [[Feats/Thorough Reports|Thorough Reports]], you also deal 1 point of persistent bleed damage. The creature is then temporarily immune to Discerning Strike for 1 day.
