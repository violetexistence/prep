# Swordlord Exile
## Feat 20
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Aldori Duelist Dedication; you have broken or forsaken the Aldori swordpact
* * *
You are a swordlord exile. You have abandoned or been abandoned by the Aldori Academy. Aldori swordlords are honor-bound to challenge you on sight. Additionally, your unbridled skill strikes terror in those around you. You can use Dueling Lore instead of Intimidation to [[Actions/coerce skill=dueling-lore|coerce skill=dueling-lore]]{Coerce} and [[Actions/demoralize skill=dueling-lore|demoralize skill=dueling-lore]]{Demoralize} while your [[Equipment/Aldori Dueling Sword|Aldori Dueling Sword]] is visible to the target of your attempt.

With broken pride, your blade is now a disgraced tool used to remove obstacles between you and your goals, whatever they may be. The first time you hit a creature with an Aldori dueling sword each round, you deal 5 additional precision damage.

* * *

**Special** You can't take both this feat and [[Feats/Aldori Swordlord|Aldori Swordlord]].
