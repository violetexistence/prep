# Scar-Thick Skin
## Feat 5
### [[orc]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Glorious, storied scars cover and protect much of your body, girding you in fleshly armor that resists any wound weaker than those you have already survived. Your DC on flat checks to end persistent bleed damage is reduced from 15 to 10, or from 10 to a `DC 5 Flat check` after receiving especially appropriate assistance.
