You can make your skin take on the woody endurance of an ancient tree and have your familiar follow suit. You can cast [[Spells/Oaken Resilience|Oaken Resilience]] at will as an innate primal spell with a spell rank one lower than the highest rank of spells you can cast. This spell targets you, as well as your leshy familiar if it's within 30 feet of you.
