# Reassuring Presence `pf2:r`
## Feat 1
### [[anadi]][[auditory]][[visual]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Trigger** An ally within 30 feet gains the [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened]] condition.

* * *

You serve as an anchor to your close companions, calming them in times of stress. Decrease the value of the triggering ally's frightened condition by 1. The ally is then temporarily immune to your Reassuring Presence for 1 hour.
