### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[archetype]][[druid]][[wizard]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Druid Dedication or Wizard Dedication

Your mask carries the legacy of Verdant Spider, the Speaker of Needs, allowing you to deceive and outwit your foes. You can attempt to [[Actions/Feint|Feint]] a target from up to 30 feet away, and if you succeed or critically succeed in your Feint attempt, the target of your Feint takes a -2 circumstance penalty to saving throws against your spells until the start of your next turn. If you don't have the [[Feats/Conceal Spell|Conceal Spell]] feat, you gain it as a bonus feat, allowing you to disguise your spellcasting from others' eyes. If you already have the Conceal Spell feat, you can use Conceal Spell once per round as a free action instead of as a single action.
