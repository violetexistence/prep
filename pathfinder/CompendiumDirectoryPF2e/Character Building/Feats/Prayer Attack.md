# Prayer Attack `pf2:1`
## Feat 14
### [[archetype]][[concentrate]]

**Category** class; 




**Requirements** You are wielding a sawtooth saber in each hand.

* * *

You've mastered the signature assassination style of the Red Mantis. Attempt to [[Actions/Feint|Feint]] an enemy within 30 feet. If your Feint is successful, when you use Prayer Attack on subsequent turns you automatically make the target [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] against your melee attacks for that turn without rolling a check to Feint, so long as you remain visible to the target and the target remains within 30 feet of you. If you use your Prayer Attack against a different target, you must attempt to Feint the target normally.

When you use Prayer Attack, your next successful Strike with a sawtooth saber that turn deals 2d6 persistent bleed damage to the target.
