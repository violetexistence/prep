# Encouraging Words `pf2:1`
## Feat 2
### [[auditory]][[general]][[linguistic]][[mental]][[skill]][[stamina]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Diplomacy
* * *
**Requirements** The target ally lost Stamina Points within the last round.

* * *

You give an ally within 30 feet a quick pep talk, helping them recover. Attempt a Diplomacy check. The DC is usually 15, though the GM might adjust it based on the circumstances. If you have expert proficiency in Diplomacy, you can instead attempt a DC 20 check to increase the Stamina Points recovered by 5; if you have master proficiency, you can attempt a DC 30 check to increase the Stamina Points by 15; if you have legendary proficiency, you can attempt a DC 40 check to increase the Stamina Points by 25. No matter the result, the ally is temporarily immune to Encouraging Words until they either [[Actions/Take a Breather|Take a Breather]] or rest for the day.

* * *

**Critical Success** The ally recovers 2d8 Stamina Points.

**Success** The ally recovers 1d8 Stamina Points.

**Critical Failure** The ally takes 1d8 mental damage, but this can reduce only Stamina Points, never Hit Points.
