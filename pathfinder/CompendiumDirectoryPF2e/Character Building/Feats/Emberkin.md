# Emberkin
## Feat 1
### [[lineage]][[nephilim]]

**Category** ancestry; 




A peri's roaring spirit burns in your soul. Peris engage in constant struggle to right the wrongs of their fallen forebears, and that struggle has been passed on to you. You have a direct impulse to right wrongs and better the world.

You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against fire effects, and your perception is unaffected by non-magical flames, fog and smoke.
