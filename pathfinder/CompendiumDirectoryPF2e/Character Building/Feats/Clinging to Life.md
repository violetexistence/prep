# Clinging to Life `pf2:0`
## Feat 13
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[reincarnated]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** You're reduced to 0 hit points and don't immediately die.

* * *

This life still holds much for you, and you aren't ready to fall back into the River of Souls just yet. When you're reduced to 0 Hit Points and not immediately killed, you go to 1 Hit Point instead, fall [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]], and are [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]], and you don't gain the [[Conditions/Wounded|Wounded 1]] condition.
