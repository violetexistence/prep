# Darting Monkey
## Feat 5
### [[vanara]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You have a heightened awareness in combat, and your darting strikes prevent your foes from distracting you or breaking your focus. When you hit a creature of your level or lower while that creature is flanking you, flanking doesn't make you [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] to that creature. This benefit lasts until the start of your next turn or until the creature moves, whichever comes first. The creature can still help its other allies flank.
