# Slippery Secrets
## Feat 7
### [[general]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** master in Deception
* * *
You elude and evade attempts to uncover your true nature or intentions. When a spell or magical effect tries to read your mind, detect whether you are lying, or reveal your identity, you can attempt a Deception check against the spell or effect's DC. If you succeed, the effect reveals nothing.
