# Vacate Vision `pf2:r`
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Oozemorph Dedication
* * *
**Trigger** You fail (but don't critically fail) a saving throw against an effect with the visual trait.

* * *

You cause your eyes to liquefy and run out of your eye sockets, leaving them empty. You get a success on the save against the triggering effect, but you are [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] for the duration the effect would have had on a failure. At that time, your eyes regrow and your normal vision returns.
