# Predictive Purchase (Investigator)
## Feat 6
### [[investigator]]

**Category** class; 




You have just the thing for the situation. You gain the [[Feats/Prescient Planner|Prescient Planner]] and [[Feats/Prescient Consumable|Prescient Consumable]] feats.

When using Prescient Planner, you can pull out the item as a 2-action activity to remove your backpack (or a similar container) and draw the item, rather than taking 1 minute.
