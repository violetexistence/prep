# First World Magic
## Feat 1
### [[gnome]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Your connection to the First World grants you a primal innate spell, much like those of the fey. Choose one cantrip from the primal spell list. You can cast this spell as a primal innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell rank equal to half your level rounded up.
