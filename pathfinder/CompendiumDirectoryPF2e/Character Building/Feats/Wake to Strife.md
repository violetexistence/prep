# Wake to Strife `pf2:2`
## Feat 8
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[monk]][[occult]][[water]]

**Category** class; 




**Requirements** A creature within your reach is [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] or swimming.

* * *

You summon the explosive power of a geyser beneath a foe. The required creature must attempt a `Fortitude check` save against your class DC as elemental water confounds their senses; if the creature is prone, they can Stand as a free action.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]].

**Failure** The target is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]]. If you have a free hand and they are not larger than you, you can attempt an Athletics check to [[Actions/Grapple|Grapple]] them as a free action.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but if you succeed at the Athletics check to Grapple them, you get a critical success instead.
