With a moment spent focusing, you can locate the telltale signs of corruption no matter what means it may use to hide from your sight. For 1 minute, you can see through up to 5 feet of stone, wood, or similar barriers as if they didn't exist (though any amount of metal or denser barriers block this effect).
