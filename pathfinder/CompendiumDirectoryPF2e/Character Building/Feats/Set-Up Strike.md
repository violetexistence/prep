## Feat 2
### [[commander]][[flourish]]

**Category** class; 




Your attack makes it difficult for your enemy to defend themselves against your allies' attacks. Attempt a Strike against an enemy. If the Strike is successful, the target is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] against the next attack that one of your allies attempts against it before the start of your next turn.
