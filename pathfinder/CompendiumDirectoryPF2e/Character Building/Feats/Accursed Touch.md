# Accursed Touch
## Feat 8
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Mummy Dedication
* * *
You've learned to harness the supernatural curse that animates you, imbuing your most powerful attacks with a terrible curse. When you critically hit with a fist Strike, void energy binds to it; this is a curse and a disease. The creature takes 2d6 persistent void damage. While the creature has this persistent damage, it's also [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]]. The persistent damage increases to 3d6 at 14th level and 4d6 at 20th level. This is a critical specialization effect.
