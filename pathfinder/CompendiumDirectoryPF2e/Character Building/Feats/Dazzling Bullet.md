Your tricks discombobulate your opponent, leaving spots in their vision from the bright flash of your gunshot reflected straight into their eyes (or other visual organs). Attempt a `Performance check` check against the target creature's Will DC and make a ranged firearm Strike against that target. If the Strike deals damage to the target creature and you succeed at the Performance check, the creature is [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] for 1 round.
