# Tidal Hands `pf2:2`
## Feat 1
### [[impulse]][[kineticist]][[overflow]][[primal]][[water]]

**Category** class; 




With an emphatic gesture, you create waves that rush out from you in the shape of your hands. You either form two 15-foot cones that don't overlap or you combine the hands into one 30-foot cone. Each creature in a wave takes 1d8 bludgeoning damage with a `Reflex check` save against your class DC. If a creature critically fails, you also push that creature 5 feet.

* * *

**Level (+2)** The damage increases by 1d8.
