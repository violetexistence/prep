# Accursed Clay Fist
## Feat 10
### [[archetype]][[curse]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Golem Grafter Dedication; expert in unarmed attacks
* * *
You have replaced one of your forearms with one made of clay and infused with cursed arcane magic. When you make an unarmed Strike with your clay fist and hit, your target takes a -2 status penalty to saving throws against curse effects for 1 hour.

* * *

**Special** The damage die for your clay fist is 1d8, and it loses the agile and finesse traits of a typical fist.
