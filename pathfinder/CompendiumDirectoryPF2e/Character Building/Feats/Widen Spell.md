# Widen Spell `pf2:1`
## Feat 1
### [[druid]][[manipulate]][[oracle]][[sorcerer]][[spellshape]][[witch]][[wizard]]

**Category** class; 




You manipulate the energy of your spell, causing it to spread out and affect a wider area. If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell that has an area of a burst, cone, or line and does not have a duration, increase the area of that spell. Add 5 feet to the radius of a burst that normally has a radius of at least 10 feet (a burst with a smaller radius is not affected). Add 5 feet to the length of a cone or line that is normally 15 feet long or smaller, and add 10 feet to the length of a larger cone or line.
