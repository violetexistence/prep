# Reprisal of the Fallen
## Feat 18
### [[mythic]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Broken Chain Dedication
* * *
You can feel the sorrow, pain, and rage of those fallen to oppression, peering from just behind the veil of death, and you can bring them forth to exact their revenge. You can cast either a 9th-rank [[Spells/Invoke Spirits|Invoke Spirits]] or [[Spells/Wails of the Damned|Wails of the Damned]] once per day as an innate occult spell. For either spell, use your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.
