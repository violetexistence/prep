# Feet That Stride the Sky
## Feat 2
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[mythic]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Acrobat's Calling
* * *
You feel the call of the sky, or perhaps a desperate urge to test the limits of the earth's hold on you. When you or a creature you're mounted on attempts a [[Actions/High Jump|High Jump]] or [[Actions/Long Jump|Long Jump]], you can spend a Mythic Point to allow you or the mount to attempt the check at mythic proficiency; determine the DC using the Long Jump DCs, and increase your maximum distance to double your Speed.
