Although the divinations of a haruspex traditionally require organs and lengthy interpretation, you've learned how to glimpse the future in a more simple fashion by reading creatures' wounds. The glimpse of the future gives guidance on what tools are best to use next. Roll 1d12 to determine the damage type favored by your prediction. The next time before the end of your next turn that you or your allies deals that damage type to an enemy, that enemy has weakness equal to your level against that damage.
