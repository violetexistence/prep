# Brightsoul
## Feat 1
### [[lineage]][[naari]]

**Category** ancestry; 




The fire inside you asserts itself as beaming, radiant light. Your body is naturally luminescent, glowing with the effects of a primal [[Spells/Light|Light]] cantrip. A cantrip is heightened to a spell rank equal to half your level rounded up. The light is involuntary and constant; if counteracted, it returns in 1d4 rounds. You suffer a -2 circumstance penalty on Stealth checks to Hide or Sneak and gain a +1 circumstance bonus on saves against light effects and effects that inflict the [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] or [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] conditions.
