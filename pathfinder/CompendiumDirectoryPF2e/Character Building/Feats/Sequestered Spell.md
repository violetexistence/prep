# Sequestered Spell
## Feat 1
### [[surki]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You consumed so much of a type of magic as a larva that you can now cast it purely on instinct. Choose one cantrip from the spell list of your magiphage ability. You can cast this cantrip as an innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell rank equal to half your level rounded up.
