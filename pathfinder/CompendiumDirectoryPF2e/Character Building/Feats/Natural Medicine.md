# Natural Medicine
## Feat 1
### [[general]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Nature
* * *
You can apply natural cures to heal your allies. You can use Nature instead of Medicine to [[Actions/Treat Wounds|Treat Wounds]], including higher Nature proficiency letting you attempt more difficult checks. It doesn't replace Medicine for uses of the skill other than Treat Wounds or for feat prerequisites.

If you're in the wilderness, you might have easier access to fresh ingredients, allowing you to gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your check to Treat Wounds using Nature, subject to the GM's determination.
