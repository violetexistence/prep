# Final Shot `pf2:3`
## Feat 18
### [[gunslinger]]

**Category** class; 




**Requirement** You're wielding an unloaded firearm.

* * *

You jam a triple charge of black powder into your weapon to unleash a devastating but risky and inaccurate attack. Interact to reload, expending three doses of black powder in addition to your normal black powder or ammunition, then Strike with your firearm against a creature within the weapon's first range increment. If you roll a success, the attack is instead a critical success, but if you roll a failure, the weapon misfires. Regardless of your roll, after the attack you're [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the start of your next turn and [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]].
