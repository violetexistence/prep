# Reset the Past `pf2:0`
## Feat 14
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Chronoskimmer Dedication
* * *
**Frequency** once per day

* * *

You manipulate time to recharge one of your temporal techniques-by revising your past so you never used it in the first place. Select one of your chronoskimmer feats that has a frequency of once per day (or more frequent) that you've already used. You can use the feat again, as if you hadn't used it already.
