# Drifting Pollen `pf2:1`
## Feat 8
### [[impulse]][[kineticist]][[plant]][[primal]][[stance]][[wood]]

**Category** class; 




A haze of pollen floats around you. A creature in your kinetic aura when you enter the stance, or who later enters the aura or ends its turn in the aura, attempts at a `Fortitude check` save against your class DC. On a failure, it's [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] ([[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]] on a critical failure) and [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] until it's no longer sickened. A creature attempts this save no more than once per round and doesn't attempt a new save if already affected.
