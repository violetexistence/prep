# Soothing Vials
## Feat 1
### [[alchemist]]

**Category** class; 




The healing chemicals in your versatile vials also help calm a patient's mind. When a living creature affected by a mental effect regains Hit Points from one of your versatile vials, it can immediately attempt a new Will saving throw to end one mental effect of its choice. It gains a +1 item bonus to the saving throw.
