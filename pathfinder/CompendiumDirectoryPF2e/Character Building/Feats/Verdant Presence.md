## Feat 20
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[druid]]

**Category** class; 




**Frequency** once per hour

**Trigger** You take damage or cast a primal spell.

* * *

The life-giving properties of the _aeon orbs_ flourish within you. Small plants or fungi magically appear on all surfaces in a 60-foot emanation around you. This life withers after 1 day unless the environment can support it. You can choose one of the following options each time you use this feat.

*   You can cause any number of 5-foot squares in the area to be light undergrowth, which is difficult terrain and provides lesser cover.
*   You can cause a tree or giant mushroom to appear in any unoccupied location in the area; it occupies an entire 5-foot square and provides standard cover. The tree or mushroom has 5 Hardness and 50 Hit Points.
