# Remote Trigger
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Snarecrafter Dedication
* * *
You've learned how to trigger snares from afar, creating ranged hazards to assail your opponents and allowing you to disarm enemies' snares harmlessly.

You can Strike a snare to trigger it prematurely. If you crafted the snare, you automatically hit. If someone else crafted it, attempt a ranged Strike against the Crafting DC, triggering the snare only if you hit.
