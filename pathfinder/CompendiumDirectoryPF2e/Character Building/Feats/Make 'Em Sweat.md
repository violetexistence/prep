# Make 'Em Sweat
## Feat 12
### [[investigator]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** interrogation methodology
* * *
Your line of questioning lets a suspect know you can see right through them, shaking them to the core. When you succeed at using [[Actions/Pointed Question|Pointed Question]], the target is also [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]] (or [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] on a critical success). This added effect is an emotion and fear effect, but the other effects of Pointed Question still apply even if the target is immune to fear.
