# Emissary of Peace `pf2:3`
## Feat 10
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Knight Vigilant Dedication; master in Diplomacy
* * *
Even when bloodshed is inevitable, you would rather see your foes surrender. You attempt a Diplomacy check to [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] against a single foe whose Hit Points are at less than half of their maximum value, followed by an immediate Request to convince that creature to cease fighting. You take a -5 penalty to your Diplomacy check. The GM sets the DC of the Request based on the circumstances; it's generally at least a very hard DC for the creature's level. Some creatures might simply refuse, and those who agree to parley might find your arguments lacking and start fighting again.
