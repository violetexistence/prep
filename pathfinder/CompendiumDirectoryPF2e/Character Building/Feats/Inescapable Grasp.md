## Feat 12
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Wrestler Dedication
* * *
Your grasp has a supernatural quality to it, preventing your foes from easily escapingâ€”with or without magical assistance. If a creature you have [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] attempts to use a teleportation spell or effect, it must succeed at a `DC 15 Flat check` or the spell fails. If a creature you have grabbed attempts to [[Actions/Escape|Escape]] while under the effect of [[Spells/Unfettered Movement|Unfettered Movement]] or a similar effect, it must succeed at a `DC 15 Flat check` or be forced to roll the Escape attempt normally, rather than automatically succeeding.
