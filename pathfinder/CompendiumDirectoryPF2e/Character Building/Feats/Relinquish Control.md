# Relinquish Control `pf2:0`
## Feat 1
### [[animist]][[apparition]]

**Category** class; 




**Trigger** Your turn begins.

* * *

Your apparition takes over and shields you from outside influence. Until the start of your next turn, you gain a +4 status bonus on saves against spells and effects that give you the controlled condition or attempt to influence your actions (such as charm, command, or a nosoi's haunting melody). However, the only actions you can take are to Recall Knowledge, Step, Strike, Cast an apparition Spell, Cast a vessel Spell, Sustain a vessel spell, or use an action that has the apparition trait. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus on all Recall Knowledge checks made using Lore skills granted by your attuned apparitions.

* * *

**Special** This feat requires a particularly strong bond with a specific apparition to learn. Choose one apparition you have access to; once you learn this feat, you must always choose that apparition as one of the apparitions you attune to each day.
