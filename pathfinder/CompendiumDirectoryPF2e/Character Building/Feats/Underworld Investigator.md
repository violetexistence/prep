# Underworld Investigator
## Feat 1
### [[investigator]]

**Category** class; 




Your work as an investigator makes you familiar with the criminal element. You might be a criminal yourself, or you might have gained an understanding of how they operate from the outside. You become trained in Underworld Lore, and you gain your [[Actions/Pursue a Lead|Pursue a Lead]] investigation bonus to Thievery checks to investigate a case (such as checks to [[Actions/Steal|Steal]] a clue from a suspect or [[Actions/Pick a Lock|Pick a Lock]] to open a safe with damning documents).
