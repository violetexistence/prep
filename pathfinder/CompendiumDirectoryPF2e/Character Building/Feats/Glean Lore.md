You tap into the collected lore of the divine, accessing a variety of potentially useful information.

Attempt a `Religion check` check to understand the information you gain. The GM sets the DC (similar to the DC to [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]]), potentially adjusting the DC of the check for topics far removed from your mystery.

**Failure** You recall incorrect information or gain an erroneous or misleading clue.

**Critical Failure** You recall two pieces of incorrect information or gain two erroneous or misleading clues.
