# Touch Focus `pf2:0`
## Feat 16
### [[archetype]][[manipulate]][[spellshape]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Sixth Pillar Dedication
* * *
**Trigger** You begin to Cast a Spell that requires a spell attack roll.

* * *

You can redirect a spell's power through you to deliver it within striking distance. If your next action is to Cast a Spell with 1 or more targets and a range farther than touch, you change the range to touch. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the attack. This only allows you to touch a single target with the spell, even if the spell originally affected more than 1 target. As long as your spell attack is successful, the target is knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] in addition to the spell's normal effects.
