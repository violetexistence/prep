# Epiphany at the Crossroads `pf2:0`
## Feat 12
### [[divine]][[oracle]]

**Category** class; 




**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** Your turn begins.

**Requirements** You are [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]] and have the [[Conditions/Dying|Dying]] condition.

* * *

The crossroads between life and death is a place that can reveal many secrets. You gain the effects of an [[Spells/Augury|Augury]] spell in a strange, near-death vision. Empowered by the realization, you then lose the dying condition (becoming [[Conditions/Wounded|Wounded 1]] or increasing your wounded value by 1, as normal), regain 2 healing Hit Points, and can Stand.
