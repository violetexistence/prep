# Snare Genius
## Feat 5
### [[kobold]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** expert in Crafting; Snare Crafting
* * *
If the snare normally takes 1 minute to Craft, you can Craft it with 3 Interact actions instead. Each day during your daily preparations, you can prepare three snares from your formula book for quick deployment (increasing to four snares if you're a master in Crafting and five if you're legendary). Snares prepared in this way don't cost you any resources to Craft.

When a creature critically fails its saving throw against and takes damage from the initial effect of a snare you Crafted and deployed, that creature is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the end of its next turn.
