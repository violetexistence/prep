# Distracting Spellstrike `pf2:2`
## Feat 4
### [[magus]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** laughing shadow hybrid study; Spellstrike
* * *
**Requirements** You're in Arcane Cascade stance and have a hand free.

* * *

You weave distracting magic with one hand to enhance your Spellstrike. Make a Spellstrike and [[Actions/Feint|Feint]] against the target of your Strike. Do this immediately before making the Strike, but after choosing your target.

The [[Actions/feint traits=arcane,illusion,visual|feint traits=arcane,illusion,visual]] gains the arcane, illusion, and visual traits, and it always has the basic effects of a Feint, rather than applying any adjustments or alternate effects from other feats or abilities.
