# Gaping Flesh `pf2:r`
## Feat 5
### [[fleshwarp]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** A creature you are aware of damages you with a melee Strike.

* * *

Your wound yawns open, appalling your attacker. The attacker must succeed at a `Fortitude check` saving throw against your class or spell DC, whichever is higher, or become [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] ([[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]] on a critical failure). It can't recover from the sickened condition while it's adjacent to you.
