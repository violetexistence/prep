# Guide the Timeline `pf2:1`
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]][[concentrate]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Chronoskimmer Dedication
* * *
**Frequency** once per day

You know the result you want and subtly nudge the timeline to your intended destination. Choose an ally or a foe. If you choose an ally, the next time within the next round that ally makes an attack roll or skill check, they roll it twice and take the higher result; this is a fortune effect. If you choose a foe, the next time within the next round that foe makes an attack roll or skill check, they must roll twice and take the lower result unless they succeed at a `Will check` save against your chronoskimmer DC; this is a misfortune effect. Regardless of your choice, the target becomes temporarily immune for 24 hours.
