## Feat 8
### [[archetype]][[emotion]][[magical]][[mental]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Eldritch Archer Dedication
* * *
With a single whisper carried on the wind, you enchant your ammunition to make a foe more vulnerable to your attacks.

Make a bow or crossbow Strike. On a hit, the target takes an additional 2d6 mental damage. On a critical hit, the target also becomes [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]]. The mental damage increases to 3d6 if your weapon has a _greater striking rune_, or to 4d6 if your weapon has a _major striking rune_.
