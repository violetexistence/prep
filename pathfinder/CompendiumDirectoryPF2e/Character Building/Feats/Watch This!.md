# Watch This! `pf2:r`
## Feat 6
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[archetype]][[auditory]][[emotion]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Duelist Dedication or Pirate Dedication
* * *
**Trigger** An ally misses or critically misses an enemy you can see with their attack.

* * *

A common saying among Firebrands is, "There's always a fool who thinks they can do it betterâ€”and they're often right." You verbally commit to using an action on your next turn to make a melee Strike against the same enemy your ally has missed. If your attack hits, you deal additional damage equal to twice the number of damage dice.
