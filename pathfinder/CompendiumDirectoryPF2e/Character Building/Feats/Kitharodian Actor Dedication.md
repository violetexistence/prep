# Kitharodian Actor Dedication
## Feat 2
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[archetype]][[dedication]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Performance
* * *
**Access** You are from Taldor or have attended Kitharodian Academy.

* * *

You've studied classic Taldan theater and learned to embody various roles to a sublime degree. You become trained in Society and in Theater Lore; if you were already trained in either, you become an expert in that skill instead. In addition, when you attempt a Deception or Performance check to portray a famous figure, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your check. This bonus changes to +3 at 10th level and +4 at 17th level. However, you don't gain this bonus while Impersonating a figure whose death is common knowledge (as determined by the GM).
