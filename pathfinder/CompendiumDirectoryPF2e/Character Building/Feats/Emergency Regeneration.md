# Emergency Regeneration `pf2:r`
## Feat 16
### [[archetype]][[healing]][[primal]][[vitality]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Wild Mimic Dedication; you have deactivated a creature's regeneration for at least 1 round or have identified a creature with regeneration in combat
* * *
**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** You're reduced to 0 hit points from damage that's neither acid nor fire.

* * *

You have battled against foes whose bodies naturally regenerate, and while yours doesn't do so all the time, it can happen in a pinch. You gain the effects of a 7th-rank [[Spells/Regenerate|Regenerate]] spell. At 20th level, you gain the effects of a 9th-rank _regenerate_ instead.
