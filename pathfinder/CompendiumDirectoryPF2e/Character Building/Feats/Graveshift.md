# Graveshift
## Feat 14
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[archetype]][[divine]][[teleportation]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Secret Eater
* * *
**Frequency** Once per day

**Requirements** You are standing at the bottom of an open grave adjacent to up to four willing target creatures or objects roughly the size of a creature.

* * *

The maggots inhabiting your body impart you with the knowledge to travel from grave to grave, drawing upon the mystical power of the labyrinthine network of magical warrens and tunnels that connect Everglut to the Material Plane. You can spend 10 minutes channeling this power to transport you and all target creatures or objects that are inside the grave you are standing in to a chosen grave you are aware of (unoccupied or occupied) within 100 miles. When you target an occupied or filled grave, you and all transported creatures and objects appear scattered aboveground around the targeted grave (or belowground in adjacent tunnels or passageways if available).
