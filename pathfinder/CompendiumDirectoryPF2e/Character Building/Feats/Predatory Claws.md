# Predatory Claws
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Vampire Dedication
* * *
Your nails grow into sharp claws, perfect for seizing and tearing your prey. You gain a claw unarmed attack that deals 1d4 slashing damage. Your claws are in the brawling group and have the agile, finesse, and unarmed traits.

If you hit the same enemy with two consecutive claw Strikes in the same round, you can attempt to [[Actions/Grapple|Grapple]] that same target as a free action, provided you take that action immediately after the second Strike.
