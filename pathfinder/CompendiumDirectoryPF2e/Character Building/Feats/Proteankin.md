# Proteankin
## Feat 1
### [[lineage]][[nephilim]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Your blood bubbles with the roiling quintessence of the Maelstrom, the infinite sea of primal chaos that long ago spawned the other Outer Planes. You gain resistance to a single damage type equal to half your level; at the beginning of each day, determine randomly whether this resistance applies to acid, electricity, or sonic damage. You also gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against effects that would cause you to gain the controlled condition.
