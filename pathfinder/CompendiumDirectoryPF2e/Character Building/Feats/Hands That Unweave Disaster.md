# Hands That Unweave Disaster
## Feat 2
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[mythic]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Thief's Calling
* * *
Your hands move with uncanny sureness, dismantling danger. When you attempt an Acrobatics check to [[Actions/Grab an Edge|Grab an Edge]], you can spend a Mythic Point to attempt the check at mythic proficiency. You can expend a Mythic Point when attempting to [[Actions/Disable a Device|Disable a Device]] to attempt the check at mythic proficiency. As normal when attempting a check with mythic proficiency, this allows you to attempt to Disable a Device even if the check normally requires expert or greater proficiency.
