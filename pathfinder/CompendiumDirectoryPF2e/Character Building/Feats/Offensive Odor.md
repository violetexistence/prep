# Offensive Odor
## Feat 17
### [[athamaru]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Emit Defensive Odor
* * *
You've mastered your defensive pheromones and have nearly complete control over them. When you Emit Defensive Odor, you can either choose to increase the damage dealt to a single target by changing the damage dice to d8s (2d8 poison), or leave the damage unchanged but spray your pheromones in a 15-foot cone.
