# Festering Wounds
## Feat 12
### [[archetype]][[disease]][[divine]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Zombie Dedication
* * *
Wounds you inflict with your unarmed attacks fester and rot, becoming infected and difficult to heal. The DC to Treat these Wounds using Medicine increases by 5, and magically or alchemically healing these wounds requires a counteract check against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. Succeeding at any of these removes the disease. The effect also ends if the creature is healed to full Hit Points by any means.
