# Seven-Part Link
## Feat 16
### [[thaumaturge]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Paired Link
* * *
Many traditions hold the number seven as significant. By exchanging pieces of a seven-part set of esoterica, you create a magical web by which your allies can affect each other at a distance. When you use [[Feats/Paired Link|Paired Link]] during your daily preparations, you can exchange linking esoterica with up to six willing allies, keeping one piece for yourself. In addition to the normal effects of Paired Link, if a linked ally casts a spell with a range of touch, they can target linked allies within 30 feet with that spell.
