You call on a guardian of the wild to burst forth from the land to aid you. You can cast [[Spells/Spiritual Guardian|Spiritual Guardian]] as a 5th-rank innate primal spell once per day, even if you don't have a deity; this guardian manifests as a kami or other nature spirit. When you reach 17th level, you can heighten this spell to 7th rank.
