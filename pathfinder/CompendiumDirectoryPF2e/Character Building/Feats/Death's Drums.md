# Death's Drums
## Feat 9
### [[orc]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Your life has been spent challenging death itself, and proximity to that implacable foe only makes your heart beat harder.

When you are taking persistent damage or your [[Conditions/Wounded|Wounded]] value is 1 or greater, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Fortitude saving throws.
