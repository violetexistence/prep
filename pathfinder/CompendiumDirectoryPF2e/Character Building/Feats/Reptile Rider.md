# Reptile Rider
## Feat 1
### [[lizardfolk]]

**Category** ancestry; 




To you, crocodilians, giant lizards, and dinosaurs are loyal steeds, not monsters. You gain the [[Feats/Ride|Ride]] feat, even if you don't meet the prerequisites. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Nature checks to Handle an Animal as long as the animal is a reptile, dinosaur, or even a non-sapient dragon.

_**Note** This feat refers to Nature checks to Handle an Animal. This check does not exist in Pathfinder 2, and so the feat instead gives a bonus to Nature checks to [[Actions/Command an Animal|Command an Animal]]._
