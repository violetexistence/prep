# Animal Elocutionist
## Feat 1
### [[gnome]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You hear animal sounds as conversations instead of unintelligent noise, and you can respond in turn. You can ask questions of, receive answers from, and use the Diplomacy skill with animals. In most cases, wild animals will give you time to make your case. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] on animals.
