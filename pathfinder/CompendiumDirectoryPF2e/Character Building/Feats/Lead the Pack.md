# Lead the Pack
## Feat 16
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Mature Beastmaster Companion; you have multiple animal companions
* * *
You can have up to two animal companions active at once. However, when you do, it's slightly more difficult to [[Actions/Command an Animal|Command]] them. If you don't Command either of your companions, one of the two (your choice) can still use 1 action on your turn to Stride or Strike, as per Mature Beastmaster Companion, but not both.

When you Command an Animal, either choose one of the companions to take 2 actions, as normal, or else both companions can take 1 action to Stride or Strike. Either way, you can't Command an Animal to make either companion act again until your next turn.
