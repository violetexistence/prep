**Prerequisites** Magic Warrior Dedication

Your mask protects you further from divination. Once per day, you can cast [[Spells/Veil of Privacy|Veil of Privacy]] on yourself, heightened to the highest rank of spell you can cast; the spell ends immediately if your mask is removed for even a moment. The spell is of the same tradition as your focus spells.
