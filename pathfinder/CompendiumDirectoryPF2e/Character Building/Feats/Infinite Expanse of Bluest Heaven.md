# Infinite Expanse of Bluest Heaven `pf2:3`
## Feat 18
### [[air]][[illusion]][[impulse]][[kineticist]][[mental]][[overflow]][[primal]][[visual]]

**Category** class; 




An illusion of a limitless expanse with an impossibly blue sky makes all within feel the sensation of falling... forever. The vision appears in a 20-foot burst within 100 feet. The illusion lasts until the end of your next turn, but you can Sustain it up to 1 minute. Using this impulse again ends any previous one. Each creature in the area or that later enters it must attempt a `Will check` save against your class DC. Creatures with the air trait are immune. Any effect of the illusion ends for a creature as soon as it leaves the illusion's area or the impulse ends, and the creature then becomes temporarily immune for 1 hour.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]].

**Failure** The creature is off-guard. It is [[Conditions/Fleeing|Fleeing]] from the illusory sky but is also disoriented; any time it uses an action to attempt to flee, it must succeed at a `DC 11 Flat check` or flee to a space that's still within the illusion. The GM determines where the creatures ends up, but the creature can't stay stationary if it's able to move.
