# Energy Interceptor
## Feat 4
### [[guardian]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Intercept Attack
* * *
Though other guardians understand how to anticipate the flow of martial combat, you predict blasts of magical lightning, blazing trap runes, and more. You can use [[Actions/Intercept Attack|Intercept Attack]] when an ally would take acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage, not only when they would take physical damage.
