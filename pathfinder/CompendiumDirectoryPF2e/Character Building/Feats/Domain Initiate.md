# Domain Initiate
## Feat 1
### [[cleric]]

**Category** class; 




Your deity bestows a special spell related to their powers. Select one domain—a subject of particular interest to you within your religion—from your deity's list. You gain an initial domain spell for that domain, a spell unique to the domain and not available to other clerics.

Domain spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to pray to your deity or do service toward their causes.

Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and can't be cast using spell slots. Your focus pool can hold one Focus Point for each focus spell you have, up to 3 points.

**Special** You can select this feat multiple times, selecting a different domain each time and gaining its domain spell.
