# Silk Bracelet `pf2:2`
## Feat 6
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[inventor]][[manipulate]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** armor, construct, or weapon innovation
* * *
**Access** Tian Xia origin

* * *

Taking inspiration from Desna's image as a giant silk moth in Tian Xia, you've attached a bracelet to your innovation that generates ultra-strong silk strands mixed with venom. You can unleash this substance as part of an attack. Make a melee Strike. If it hits, the target takes damage from the Strike as normal and must attempt a `Fortitude check` save against your class DC with the following effects.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The silk imposes a â€“10 foot status penalty to all the target's Speeds for 1 round.

**Failure** As success, and the target takes an additional 0d4 persistent poison damage. The poison damage increases to 2d4 at 12th level and 3d4 at 18th level.

**Critical Failure** As failure, and the target is [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] until the end of their next turn.

* * *

**Special** If your innovation is a minion, it can take this action rather than you.
