# See the Unseen
## Feat 13
### [[goloma]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You notice things that others can't see at all. While you're adjacent to an [[Conditions/Undetected|Undetected]] creature of your level or lower, it is instead only [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] from you. You only need a successful `DC 5 Flat check` to target a hidden creature.
