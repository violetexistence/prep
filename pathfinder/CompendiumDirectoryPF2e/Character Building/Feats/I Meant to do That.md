## Feat 10
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Unexpected Sharpshooter Dedication; trained in Deception
* * *
**Frequency** once per hour

**Requirements** Your previous action was a ranged weapon Strike that missed a foe within 60 feet.

* * *

Somehow your stray bullet causes an unintended reaction that creates a problem for your enemy: perhaps a ricochet knocks your foe's weapon away or they stumble over stray debris in an attempt to dodge your bullets. Roll a Deception check to attempt to [[Actions/Shove|Shove]] [[Actions/shove statistic=deception|shove statistic=deception]], [[Actions/Trip|Trip]] ([[Actions/trip statistic=deception|trip statistic=deception]]), or [[Actions/Disarm|Disarm]] ([[Actions/disarm statistic=deception|disarm statistic=deception]])the foe you missed.
