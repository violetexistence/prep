# Water Walker
## Feat 8
### [[oracle]]

**Category** class; 




When in the throes of your curse, your steps take on a supernatural buoyancy. When you are [[Conditions/Cursebound|Cursebound 1]], you can Stride across liquids that don't support your weight, but you must end your movement on a surface that can support you or you fall into the liquid as normal. When you are cursebound 2 or worse, you gain the effects of water walk.
