# Invulnerable Rager
## Feat 8
### [[barbarian]]

**Category** class; 




Even the heaviest armors serve only to enhance your unbridled fury. You are trained in heavy armor. Whenever you gain a barbarian class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency in medium armor, you also gain that proficiency in heavy armor. If you have the [[Actions/Quick-Tempered|Quick-Tempered]] action, you can use it while wearing heavy armor.
