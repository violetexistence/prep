# Red-Gold Mortality
## Feat 2
### [[exemplar]][[ikon]][[void]]

**Category** class; 




**Usage** imbued into a weapon ikon

* * *

By channeling your divinity into a creature along with a strike, you can disrupt their ability to recover. The imbued ikon gains the following ability.

**Immanence** When you successfully damage an enemy with the ikon, a marking appears around the wound, painted in the red of mortal blood and the gold of divine ichor. When the target would regain Hit Points, such as from a healing effect or an ability like fast healing or regeneration, it must attempt a `Will check` save against your class DC to determine the effects, and then the marking fades. The marking otherwise fades after 1 minute.

* * *

**Success** The creature regains the full number of Hit Points that would be healed.

**Failure** The creature regains only half the number of Hit Points as the contradictory energies swirl within it.

**Critical Failure** The creature doesn't regain any Hit Points.
