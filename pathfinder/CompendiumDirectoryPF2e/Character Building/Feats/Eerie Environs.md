# Eerie Environs
## Feat 8
### [[druid]][[ranger]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Intimidation; trained in Stealth
* * *
The natural world can be scary to those not used to it-and you make it scarier still. If you're [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] from a creature, you can attempt to [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] it without losing your hidden condition-imitating the sounds of strange beasts or causing the foliage to rustle menacingly. When you do so, you don't take a penalty to your check if the target doesn't understand your language.
