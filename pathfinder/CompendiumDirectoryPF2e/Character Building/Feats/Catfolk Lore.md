# Catfolk Lore
## Feat 1
### [[catfolk]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Growing up among catfolk has taught you the traditional values of freedom, stewardship, and quick reactions to trouble. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Acrobatics and Survival. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.

You also gain the [[Feats/Additional Lore|Additional Lore]] general feat for Catfolk Lore.
