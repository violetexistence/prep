# Esoteric Spellcasting
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Palatine Detective Dedication
* * *
Your study of a variety of esoteric texts and supernatural matters has broadened your mind and improved your spellcasting. Choose a 1st-rank occult or divine spell. You can cast this spell once per day as an innate spell. At 6th level, you gain a 2nd-rank spell of the same tradition you chose, and at 8th level, you gain a 3rd-rank spell, also of that tradition.

* * *

**Special** You can take this feat a second time, choosing spells from the other available tradition.
