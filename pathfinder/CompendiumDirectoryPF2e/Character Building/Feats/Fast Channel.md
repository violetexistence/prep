# Fast Channel
## Feat 14
### [[cleric]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** harmful font or healing font
* * *
Divine power is always at your fingertips, swiftly responding to your call. When you cast [[Spells/Harm|Harm]] or [[Spells/Heal|Heal]] by spending 2 actions, you can get the effects of the 3-action version instead of the 2-action version.

You can do this with _harm_ if you have harmful font or _heal_ if you have healing font (or both if you have Versatile Font).
