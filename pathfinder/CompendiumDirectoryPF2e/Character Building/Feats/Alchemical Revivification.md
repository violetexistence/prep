# Alchemical Revivification
## Feat 20
### [[alchemist]]

**Category** class; 




If you die while under the effect of at least one elixir, the alchemical compounds in your bloodstream bring you back to life at the start of your next turn. You're affected by an [[Equipment/Elixir of Rejuvenation|Elixir of Rejuvenation]], then a [[Equipment/Elixir of Life (True)|true elixir of life]], then your choice of a [[Equipment/Bestial Mutagen (Major)|major bestial mutagen]], [[Equipment/Juggernaut Mutagen (Major)|major juggernaut mutagen]], or [[Equipment/Quicksilver Mutagen (Major)|major quicksilver mutagen]] as though you just imbibed it. These automatic reactions don't get any special benefits you add when creating or using these items. Because you died, all other alchemical compounds in your bloodstream are inert. After being revived, you're temporarily immune to Alchemical Rejuvenation for 1d4 hours.
