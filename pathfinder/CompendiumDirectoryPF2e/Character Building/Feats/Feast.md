# Feast `pf2:2`
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]][[manipulate]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Zombie Dedication
* * *
**Requirements** You are adjacent to a [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]] or [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]] creature, or a deceased creature that died in the past hour.

* * *

You feast upon an adjacent restrained or unconscious creature, or a deceased creature that died in the past hour. If the creature is alive, you deal damage equal to your jaws damage. Whether it's alive or not, you gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to half your level that last for 1 minute.

You can instead choose to gain temporary Hit Points equal to double your level, but if you do, you must succeed at a `DC 6 Flat check` or your body deteriorates.
