## Feat 10
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[aftermath]][[magical]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** You have succeeded at an important task given by a dragon such as procuring a special treasure for their hoard
* * *
In pleasing the cravings of a mighty dragon, they have deigned to impart some of their magical essence into your body. Your eyes begin to glow and change color while your limbs and neck grow a veneer of scales, all the same color as the associated dragon, accompanied by a near-insatiable desire to amass a hoard of your own. You gain the [[Spells/Dragon Breath|Dragon Breath]] sorcerer bloodline spell, emulating the breath of the associated dragon, and a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. If you already have a focus pool, increase your number of Focus Points by 1. You Refocus by counting and arranging your treasure.
