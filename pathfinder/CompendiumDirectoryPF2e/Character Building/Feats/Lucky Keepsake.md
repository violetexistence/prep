**Prerequisites** Leshy Superstition

You have a [[Equipment/Lucky Keepsake|Keepsake]] that grants you luck. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saves against spells and magical effects at all times, not just when you use [[Feats/Leshy Superstition|Leshy Superstition]]. If you lose the keepsake, you lose the bonus until you designate a new keepsake, typically over the course of a week.
