# Favored Prey
## Feat 4
### [[ranger]]

**Category** class; 




You have studied a specific type of wild creature and can hunt it more easily. When you gain this feat, choose animals, beasts, dragons, or both fungi and plants as your favored prey. When you roll initiative and can see an enemy that belongs to the chosen category, you can Hunt Prey as a free action, designating that enemy.

You can use this free action even if you haven't identified the creature yet with Recall Knowledge. The benefit doesn't apply against favored enemies disguised as other creatures, and the GM determines whether it applies against a creature disguised as a favored prey.
