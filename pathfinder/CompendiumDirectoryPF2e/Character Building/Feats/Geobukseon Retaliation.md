# Geobukseon Retaliation `pf2:r`
## Feat 10
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[fire]][[inventor]][[modification]][[unstable]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** armor innovation
* * *
**Access** Tian Xia origin

**Trigger** You would take damage.

* * *

Your armor has a retractable spike-covered shell reminiscent of Hwanggot's heavily armored geobukseon, or "turtle ships." The shell unfolds across your body, giving you a +4 circumstance bonus to AC and resistance 2 to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage until the end of your next turn. Spiked chains propelled by small bursts of black powder also erupt from the shell, dealing 3d4 piercing + 2 persistent fire damage (`Reflex check` save against your class DC) to all creatures in a 5-foot emanation.
