# Frightful Attrition
## Feat 12
### [[archetype]][[emotion]][[fear]][[incapacitation]][[mental]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Guerrilla Dedication
* * *
Your diminishment of your foes' ranks damages their morale. Whenever you reduce a creature to 0 HP with a Strike or spell, all enemies within 30 feet of the downed creature who witnessed the attack must attempt a `Will check` saving throw against your class DC. A creature that didn't see you directly (such as if you're [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]] or remained [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] after the attack) takes a â€“2 circumstance penalty to this save. Regardless of the result, each creature is temporarily immune to your Frightful Attrition for 10 minutes.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]].

**Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]].

**Critical Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 3]] and [[Conditions/Fleeing|Fleeing]] for 1 round.
