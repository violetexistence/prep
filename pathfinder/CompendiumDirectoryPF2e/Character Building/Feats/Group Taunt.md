# Group Taunt
## Feat 8
### [[guardian]]

**Category** class; 




Your taunts draw the attention of multiple enemies at once. When you use [[Actions/Taunt|Taunt]], you can choose up to three targets within range, and you can have up to three taunted enemies at a time. Each time you Taunt, you can choose which enemies remain taunted and which the effect ends for. You must remain at or below this limit.
