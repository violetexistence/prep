# Crusader's Masquerade
## Feat 14
### [[archetype]][[concentrate]][[skill]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Mask Familiar; expert in Stealth
* * *
**Requirements** You're wearing your [[Feats/Mask Familiar|Mask Familiar]] in its mask form, and it has the [[Familiar Abilities/Skilled|Skilled]] (Religion) familiar ability.

* * *

Your mask can hide you from the undead. You become [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] to undead using vision or lifesense, allowing you to [[Actions/Hide|Hide]] and [[Actions/Sneak|Sneak]] without other sources of cover or concealment. This effect lasts only as long as you continue to take no actions other than to Hide, Sneak, [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]], [[Actions/Command an Animal|Command an Animal]] to direct your mask familiar, or other surreptitious actions. The GM determines which actions end the effect, but attacking, casting spells, activating items, and the like always do.
