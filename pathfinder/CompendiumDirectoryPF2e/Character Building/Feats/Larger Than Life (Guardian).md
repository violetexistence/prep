# Larger Than Life (Guardian)
## Feat 1
### [[guardian]]

**Category** class; 




When you're clad in the heaviest of armors, you have an outsized presence. Though you don't get any larger, you're treated as one size larger for the purposes of affecting other creatures with actions like [[Actions/Disarm|Disarm]], [[Actions/Grapple|Grapple]], [[Actions/Reposition|Reposition]], [[Actions/Shove|Shove]], and [[Actions/Trip|Trip]] while wearing heavy armor. Similarly, you're treated as one size larger for the purposes of creatures affecting you with those same actions, as well as with Swallow Whole and similar actions, while wearing heavy armor.
