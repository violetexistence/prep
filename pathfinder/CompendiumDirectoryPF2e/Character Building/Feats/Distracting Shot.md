# Distracting Shot
## Feat 12
### [[ranger]]

**Category** class; 




The sheer power of your attacks, or the overwhelming number of them, leaves an enemy flustered. If you critically hit your hunted prey with a ranged weapon, or hit it at least twice on the same turn with a ranged weapon, it's [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the start of your next turn.
