# Gossip Lore
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Dandy Dedication
* * *
Your time gossiping in fashionable salons keeps you informed on every topic.

You are trained in Gossip Lore, a special Lore skill that can be used only to [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]], but on any topic. If you fail a check to Recall Knowledge with Gossip Lore, you get the effects of the [[Feats/Dubious Knowledge|Dubious Knowledge]] skill feat.

If you have legendary proficiency in Society, you gain expert proficiency in Gossip Lore, but you can't increase your proficiency rank in Gossip Lore by any other means.
