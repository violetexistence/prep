While no one, not even you, might appear to understand why, you demonstrate a greater ability to hit your targets regardless of the obstacles in your way. You can use the [[Actions/Accidental Shot|Accidental Shot]] activity granted to you by the Unexpected Sharpshooter Dedication once per hour instead of once per day.
