You've expanded your focus spellcasting to techniques used by clerics and wizards. You gain an additional focus spell, either the necromancer school spell [[Spells/Call of the Grave|Call of the Grave]] or the initial domain spell of the death domain, [[Spells/Death's Call|Death's Call]]. Increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1.
