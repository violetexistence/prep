**Prerequisites** Scrollmaster Dedication

Experience or focused study have granted you mastery of a number of topics. When you know about something, you know about it in great detail. When you succeed at a check to [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]], you gain additional information or context. When you critically succeed at a check to Recall Knowledge, at the GM's discretion, you might gain even more additional information or context than normal.
