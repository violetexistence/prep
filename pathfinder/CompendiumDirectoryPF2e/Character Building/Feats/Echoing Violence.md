# Echoing Violence `pf2:0`
## Feat 18
### [[archetype]][[death]][[incapacitation]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Martial Artist Dedication
* * *
**Frequency** once per minute

**Trigger** You critically succeed with an unarmed Strike against an opponent.

* * *

Your powerful attack causes damage that reverberates through your opponent's body, shaking muscle from bone. The creature takes 10d6 bludgeoning damage with a `Fortitude check` save against your class DC. If it critically fails, it immediately dies as your blow tears apart its body internally.
