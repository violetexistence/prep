You hasten the passage of time for a living creature, prematurely aging them into decrepitude. A living creature within 60 feet takes 14d6 void damage and a part of its body you chose withers, taking the following penalties depending on the result of their a `Fortitude check` saving throw against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.

*   **Arms** The target's arms grow weak. The target becomes [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]].
*   **Head** The target has trouble thinking straight. The target becomes [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]].
*   **Legs** The target's legs buckle with every movement. The target takes a â€“10-foot status penalty to its Speeds.
*   **Torso** The target's skin becomes thin and papery. The target gains weakness 10 to slashing damage.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target takes half damage and the withering penalty lasts until the end of your next turn.

**Failure** The creature takes full damage and the withering penalty lasts for 1 minute.

**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage, and you can choose a second part of the body to wither. Both penalties last for 1 minute.
