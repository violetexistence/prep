# Bonded Animal
## Feat 2
### [[downtime]][[general]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** expert in Nature
* * *
You forge strong connections with animals. You can spend 7 days of downtime regularly interacting with a normal animal (not a companion or other special animal) that is friendly or helpful to you. After this duration, attempt a `Nature check` check against the animal's Will DC. If successful, you bond with the animal. The animal is permanently bonded to you until you form a bond with a different animal or do something egregious to break your bond.

A helpful animal is easier to direct. If your bonded animal is level â€“1, it gains the minion trait, allowing you to command it more efficiently. The maximum level of creature that can be your minion increases to 3 if you're a master in Nature and to 11 if you're legendary.

* * *

**Special** You can't have both a bonded animal and an animal companion (though you can have both a bonded animal and a pet or familiar).
