# Peafowl Stance `pf2:1`
## Feat 4
### [[monk]][[stance]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Monastic Weaponry

**Requirements** You are wielding a sword that has the monk trait in one hand.

You enter a tall and proud stance while remaining mobile, with all the grace and composure of a peafowl.

While in this stance, the only Strikes you can make are melee Strikes with the required sword. Once per round, after you hit with a monk sword Strike, you can Step as a free action as your next action.
