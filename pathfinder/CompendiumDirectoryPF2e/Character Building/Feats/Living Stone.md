# Living Stone
## Feat 12
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Stonebound Dedication
* * *
Your body becomes living stone. You don't need to eat or drink and need only 6 hours of rest to feel well rested. You must still rest at least 8 hours and spend 1 hour of preparation to regain resources usable only a limited number of times per day, such as spell slots. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against diseases, poisons, and effects that would cause the [[Conditions/Paralyzed|Paralyzed]] or [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned]] conditions. When you roll a successful saving throw against a disease or poison, you get a critical success instead.
