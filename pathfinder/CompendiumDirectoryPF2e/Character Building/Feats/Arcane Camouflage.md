# Arcane Camouflage
## Feat 9
### [[automaton]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Hunter automaton
* * *
You have developed magical techniques to aid you with stalking your prey. You can cast [[Spells/Blur|Blur]] and [[Spells/Invisibility|Invisibility]] each once per day as 2nd-rank arcane innate spells.

**Enhancement** Your camouflage is more potent. Your blur spell now lasts 10 minutes and when you cast invisibility, you can choose to gain the effects of the 4th-rank version of the spell. In addition, you can now cast blur and invisibility each twice per day.
