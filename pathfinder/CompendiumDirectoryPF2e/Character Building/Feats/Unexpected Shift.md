# Unexpected Shift `pf2:r`
## Feat 1
### [[gnome]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Trigger** You would take damage from an attack, spell, or other effect.

* * *

Your supernatural connection sometimes causes you to phase from reality when under threat, disappearing for split seconds before reappearing-often surprising you as much as your enemies. Roll a `DC 16 Flat check`. On a success, you gain resistance to all damage equal to your level against the triggering effect, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against that effect until the start of your turn, and you gain the [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] condition for 1 round.
