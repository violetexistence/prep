# The Moon Weaver's Art
## Feat 5
### [[sarangay]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You've learned to create minor illusions by collecting strands of moonlight and weaving them together to create small images or cloaking veils. You can cast either [[Spells/Illusory Object|Illusory Object]] or [[Spells/Invisible Item|Invisible Item]] as an occult innate spell once per day.
