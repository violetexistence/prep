# Sticky Poison
## Feat 6
### [[alchemist]]

**Category** class; 




A combination of additional viscosity and careful application keeps your weapons poisoned even when suffering significant wear and tear.

If your Strike with a poisoned weapon would expend its poison without your target attempting an initial save (due to resistance or your Strike being a critical failure, for example), attempt a `DC 5 Flat check`. On a success, your weapon remains poisoned.

If your Strike with a poisoned weapon succeeds, attempt a `DC 17 Flat check`. On a success, your weapon remains poisoned until the end of your next turn.
