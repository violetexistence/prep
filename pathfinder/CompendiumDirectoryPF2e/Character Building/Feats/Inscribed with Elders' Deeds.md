# Inscribed with Elders' Deeds
## Feat 6
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Tattooed Historian Dedication
* * *
Your tattoos commemorate unique exploits that (according to legends) only an orc could accomplish. During your daily preparations, you can reconfigure part of your storied skin to depict a specific orc hero, granting you a 1st-level ancestry feat with the orc trait until you prepare again; this ancestry feat cannot require any physiological feature you lack, as determined by the GM. Since this feat is temporary, you can't use it as a prerequisite for permanent character options, such as for a feat. At 13th level, you can instead gain a 5th-level ancestry feat with the orc trait.
