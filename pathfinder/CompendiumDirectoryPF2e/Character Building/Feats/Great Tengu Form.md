## Feat 17
### [[tengu]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Long-Nosed Form
* * *
You take on the imposing form of a large, winged spirit. Once per day, as part of using [[Feats/Long-Nosed Form|Long-Nosed Form]], you also gain the benefits of 4th-rank [[Spells/Enlarge|Enlarge]] and [[Spells/Fly|Fly]]. This lasts for 5 minutes or until you shift out of your Long-Nosed Form, whichever happens first.
