# All This Will Happen Again `pf2:r`
## Feat 1
### [[fortune]][[mental]][[samsaran]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Trigger** You fail or critically fail a Will save against an emotion effect.

* * *

Even in the face of overwhelming tribulation, you find solace in the notion that this feeling is fleeting; all things are merely part of a never-ending cycle. Reroll the triggering saving throw with a +1 status bonus. You must use the second result, even if it's worse.
