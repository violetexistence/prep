# Spot Translate `pf2:r`
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]][[auditory]][[linguistic]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Linguist Dedication
* * *
**Trigger** Another creature within 60 feet uses a linguistic effect in a language you understand.

* * *

You bridge a language gap, repeating the message in a different language that you know. Choose a language you understand to repeat the message in. The linguistic effect counts as both languages, rather than only the language the triggering creature is using, potentially allowing it to affect a wider range of creatures. As normal, you can translate normal speech without Spot Translate and without using a reaction, but this reaction allows you to apply the benefits of translation to spells and actions such as command or [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]].
