# Fiend Eternal
## Feat 20
### [[mythic]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Archfiend Dedication
* * *
Through all your machinations and accumulation of power, you have completed your apotheosis and become a true archfiend. You gain the fiend and unholy traits and are immune to your realm's damage type. You don't age. Your planned realm becomes a complete reality, forming within a section of Hell, the Outer Rifts, the Netherworld, its own fiendish demiplane, or some other planar space of your choosing. If you have the [[Feats/Seat of Power|Seat of Power]] feat, that seat of power is grafted onto your realm and the [[Actions/Enter Seat Of Power|Enter Seat Of Power]] activity transports you to any place within your realm; otherwise, you can enter and exit your realm in a similar fashion with a brief ritual that takes 10 minutes (though you can't bring anyone with you).

Whenever you would die, you are instead reduced to 0 Hit Points, become [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]], and are immediately transported to your seat of power within your realm. After 1 hour (or 1 round if you have the Seat of Power feat), you regain 5 Hit Points and reawaken. You can't leave your realm until you're fully healed or 1 week passes (whichever comes first).

In addition, you gain a small group of fiendish followers who reside in your realm. They never leave your realm (though one might occasionally come to your aid if you have the [[Feats/Marshall Fiendish Forces|Marshall Fiendish Forces]] feat), but they constantly spy on the mortal world to keep you informed. You are telepathically linked to these followers and can choose to speak with the group, or a specific fiend, as a three-action activity that has the concentrate trait. In doing so, you can avail yourself of the fiends' surveillance to learn about the world or current events. You can either [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] on any topic or [[Actions/Gather Information|Gather Information]]. If you critically fail to do either, you get a failure instead.
