# Battlefield Arcana
## Feat 12
### [[archetype]][[concentrate]][[spellshape]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Steady Spellcasting
* * *
You have learned to safely cast spells even in the heat of battle. If the next action you use is to cast a wizard cantrip, or a wizard spell that is at least 2 ranks lower than the highest-rank wizard spell slot you have, that spell does not trigger reactions that normally trigger due to a spell being cast or someone using an action with the manipulate trait.
