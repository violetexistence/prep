# Claw and Talon Flow `pf2:1`
## Feat 12
### [[archetype]][[flourish]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Clawdancer Dedication
* * *
**Requirements** You're in either claw stance or talon stance.

* * *

You fluidly shift between your two stances. You use the unarmed attack associated with your current clawdancer stance, then switch into the other stance (if you're in claw stance, make a frenzied claw Strike and then shift to talon stance, or vice versa).
