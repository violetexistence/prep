# Cloud Jump
## Feat 15
### [[general]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** legendary in Athletics
* * *
Your unparalleled athletic skill allows you to jump impossible distances. Triple the distance you jump on a successful [[Actions/Long Jump|Long Jump]] (so you could jump 90 feet with an Athletics result of 30). When you successfully [[Actions/High Jump|High Jump]], use the distance jumped and distance limit for a Long Jump but don't triple the distance.

You can jump a distance greater than your Speed by spending additional actions when you Long Jump or High Jump. For each additional action spent, add your Speed to the distance limit.
