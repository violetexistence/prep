You often find that the best way to win a conflict means avoiding a fight in the first place. You're good at talking to potential opponents without making things worse. If you would critically fail at a check to Make an Impression, you instead fail. You can attempt checks to make Requests of creatures who're indifferent or unfriendly toward you.
