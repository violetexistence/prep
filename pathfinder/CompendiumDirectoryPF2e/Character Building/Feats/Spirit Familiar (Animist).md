# Spirit Familiar (Animist)
## Feat 1
### [[animist]]

**Category** class; 




When you attune to your apparitions during your daily preparations, you can choose to dedicate a small amount of your life force to allow one of them to physically manifest as a familiar, which gains the spirit trait. If your familiar is slain or destroyed, you lose all other benefits from the apparition until you remanifest the familiar during your next daily preparations. If you disperse the apparition you have manifested as a familiar, the familiar is destroyed.
