# Unwind Death `pf2:3`
## Feat 16
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Clockwork Reanimator Dedication
* * *
**Requirements** The target's body must be mostly intact.

* * *

Combining necromancy with the mysterious temporal powers of clockwork, you wind a creature backward from the moment of its death. Attempt a `DC 40 Crafting check` check to revive a dead creature that has been dead for no more than 3 rounds. If you succeed, the target returns to life with the effects of [[Spells/Raise Dead|Raise Dead]], except it still has the wounded condition it had before dying, increased by 1 (or wounded 1 if it wasn't wounded before dying). Whether you succeed or fail, the target is then temporarily immune to Unwind Death for 1 day.
