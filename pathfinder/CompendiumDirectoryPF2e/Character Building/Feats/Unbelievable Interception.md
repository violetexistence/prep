# Unbelievable Interception `pf2:r`
## Feat 8
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[mythic]]

**Category** class; 




**Trigger** An enemy you're observing attempts to Strike an ally you can also observe.

* * *

You move with unbelievable alacrity to intercept an enemy's attack. Spend a Mythic Point; stride twice directly toward the triggering enemy. If you end within the attack's range or reach, you become the target of the triggering Strike, using the original attack roll and comparing the result to your AC. If the enemy's attack fails and the enemy is within your reach, you can immediately attempt a melee Strike against the enemy at mythic proficiency.
