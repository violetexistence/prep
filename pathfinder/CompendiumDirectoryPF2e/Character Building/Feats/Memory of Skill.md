Your years of training in a previous life didn't go to waste with your death, and you can call upon this training when you most need it. Choose one skill. You temporarily increase your proficiency rank with that skill by one step for 1 minute (from untrained to trained, trained to expert, and expert to master). This temporary increase adjusts your proficiency bonus and allows you to use skill actions based on this increased proficiency as normal. Memory of Skill can't increase a skill's proficiency rank beyond master.
