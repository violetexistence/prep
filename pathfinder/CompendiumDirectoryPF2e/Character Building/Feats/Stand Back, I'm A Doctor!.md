# Stand Back, I'm A Doctor! `pf2:2`
## Feat 12
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Lepidstadt Surgeon Dedication; master in Medicine
* * *
**Requirements** You are holding healer's tools, or you are wearing them and have a hand free; a creature with the [[Conditions/Dying|Dying]] condition is in your reach.

* * *

You have mastered techniques to aid those at the brink of death, even if they use dangerous Stasian technology. Attempt a Medicine check on the dying creature as you deliver it a powerful shock. The DC is usually a standard-difficulty DC of a level equal to the target. On a success, the creature's dying condition is reduced by 1 (or 2 on a critical success); if this reduces the value of the dying condition to 0, the creature regains 2d8+10 healing Hit Points, its wounded condition doesn't increase, and it can Stand as a free action. Each creature except you adjacent to the target takes 8d6 electricity damage (`Reflex check` save against your class DC or spell DC); instead of attempting this save, a creature can Step as a free action and if they end this movement not adjacent to the target, they take no damage.
