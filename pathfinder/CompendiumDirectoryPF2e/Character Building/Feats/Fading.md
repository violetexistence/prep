# Fading `pf2:r`
## Feat 10
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[archetype]][[teleportation]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Crimson Shroud
* * *
**Frequency** once per [[Feats/Crimson Shroud|Crimson Shroud]]

**Trigger** You are targeted with a Strike by someone you can detect.

**Requirements** Your Crimson Shroud is active.

* * *

You partially fade from reality. The attacker must attempt a `DC 11 Flat check`; on a failure, the attack passes harmlessly through the image of your body that remains behind. An instant later you return to reality, and your Crimson Shroud ends.
