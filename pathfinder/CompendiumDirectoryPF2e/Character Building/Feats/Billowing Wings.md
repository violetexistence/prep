# Billowing Wings
## Feat 12
### [[air]][[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Beastmaster Dedication; animal companion with wings
* * *
You've trained your winged companions to gather air in their wings, whipping up a concentrated gust of wind at opponents, potentially staggering them. Your companions with wings gain a gust ranged unarmed attack, which deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage with a range of 30 feet and has the air and propulsive traits. On a critical hit, the target is pushed back 5 feet. This is forced movement.
