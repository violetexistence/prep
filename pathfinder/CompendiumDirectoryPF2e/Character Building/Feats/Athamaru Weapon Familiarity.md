# Athamaru Weapon Familiarity
## Feat 1
### [[athamaru]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You wield weapons designed to work underwater with ease. You have familiarity with weapons with the athamaru trait and with crossbows, heavy crossbows, longspears, spears, and tridentsâ€”for the purposes of proficiency, you treat any of these that are martial weapons as simple weapons.

At 5th level, whenever you get a critical hit with one of these weapons, you get its critical specialization effect.
