# Exalted Greatness
## Feat 14
### [[champion]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** exalted reaction
* * *
You improve your exalted reaction with the benefit listed for your cause.

**Desecration** While you have the benefit, you also gain a +2 status bonus to saving throws against effects created by enemies in your champion's aura.

**Grandeur** Any _revealing light_ created by your [[Actions/Flash of Grandeur|Flash of Grandeur]] lasts for 1 minute.

**Iniquity** The damage dealt to enemies other than the triggering creatures increases by an amount equal to the damage dice of [[Actions/Destructive Vengeance|Destructive Vengeance]] (apply this after you halve the damage).

**Justice** The penalty is –2 instead of –5.

**Liberation** You and all affected allies can attempt to break free, not just the triggering ally.

**Obedience** The damage dealt to creatures other than the triggering creature who refuse to drop [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] increases to half the damage the triggering creature would take (roll the damage only once for all affected creatures).

**Redemption** The resistance isn't reduced.
