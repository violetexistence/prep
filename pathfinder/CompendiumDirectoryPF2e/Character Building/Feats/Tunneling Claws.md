# Tunneling Claws
## Feat 12
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Ghoul Dedication; trained in Athletics
* * *
You have elongated claws and enhanced senses, making you uncanny at digging the underground passageways needed to construct ghoul warrens and rob graves without arousing suspicion. You gain a burrow Speed of 15 feet and a tremorsense (imprecise) of 60 feet. You can [[Actions/Burrow|Burrow]] through any earthen matter, including rock, while moving at your full burrow Speed. When you move in this way, you can choose either to leave tunnels behind you that are large enough to allow creatures of your size or smaller to move through them or move through the ground while leaving no tunnels or signs of your passing.
