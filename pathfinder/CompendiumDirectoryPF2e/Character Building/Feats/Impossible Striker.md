**Prerequisites** Sly Striker

Nothing can prevent you from making a sneak attack, even if your opponent can see every blow coming. Instead of dealing the damage from [[Feats/Sly Striker|Sly Striker]], you can deal your full sneak attack damage to a target even if the target isn't [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]].
