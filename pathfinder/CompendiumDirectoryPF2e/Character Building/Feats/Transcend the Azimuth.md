# Transcend the Azimuth
## Feat 17
### [[primal]][[yaksha]]

**Category** ancestry; 




As the earth drinks the light of sun and moon, so does your steady vow imbibe superlunary forces, ready to be unleashed with a moment's mantra. You can cast [[Spells/Cosmic Form|Cosmic Form]] on yourself as a 7th-rank primal innate spell once per day, your shadow lengthening and becoming a mandala of fundamental energies. In addition to the spell's normal effects, you can Sustain the spell to switch between the sun battle form and the moon battle form once per turn.
