# Reveal Beasts
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** bonus; 



**Prerequisites** Order of the Nail
* * *
You are adept at revealing—or creating—weaknesses among those who are a threat to civilization. If you roll a success on a check to [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] to identify an animal or a beast, you get a critical success instead. The next time you damage that creature, it gains weakness 5 during that attack to one damage type of your choice that you dealt it.
