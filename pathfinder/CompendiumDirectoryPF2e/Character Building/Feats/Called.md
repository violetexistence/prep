# Called
## Feat 5
### [[changeling]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You've heard the Call, and by resisting it, you've developed a bulwark against effects that target your mind. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Will saving throws against mental effects. If you roll a success on your saving throw against a mental effect that would make you [[Conditions/Controlled|Controlled]], you get a critical success instead.
