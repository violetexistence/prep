# Open the Blazing Eye `pf2:2`
## Feat 10
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Palatine Detective Dedication
* * *
**Frequency** once per day

* * *

Thanks to your diligence in the study of divine and occult mysteries, you can focus to temporarily attain a perception beyond the ordinary. A lightless flame appears in the center of your forehead. For 1 minute, you gain the benefits of a [[Spells/See the Unseen|See the Unseen]] spell.

In addition, when you attempt a Strike during this time against a creature about which you could Recall Knowledge using Occultism or Religion, the attack ignores circumstance penalties to the attack roll and any flat check required due to the target being [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] or [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]].
