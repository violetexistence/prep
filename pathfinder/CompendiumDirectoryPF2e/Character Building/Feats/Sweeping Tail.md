# Sweeping Tail
## Feat 10
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Beastmaster Dedication; animal companion with a tail unarmed attack
* * *
Your companion swings its tail powerfully. Your companions with a qualifying unarmed attack learn the Sweeping Tail activity.

**Sweeping Tail** `pf2:2` This companion makes two tail Strikes against different creatures within its reach, increasing its multiple attack penalty as normal. On a hit, it pushes a target back 5 feet or 10 feet on a critical hit. This is forced movement.
