# Riftmarked
## Feat 1
### [[lineage]][[nephilim]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Long ago, qlippoth marked someone in your lineage, most likely through their ancient runestones that dot Golarion's surface. Yours is an old lineage, primordial and twisted, and you have a sense for similarly twisted things. You're trained in Occultism. If you're already trained in Occultism (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also gain the [[Feats/Oddity Identification|Oddity Identification]] skill feat.

_Note: If you are already trained in the skill provided by this feat, you need to manually select an alternative skill. You also need to manually enter the granted Lore skill._
