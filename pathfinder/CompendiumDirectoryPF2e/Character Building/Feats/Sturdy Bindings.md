# Sturdy Bindings
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** bonus; 



**Prerequisites** Order of the Chain

Your grapples are incredibly reliable. When you roll a critical failure on a check to [[Actions/Grapple|Grapple]] a target, you get a failure instead. In addition, when a creature you have grabbed rolls a failure on its check to [[Actions/Escape|Escape]], it gets a critical failure instead, and if it rolls a critical success, it gets a success instead.
