## Feat 12
### [[thaumaturge]]

**Category** class; 




**Frequency** once per 10 minutes

Your bond to your invested items enables you to put more of yourself into them. If you next action is to activate an invested item that has a saving throw DC, you can use your thaumaturge class DC instead of the item's DC if it is higher.
