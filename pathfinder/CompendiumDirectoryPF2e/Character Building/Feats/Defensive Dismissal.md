# Defensive Dismissal `pf2:r`
## Feat 12
### [[druid]]

**Category** class; 




**Trigger** A creature you're aware of critically succeeds on a Strike against you.

**Requirements** You're under a polymorph effect that you can Dismiss.

* * *

You change your form as a means of evading a potentially fatal blow. You Dismiss the polymorph effect you're under, and the result of the triggering Strike becomes a success instead of a critical success. If you would no longer fit in your space as a result of returning to your normal form, this action fails and you don't Dismiss the polymorph effect.
