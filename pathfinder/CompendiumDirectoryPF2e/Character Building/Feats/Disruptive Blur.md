# Disruptive Blur
## Feat 14
### [[gunslinger]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** way of the drifter
* * *
You use cacophonous blasts from your gun or distracting shots from your crossbow to cause momentary diversions, letting you move about the battlefield with impunity. After you make a Strike with a firearm or crossbow, creatures can't take reactions that would be triggered by your movement for the rest of your turn.
