# Homing Shot `pf2:1`
## Feat 14
### [[archetype]][[magical]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Eldritch Archer Dedication
* * *
Your shots zip around corners and fly at impossible angles to reach your target.

Make a bow or crossbow Strike against a foe you can see; the ammunition travels to your target, even going around corners. You ignore the target's [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] condition and all cover.
