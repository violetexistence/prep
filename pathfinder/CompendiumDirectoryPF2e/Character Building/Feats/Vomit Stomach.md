# Vomit Stomach `pf2:r`
## Feat 5
### [[grippli]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Trigger** You gain the [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened]] condition or fail a saving throw against an ingested poison.

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

In dire circumstances you can vomit out your stomach to expel toxins. Reduce your sickened condition by 2 and immediately attempt a saving throw with a +2 circumstance bonus against any ingested poisons you have been exposed to within the last minute. You become [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] for 1 round as your exposed stomach makes you especially vulnerable to attacks.
