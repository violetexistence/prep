# Experienced Professional
## Feat 1
### [[general]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Lore
* * *
You carefully safeguard your professional endeavors to prevent disaster. When you use Lore to [[Actions/Earn Income|Earn Income]], if you roll a critical failure, you instead get a failure. If you're an expert in Lore, you gain twice as much income from a failed check to Earn Income, unless it was originally a critical failure.
