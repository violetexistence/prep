# Awakened Magic
## Feat 1
### [[awakened-animal]]

**Category** ancestry; 




When you awakened, primal magic was released within you. Choose one cantrip from the primal spell list. You can cast this spell as an primal innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell rank equal to half your level rounded up.
