# Irresistible Magic
## Feat 6
### [[wizard]]

**Category** class; 




You've studied ways of overcoming the innate defenses against magic that dragons, otherworldly beings, and certain other powerful creatures have. Any creature that has a status bonus to saving throws against magic reduces that bonus by 1 against your spells.
