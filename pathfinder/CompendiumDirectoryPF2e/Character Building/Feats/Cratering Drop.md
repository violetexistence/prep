## Feat 14
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Pluck from the Sky
* * *
**Requirements** Your previous action was Pluck from the Sky using a melee Strike, and the target failed or critically failed its saving throw.

You follow up your enemy's fall, driving you both to the earth in a meteoric descent. You Fly straight down, increasing the amount the enemy falls by your Fly speed. If you reach the ground, you drive the enemy into the ground, dealing double the normal falling damage.
