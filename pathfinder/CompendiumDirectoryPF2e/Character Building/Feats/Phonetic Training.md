# Phonetic Training
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** Linguist Dedication; expert in Society
* * *
You can pronounce and repeat words with near-perfect accuracy even if you don't understand their meaning, and you can write them down in a phonetic script that allows you or another creature with Phonetic Training to read it later. Even if the words are in a language with sound you can't pronounce, you can faithfully transcribe them. Memorizing long sequences of words remains just as difficult as it is normally.
