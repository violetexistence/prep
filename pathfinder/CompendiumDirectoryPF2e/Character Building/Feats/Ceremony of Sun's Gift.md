# Ceremony of Sun's Gift
## Feat 17
### [[conrasu]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Your connection to the sun has become an unbreakable bond. You don't become temporarily immune to the effects of your [[Ancestry Features/Sunlight Healing|Sunlight Healing]], and instead of rolling to recover Hit Points, you gain the maximum number of HP possible (for example, 64 HP instead of 8d8).
