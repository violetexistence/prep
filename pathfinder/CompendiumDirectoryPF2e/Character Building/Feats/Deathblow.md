# Deathblow `pf2:2`
## Feat 16
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Guerrilla Dedication; Poisoned Sticks and Stones
* * *
Your carefully prepared and placed shot brings instant death to your target. Attempt a Strike with a blowgun or sling using ammunition that you have poisoned with your simple injury poison. If the Strike is successful and you are [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] from the target, or unnoticed or undetected by them, the target must succeed at a `Fortitude check` save against your class DC or die; this is a death and incapacitation effect. A creature that survives is temporarily immune to the instant death effect of Deathblow for 1 day.
