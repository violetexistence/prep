# Powerful Shove
## Feat 4
### [[fighter]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Aggressive Block or Brutish Shove
* * *
You can push larger foes around with your attack. You can use [[Feats/Aggressive Block|Aggressive Block]] or [[Feats/Brutish Shove|Brutish Shove]] against a creature up to two sizes larger than you.

When a creature you Shove or knock back with a shield, polearm, or club's critical specialization effect has to stop moving because it would hit an object, it takes damage equal to your Strength modifier (minimum 1).
