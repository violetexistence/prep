# Talent Envy
## Feat 7
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[general]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** expert in Performance; Virtuosic Performer
* * *
You give off a bedazzling glow with every performance, sparking feelings of severe envy and inadequacy in those who compare their talent to yours. Once per minute when you succeed at a check using the type of performance that you chose with Virtuosic Performer, you can attempt to [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] an onlooker of your choice within 60 feet as a free action. If you critically succeeded on your Performance check, improve the degree of success for your Demoralize check by one step.
