# Performer's Treatment
## Feat 2
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[general]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** expert in Medicine; expert in Performance
* * *
With your experience as a performer, you can keep a set of medical tools handy at all times. You can wear a healer's toolkit as part of any costume or disguise. Creatures will generally only notice the toolkit it if they use a [[Actions/Seek|Seek]] action and succeed at a `Perception check` check against your Performance DC. In addition, you can realize at the last moment when you should just be pretending to avoid doing any lasting harm.

When you critically fail a Medicine check to Administer First Aid, [[Actions/Treat Disease|Treat Disease]], [[Actions/Treat Poison|Treat Poison]], or [[Actions/Treat Wounds|Treat Wounds]], you can attempt a `Performance check` check against the patient's Perception DC. On a success, your critical failure at the Medicine check becomes a failure.
