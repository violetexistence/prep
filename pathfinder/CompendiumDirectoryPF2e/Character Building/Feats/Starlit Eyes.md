# Starlit Eyes
## Feat 4
### [[magus]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Arcane Cascade; starlit span hybrid study
* * *
Starlight shines in your sight, enhancing your perception and range.

When you make a ranged Strike while in Arcane Cascade stance, you lower the DC of your flat check to target a creature that's [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] or [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] from you. The DC is reduced to 3 instead of 5 against a concealed creature and to 9 instead of 11 against a hidden one.

When you cast shooting star and target a hidden creature, you don't have to attempt the flat check for targeting a hidden creature with a ranged Strike.
