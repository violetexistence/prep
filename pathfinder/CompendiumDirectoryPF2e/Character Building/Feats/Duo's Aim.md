### [[archetype]][[concentrate]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Sniping Duo Dedication
* * *
With assistance from your spotter, you aim for an especially accurate attack. Make a crossbow or firearm Strike against a foe either within your spotter's melee reach or the first range increment of a ranged weapon your spotter is wielding. On this Strike, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the attack roll and ignore the target's concealment. If you're using a firearm with the kickback trait, you don't take the normal circumstance penalty to this Strike for not having the required Strength modifier or firing without using a tripod.
