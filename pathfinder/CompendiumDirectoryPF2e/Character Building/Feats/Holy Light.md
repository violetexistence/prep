**Prerequisites** you follow a good-aligned deity

You raise your arms to the sky and pray fervently, surrounding yourself in a beacon of holy light. The beacon sheds bright light in a 30-foot-radius, 100-foot-high cylinder centered on you until the beginning of your next turn. Evil creatures in the area must succeed at a `Will check` save equal to your class DC or spell DC (whichever is higher) or become [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] for 1 round.
