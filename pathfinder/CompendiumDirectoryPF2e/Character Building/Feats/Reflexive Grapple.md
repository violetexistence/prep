# Reflexive Grapple `pf2:1`
## Feat 12
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Thlipit Contestant Dedication
* * *
You've honed your reflexes so well that your lash can begin closing around a target as soon as it makes contact. Make a lash Strike; if the Strike hits, you can immediately attempt to [[Actions/Grapple|Grapple]] the target. Both actions count toward your multiple attack penalty, but don't increase your penalty until you've made both attacks.
