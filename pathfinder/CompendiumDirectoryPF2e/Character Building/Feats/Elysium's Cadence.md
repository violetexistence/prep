## Feat 6
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[aftermath]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** You've partied extensively with an azata or entered a romantic relationship with an azata
* * *
You've been ensnared by an azata's infectious enthusiasm for life, love, and freedom that manifests as a pearlescent afterimage in your graceful movements, a spring in your soft steps, an ever-present melody in your euphonic voice, and eddies of passionate colors in your mesmerizing eyes. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]], or a +2 circumstance bonus if the target is chaotic good. You gain the [[Actions/Set Free|Set Free]] reaction.
