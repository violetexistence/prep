# Slayer's Presence
## Feat 10
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Frighten Undead
* * *
Your very presence strikes fear into the undead. When you use [[Actions/Slayer's Identification|Slayer's Identification]] and succeed at your check, you can [[Feats/Frighten Undead|Frighten Undead]] as a free action, targeting the creature you identified. Any time you get a critical success to Frighten Undead, if the target's level is lower than yours, the target is [[Conditions/Fleeing|Fleeing]] for 1 round.
