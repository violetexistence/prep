Your eidolon adapts to life on land and underwater. It gains the amphibious trait, allowing it to breathe in water and air and to avoid the normal -2 penalty for making bludgeoning and slashing unarmed Strikes underwater. It gains a swim Speed equal to its land Speed or 25 feet, whichever is less; or if it is normally aquatic, it gains a land Speed equal to its swim Speed or 25 feet, whichever is less.
