## Feat 6
### [[wizard]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** expert in Deception

**Trigger** A creature succeeded, but didn't critically succeed, at a Perception check or Will save to disbelieve an illusion from a spell that you cast.

**Requirements** You are within 30 feet of the observer and the illusion.

You use your deceptive skills to make your illusions seem even more real. Attempt a `Deception check` check against the target's Perception DC. If you succeed, the target fails to disbelieve the illusion.
