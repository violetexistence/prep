# Wing Buffet `pf2:2`
## Feat 9
### [[attack]][[dragonblood]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** expert in Athletics
* * *
You have a pair of draconic wings strong enough to batter your foes away and shove them away. Choose up to two creatures adjacent to you. Attempt an `Athletics check` check and compare it to the Fortitude DC of each target. This counts as two attacks for your multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after both attacks.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target takes bludgeoning damage equal to double your level (2 bludgeoning) and is pushed up to 10 feet away from you.

**Success** The target takes bludgeoning damage equal to your level (1 bludgeoning) and is pushed up to 5 feet away from you.

**Failure** The target takes bludgeoning damage equal to half your level (0 bludgeoning).

**Critical Failure** You fall [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] at the end of this activity.
