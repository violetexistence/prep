# Grand Metamorphosis
## Feat 9
### [[surki]]

**Category** ancestry; 




One of your nodes has adapted into a new magic-emitting organ. You gain one of the evolutions from your surki heritage. If you have multiple heritages, you choose one to evolve.

**Special** You can take this feat multiple times, gaining a new evolution each time. The evolution can be for a heritage you've already evolved or a different one.
