Your desire for stimulation has led you from one pursuit to another and granted you a smattering of expertise with myriad crafts and professions. You reflect on snippets you've learned to temporarily become trained in one Lore skill of your choice. This proficiency lasts for 10 minutes or until you critically fail a check with that skill. Since this training is temporary, you can't use it as a prerequisite for a permanent character option like a feat or a skill increase.
