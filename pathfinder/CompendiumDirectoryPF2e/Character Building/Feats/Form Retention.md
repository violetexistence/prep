# Form Retention
## Feat 8
### [[wizard]]

**Category** class; 




You have trained your mind and body to tolerate polymorph magic for longer periods of time, so long as you prepare for the change appropriately. When preparing a polymorph spell that lasts 1 minute and grants a battle form, you can prepare the spell in a slot 2 ranks higher than normal. This doesn't grant any of the normal benefits of heightening a spell, but the spell lasts up to 10 minutes. For example, if you prepared animal form in a 4th-rank slot with Form Retention, you would cast a 2nd-rank [[Spells/Animal Form|Animal Form]] that lasts for up to 10 minutes. If the spell can be Dismissed, that doesn't change.
