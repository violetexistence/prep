# Seeker of Truths
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Eldritch Researcher Dedication
* * *
Your devotion to discovering and hoarding abstruse truths borders on the fanatical, and you can bring this devotion to bear. You gain the cleric's [[Feats/Domain Initiate|Domain Initiate]] feat but must select knowledge, secrecy, or truth as your domain. You cast that domain's domain spell as a focus spell of the same tradition as your cantrip from Eldritch Researcher Dedication, and you Refocus by contemplating abstruse mysteries rather than praying to a god. When an ability would manifest a divine symbol—such as the [[Spells/Word of Truth|Word of Truth]] focus spell—it instead manifests as a strange shape unique to you that seems to defy geometry.

* * *

**Special** You can take this feat up to three times, selecting a different domain each time.
