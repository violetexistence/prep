# Too Much to Swallow `pf2:r`
## Feat 16
### [[druid]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Untamed Form
* * *
**Trigger** You're subject to an effect you could attempt to [[Actions/Escape|Escape]].

* * *

While you might be small enough to grab normally, you can change that at a moment's notice. You cast [[Spells/Untamed Form|Untamed Form]]. If you took on a new form that's too large for the effect, you automatically escape. Otherwise, you attempt to Escape. If this ends an effect where you entered the creature's space, such as [[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Swallow Whole|Swallow Whole]], exit that creature to an adjacent area where your new form could fit.
