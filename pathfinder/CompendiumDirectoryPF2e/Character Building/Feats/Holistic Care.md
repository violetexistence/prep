# Holistic Care
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Diplomacy; Treat Condition
* * *
You provide emotional and spiritual care. Add [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened]], [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied]], and [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned]] to the list of conditions you can reduce with [[Feats/Treat Condition|Treat Condition]]. If the stunned condition has a duration instead of a value, you can't use Treat Condition to reduce it.
