# Unravel Mysteries
## Feat 8
### [[archetype]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** master in a Decipher Writing skill; Scrollmaster Dedication
* * *
You can understand the true meaning of texts quickly, and even when you get lost or hit a dead end, you aren't discouraged from making further attempts to get to the bottom of things. When you Decipher Writing, you need only half as long as usual (reducing the time from about 1 minute to about half a minute per page), and if you fail, you don't take the usual -2 circumstance penalty to further checks to decipher that text.
