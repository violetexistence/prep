# Corpse Stench
## Feat 12
### [[archetype]][[aura]][[olfactory]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Ghoul Dedication
* * *
Your body exudes an overwhelming scent of decay in a 10-foot emanation, so putrid that it nauseates creates within that range. Any creature that starts its turn in the aura must succeed at a `Fortitude check` save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher, or be [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] (plus [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] on a critical failure). While within the aura, the creature takes a -2 circumstance penalty to saves against disease and to recover from the sickened condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune to Corpse Stench for 1 minute.
