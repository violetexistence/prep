# Circle of Spirits `pf2:1`
## Feat 1
### [[animist]][[apparition]][[concentrate]]

**Category** class; 




**Frequency** once per round

* * *

With a thought, word, or gesture, you reach your mind out to another spirit. Choose another apparition from among those you've attuned to; it becomes your primary apparition, replacing your current one.

* * *

**Special** The number of Focus Points in your focus pool is equal to the number of focus spells you have or the number of apparitions you are attuned to, whichever is higher (maximum 3).
