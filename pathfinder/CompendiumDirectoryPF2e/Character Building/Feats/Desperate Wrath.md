# Desperate Wrath `pf2:0`
## Feat 16
### [[barbarian]][[rage]]

**Category** class; 




**Trigger** Your turn begins, and your current Hit Points are at half your maximum or less.

* * *

Your blood boils when you take a beating, and you throw caution to the wind to finish the fight. You get a +2 circumstance bonus to attack rolls, a –1 penalty to AC, and a –1 penalty to saves. These bonuses and penalties last until your Rage ends or until you are above half Hit Points, whichever comes first.
