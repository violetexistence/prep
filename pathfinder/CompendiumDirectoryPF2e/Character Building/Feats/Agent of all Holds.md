# Agent of all Holds
## Feat 2
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Tattooed Historian Dedication
* * *
**Trigger** You critically fail a Diplomacy, Intimidation, or Performance check.

* * *

Orcs across Belkzen recognize you as an honored lorekeeper. You're adept at leveraging this status and showing off your tattoos to resolve conflicts, change minds, or distract others from a faux pas. You get a failure on the check, rather than a critical failure. If the triggering check was made against a creature with the orc trait, you can instead add the fortune trait to this ability and reroll the check, treating any critical failure as a failure.
