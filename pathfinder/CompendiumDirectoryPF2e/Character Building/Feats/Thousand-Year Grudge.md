# Thousand-Year Grudge `pf2:r`
## Feat 5
### [[occult]][[samsaran]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** You succeed at a [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] check.

* * *

You can call upon your former lives and project all of your accumulated frustration, failure, and despair through your eyes at a target, overwhelming their senses. One creature you successfully Demoralized becomes [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened]] instead of frightened, with the same condition value. The DC to recover from the sickened condition is your Intimidation DC.
