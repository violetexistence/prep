# Lab Rat
## Feat 5
### [[ratfolk]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You've spent more than your share of time in an alchemy lab. You have been exposed to a wide variety of alchemical poisons and harmful substances, leaving you with an increased tolerance of their effects. You have a +1 circumstance bonus to saves against poisons and diseases. If you roll a success on your saving throw against a poison or disease, you get a critical success instead.
