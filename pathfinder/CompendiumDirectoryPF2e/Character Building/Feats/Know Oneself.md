# Know Oneself `pf2:r`
## Feat 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[fortune]][[human]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per day

**Access** Vudrani ethnicity

**Trigger** You roll a critical failure on a saving throw against an emotion effect.

You center yourself and call to mind the Vudrani monastic ideals of mindfulness and self-knowledge. You fail the save against the emotion effect instead of critically failing.
