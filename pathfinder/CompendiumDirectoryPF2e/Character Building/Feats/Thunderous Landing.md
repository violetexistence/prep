# Thunderous Landing `pf2:1`
## Feat 12
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Winged Warrior Dedication
* * *
**Requirements** You currently have a fly Speed and are airborne.

* * *

You hurl away enemies with the force of your landing. You Fly and, if you end your movement on a solid surface, your landing sends out a shock wave of air. Each creature within 10 feet of your landing position must succeed at a `Reflex check` save against your class DC or be pushed 10 feet away. This is forced movement.
