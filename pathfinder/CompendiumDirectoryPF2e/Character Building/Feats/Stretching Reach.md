# Stretching Reach `pf2:1`
## Feat 5
### [[minotaur]][[stance]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You can leverage your size and muscle to extend your reach and attack more distant foes. While in this stance, when you wield a melee weapon that requires two hands and doesn't have reach, the weapon gains a reach of 10 feet.
