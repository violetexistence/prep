# Domain Embodiment
## Feat 14
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 




Your deity contains multitudes, and you can express any aspect of them you desire. During your daily preparations, you can gain two initial or advanced domain spells from any of your deity's domains or alternate domains. You can cast these as innate spells until your next daily preparations.

Domain spells are a type of focus spell. Casting any of your focus spells costs you 1 Focus Point. The maximum number of Focus Points in your pool is equal to the number of focus spells you know or 3, whichever is lower. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to pray to your deity or do service toward their causes. Your domain spells are divine spells. If you were not already, you become trained in spell attacks and spell DCs. Your spellcasting attribute for domain spells is Wisdom.
