### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Harrower Dedication

When you perform the [[Spells/Harrowing|Harrowing]] ritual, the DC for the Primary Check is never more than the standard DC by level, and the cost for the ritual is halved. If you use a fine harrow deck, the cost for the ritual is removed entirely.
