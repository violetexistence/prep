# Soulsight (Sorcerer)
## Feat 8
### [[sorcerer]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** bloodline that grants divine or occult spells
* * *
The spiritual essence in your blood has opened your senses to the world beyond. You gain spiritsense as an imprecise sense with a range of 60 feet.

Spiritsense enables you to sense the spirits of creatures, including living creatures, most non-mindless undead, and haunts within the listed range. As with your hearing and other imprecise senses, you still need to [[Actions/Seek|Seek]] to locate an undetected creature.

As spiritsense detects spiritual essence, not physical bodies, it can detect spirits projected by spells such as [[Spells/Project Image|Project Image]] or possessing otherwise soulless objects. It can't detect soulless bodies, constructs, or objects, and like most senses, it doesn't penetrate through solid objects.
