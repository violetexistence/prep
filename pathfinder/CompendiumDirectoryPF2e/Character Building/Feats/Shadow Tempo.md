# Shadow Tempo `pf2:r`
## Feat 9
### [[wayang]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Trigger** An ally within your reach uses a move action or leaves a square during a move action they're using.

* * *

As your ally moves past you, you match your movements to their rhythm, following them across the battlefield. You Stride up to your Speed but must follow the same path that the triggering ally takes. You must end your movement adjacent to the triggering ally (or in the last square you were able to move if your ally is able to move farther than your Speed).
