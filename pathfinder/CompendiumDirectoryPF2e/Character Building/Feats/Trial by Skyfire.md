* * *
Your lips murmur as you portend a great disaster, one you hope you survive. A rain of blazing bolts begins to fall from the heavens in a 10-foot emanation, centered on you, that deals 2d6 fire damage to all creatures in the emanation at the end of each of your turns (`Reflex check` save); you can't exclude yourself from the emanation. The skyfire persists for 1 minute; while you can't Dismiss it, you can suppress the effect for 1 round with a Sustain action. The rain of fire is suppressed if you fall [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]]. If you become [[Conditions/Cursebound|Cursebound 3]] or 4 at any point during Trial by Skyfire's duration, the emanation increases to 15 feet and the damage increases to 4d6 fire.
