# Ride
## Feat 1
### [[general]]

**Category** general; 




When you [[Actions/Command an Animal|Command an Animal]] you're mounted on to take a move action (such as Stride), you automatically succeed instead of needing to attempt a check. Any animal you're mounted on acts on your turn, like a minion. If you [[Actions/Mount|Mount]] an animal in the middle of an encounter, it skips its next turn and then acts on your next turn.
