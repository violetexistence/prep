# Rolling White Bottle Form `pf2:r`
## Feat 9
### [[tanuki]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Teakettle Form
* * *
**Trigger** You Drop Prone or otherwise become [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]].

* * *

As you fall to the ground, you transform into a white bottle, gourd, or sake jar, then roll away before anyone can pick you up. You [[Actions/Crawl|Crawl]] up to two times, and your movement doesn't provoke reactionsâ€”you somehow always roll just out of reach. When you come to a stop, you return to your tanuki form, face down on the ground.
