# Scouring Rage `pf2:0`
## Feat 6
### [[barbarian]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** an instinct that allows you to change your additional damage from Rage to a different damage type
* * *
**Trigger** You [[Actions/Rage|Rage]].

You emit a powerful surge of instinctual energy when you unleash your anger. Each enemy within 20 feet takes damage equal to your level (`Fortitude check` save against your class DC) of the same type as your additional damage during that Rage.
