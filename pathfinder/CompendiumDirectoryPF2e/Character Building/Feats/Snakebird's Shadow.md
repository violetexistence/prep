# Snakebird's Shadow `pf2:2`
## Feat 8
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[flourish]][[monk]][[occult]][[water]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Waterfowl Stance
* * *
**Requirements** You are in Waterfowl Stance and are wielding a monk weapon from the sword group.

Ganhil developed this technique through observing the sharp-beaked darters fishing Prada Hanam's waters, seeking to match their speed and suppleness with the elemental flash of his blade. Make a melee Strike with the required weapon against each enemy in a 15-foot line as razor-sharp shadows of water surge from your blade. Each attack counts toward your multiple attack penalty, but you do not increase your penalty until you have made all your attacks.
