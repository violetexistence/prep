# Parthenogenic Hatchling
## Feat 1
### [[lizardfolk]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You were hatched from an unfertilized egg during hard times for your people, and are a biological copy of your mother. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against diseases. If you roll a success on a saving throw against a disease, you get a critical success instead. If you have a different ability that would improve the save in this way (such as the [[Class Features/Battle Hardened|Battle Hardened]] fighter class feature), if you roll a critical failure on the save you get a failure instead.

You take damage only every 2 hours from thirst and every 2 days from starvation, rather than every hour and every day.

**Special** You can select this feat only at 1st level.
