# Sacred Ground
## Feat 4
### [[cleric]][[consecration]][[divine]][[exploration]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** harmful font or healing font
* * *
**Frequency** once per 10 minutes

* * *

You pray continuously for 1 minute to call a subtle shadow of your deity's realm over a 30-foot burst centered on you. It lasts for 10 minutes, and a creature that remains in the area for the entire 10 minutes regains Hit Points equal to your level. If you have a healing font, this activity has the healing and vitality traits and heals living creatures. If you have a harmful font, this activity has the healing and void traits and heals undead creatures (or other creatures with void healing). Clerics with Versatile Font can choose either or both. It can't damage creatures in any case.
