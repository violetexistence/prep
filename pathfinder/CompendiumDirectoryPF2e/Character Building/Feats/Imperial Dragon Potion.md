# Imperial Dragon Potion
## Feat 13
### [[kobold]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** heavenscribe kobold heritage; expert in Crafting
* * *
During your daily preparations, you can spend 10 minutes to create a variant _energy breath potion_, which has the kobold trait in addition to its normal traits. The variant potion is influenced by imperial dragon magic, granting it the effect corresponding to your dragon benefactor; the DC for the breath is the higher of your class DC or spell DC. The potion becomes inert if not used by your next daily preparations, so it has no value if sold.
