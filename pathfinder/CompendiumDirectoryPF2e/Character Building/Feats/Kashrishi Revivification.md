# Kashrishi Revivification `pf2:0`
## Feat 13
### [[kashrishi]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** You have the dying condition and are about to attempt a recovery check. You can use Kashrishi Revivification even if you're otherwise unable to act.

* * *

The well of psychic energy held within your mind can exceed the limitations of your physical body. You're restored to 1 Hit Point, lose the dying and [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]] conditions, and can act normally on this turn. You gain or increase the wounded condition as normal for losing the dying condition.
