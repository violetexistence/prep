# Fossil Rider
## Feat 17
### [[lizardfolk]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Bone Magic
* * *
Using your ancestors' bones, you manifest their spirits around you in a fossilized form. You can cast [[Spells/Mask of Terror|Mask of Terror]] on yourself as an innate spell once per day. When you do, you appear as a skeletal lizardfolk ancestor, twisted in a way that inspires the deepest fears of those who observe you.
