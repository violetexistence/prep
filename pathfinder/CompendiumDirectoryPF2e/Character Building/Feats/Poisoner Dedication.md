**Prerequisites** trained in Crafting

You make a point of always having a few toxins near at handâ€”you never know when some arsenic or the like might prove useful. You gain the [[PF2e Journals/Archetypes/advanced alchemy benefits|advanced alchemy benefits]]. You can use advanced alchemy to create four alchemical poison consumables each day. You remember alchemical poison formulas and don't need a formula book for them.
