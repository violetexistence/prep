## Feat 5
### [[jotunborn]][[stance]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You emulate the battle stance of your forebears, allowing you to use mighty weapons to attack distant foes. While in this stance, when you wield a melee weapon that requires two hands and doesn't have reach, the weapon gains a reach of 10 feet.
