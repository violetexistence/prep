# Like a Roach
## Feat 1
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[downtime]][[reincarnated]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Living with the bare necessities isn't terribly hard for someone who has defied death, and like a cockroach, you always know how to survive. When you [[Actions/Subsist|Subsist]] during downtime, the DC for your skill check is reduced by 2. You don't need a minimum proficiency rank to Subsist in unusual environments, nor do you take a â€“5 penalty if you Subsist after 8 hours or less of exploration.
