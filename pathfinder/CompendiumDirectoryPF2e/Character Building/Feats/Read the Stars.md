# Read the Stars
## Feat 9
### [[lizardfolk]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Astrology Lore or Occultism
* * *
You're incredibly skilled in iruxi astrology, and you can gain useful (if cryptic) hints from the stars' alignment. Once per night, if you can clearly see the stars, you can spend 1 hour reading the heavens to see how they relate to a particular goal, event, or activity that will occur within 1 week. The GM rolls a secret check, either a DC 28 Astrology Lore check or a DC 32 Occultism check. On a success, you learn a cryptic clue or piece of advice that could help with the chosen event, and on a critical failure, you learn a misleading cryptic clue or piece of advice.
