# Pistol Phenom Dedication
## Feat 2
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[archetype]][[dedication]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** trained in at least one type of one-handed firearm; trained in Deception; trained in Performance
* * *
You catch an opponent [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] by spinning your weapon. You gain the Pistol Twirl gunslinger feat, enabling you to [[Actions/Feint|Feint]] against creatures within your weapon's first range increment. This otherwise serves as [[Feats/Pistol Twirl|Pistol Twirl]] for the purpose of meeting prerequisites, although as normal, it doesn't count as another pistol phenom feat for the purpose of meeting Pistol Phenom Dedication's special entry and taking another archetype. Whenever you Feint with a one-handed firearm, you can choose to attempt a [[Actions/feint skill=performance|feint skill=performance]]{Performance} check instead of a Deception check.
