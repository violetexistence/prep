# Sudden Mindfulness `pf2:r`
## Feat 1
### [[vanara]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Trigger** You roll a success on a saving throw against an effect that would make you [[Conditions/Fascinated|Fascinated]] or [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]].

* * *

Your mind retains full awareness despite the best attempts of others, and your focus throws others off-balance. You get a critical success on the triggering saving throw, and if the triggering effect was caused by a creature, that creature is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] to you until the end of your next turn.
