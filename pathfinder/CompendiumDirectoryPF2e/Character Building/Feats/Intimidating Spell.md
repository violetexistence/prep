The devastation wrought by your large-scale spells is particularly terrifying. If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell that deals damage in an area, any target who fails their saving throw is also [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]] (or [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] on a critical failure).
