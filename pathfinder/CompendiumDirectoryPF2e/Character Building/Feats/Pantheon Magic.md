# Pantheon Magic
## Feat 1
### [[minotaur]]

**Category** ancestry; 




The touch of divine meddling still runs through you, whether you want it or not. Choose one cantrip from the divine spell list. You can cast this cantrip as a divine innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell rank equal to half your level rounded up.
