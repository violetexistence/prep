**Prerequisites** Vampire Dedication

Through a profane pledge or a bloodline quirk, you can tolerate the sun's light. You gain the [[Ancestry Features/Advanced Undead Benefits|Advanced Undead Benefits]] and can't be destroyed by sunlight. This doesn't prevent you from becoming [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed]] by exposure to the sun.
