# Seasong
## Feat 1
### [[merfolk]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Sound carries far beneath the waves, and your people have strong, enchanting voices. You become trained in Performance. If you would automatically become trained in Performance (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. In addition, you gain the [[Feats/Virtuosic Performer|Virtuosic Performer]] skill feat for singing, and your voice carries equally well above and below water.
