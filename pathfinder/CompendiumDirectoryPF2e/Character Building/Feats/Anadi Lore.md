# Anadi Lore
## Feat 1
### [[anadi]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You've learned how to provide for your community, be it through hard-earned sustenance or useful crafts. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Crafting and Survival. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in Anadi Lore.

_Note: If you are already trained in the skill provided by this feat, you need to manually select an alternative skill. You also need to manually enter the granted Lore skill._
