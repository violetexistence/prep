# Ring Their Bell `pf2:1`
## Feat 6
### [[flourish]][[guardian]][[incapacitation]]

**Category** class; 




**Requirements** You are wearing medium or heavy armor, and your taunted enemy is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] because it didn't target you or include you in an area effect.

* * *

Using your armor, you pummel a foe that isn't focused on you in the head or face to stagger them. Make a fist Strike against your taunted enemy even if you don't have a hand free; if you're wielding a [[Equipment/Gauntlet|Gauntlet]] or [[Equipment/Spiked Gauntlet|Spiked Gauntlet]], you can make a Strike with one of those weapons instead. If the Strike hits and deals damage, the creature must attempt a `Fortitude check` save against your class DC; this is an incapacitation effect.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature is [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]].

**Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 2]].

**Critical Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 3]].
