# Glitter Crystals
## Feat 8
### [[additive]][[alchemist]][[healing]]

**Category** class; 




You can mix a blend of crushed flowers and alchemical salt into an alchemical elixir with the healing trait or alchemical food. Choose one of the following effects: reduce the drained condition by 1, reduce the stupefied condition by 1, remove the [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] condition, or remove the [[Conditions/Deafened|Deafened]] condition. The creature who consumes the modified healing elixir or alchemical food gains this benefit in addition to the food or elixir's normal effects. This has no effect against permanent conditions.
