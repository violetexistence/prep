## Feat 8
### [[archetype]][[vigilante]]

**Prerequisites** Vigilante Dedication; Member of the Grey Gardeners; Harsh Judgement

You strike cleanly with wide, sweeping attacks to inflict maximum damage, taking advantage of your judged foe's fear to land a felling blow. If you Strike a creature you condemned with Harsh Judgment that has the frightened condition with a sweep melee weapon or a sweep unarmed attack, you gain a circumstance bonus to the Strike's damage equal to the number of weapon damage dice your weapon deals.
