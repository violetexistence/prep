# Glorious Banner
## Feat 20
### [[commander]]

**Category** class; 




Your banner is an awesome sight to behold. Your commander's banner now affects a 60-foot emanation (or an 80-foot burst if you are using Plant Banner); the status bonus to Will saves and DCs against fear effects granted to your allies increases to +2; and you and affected allies gain a +1 status bonus to AC, Fortitude saves, and Reflex saves. Enemies within the aura of your commander's banner take a â€“2 status penalty to Will saves as long as they can see your banner.
