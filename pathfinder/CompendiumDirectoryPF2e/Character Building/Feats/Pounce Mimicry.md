## Feat 14
### [[archetype]][[flourish]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Wild Mimic Dedication; you have seen a creature use an ability that lets them Stride and Strike as a single action (such as Pounce) or have identified a creature with such an ability in combat
* * *
**Requirements** You're unarmored or wearing light armor.

* * *

You have mastered the art of stalking your prey and striking when they are most vulnerable. You Stride and then Strike. If you began this action [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]], you remain hidden until after the Strike. You can use Pounce Mimicry while Burrowing, Climbing, Flying, or Swimming instead of Striding if you have the corresponding movement type.
