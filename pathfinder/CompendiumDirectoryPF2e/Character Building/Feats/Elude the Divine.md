# Elude the Divine
## Feat 8
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Bright Lion Dedication
* * *
You are able to escape inquisitions involving divine magic, allowing you to blend in well in Mzali but also to avoid unwanted attention in other oppressive theocracies. You gain the [[Feats/Slippery Secrets|Slippery Secrets]] skill feat, and its benefits also apply against divination effects that attempt to discern your deity. When using Slippery Secrets against a divine divination, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus, and on a critical success, the divination reveals false information appropriate to your false persona, rather than nothing.
