## Feat 14
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Lesson of the Circling Gale
* * *
You and your student enact a graceful dance of battle. When you use Lesson of the Circling Gale, you can Strike as a free action after you Step. Your multiple attack penalty applies to this Strike as normal. Your student can Strike after they Step as part of their reaction. This Strike doesn't count toward your student's multiple attack penalty, and their multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike.
