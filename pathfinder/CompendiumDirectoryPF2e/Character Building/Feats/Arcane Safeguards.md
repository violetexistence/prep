# Arcane Safeguards
## Feat 5
### [[automaton]]

**Category** ancestry; 




The magic powering you makes it difficult for outside magic to affect you. You gain the [[Actions/Resist Magic|Resist Magic]] reaction.

**Enhancement** Your safeguards improve. When you Resist Magic, you gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to the spell rank of the triggering effect.
