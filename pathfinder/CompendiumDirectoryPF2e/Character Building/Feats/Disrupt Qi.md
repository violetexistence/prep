# Disrupt Qi `pf2:2`
## Feat 12
### [[monk]][[void]]

**Category** class; 




You carefully target a creature's pressure points to block its inner life force. Make an unarmed Strike. If it deals damage to a living creature, that creature takes 0d6 persistent void damage and is [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]] until the persistent damage ends. If you're 18th level or higher, the persistent void damage increases to 3d6.
