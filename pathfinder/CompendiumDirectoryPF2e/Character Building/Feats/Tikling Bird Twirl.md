# Tikling Bird Twirl `pf2:r`
## Feat 5
### [[sarangay]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Trigger** You roll a critical hit on a melee Strike against an enemy.

* * *

You trained your footwork by dancing to music between snapping bamboo poles, and your increased mobility helps you succeed when hunting dangerous beasts or fighting multiple opponents. This style of bobbing and weaving and alternating fight and flight disorients your enemies and allows you to choose your engagements. After resolving your attack, you can immediately Step, Stride, or Swim.
