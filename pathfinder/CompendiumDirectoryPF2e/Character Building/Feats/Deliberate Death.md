# Deliberate Death `pf2:r`
## Feat 1
### [[duskwalker]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** You are about to gain the dying condition as a result of another creature's attack or ability, and that creature is within your melee reach.

Once, you died because someone—murderer, monster, or soldier—chose to strike you down. Just before losing consciousness, make a melee Strike against the triggering creature.

* * *

**Special** You can select this feat only at 1st level, and you can't retrain into or out of this feat.
