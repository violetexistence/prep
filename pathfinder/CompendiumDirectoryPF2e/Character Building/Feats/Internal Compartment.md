# Internal Compartment
## Feat 1
### [[android]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You can hide a small object of up to light Bulk inside a hollow cavity on one of your forearms. It takes three [[Actions/Interact|Interact]] actions to store an object in this way.

You gain a +4 circumstance bonus to the DCs of checks for others to [[Actions/Seek|Seek]] or [[Actions/Steal|Steal]] objects stored inside your arm.

If you store a weapon in your arm, you can use a single action to Interact to draw the weapon into the hand corresponding to your internal cavity, then Strike with the weapon.
