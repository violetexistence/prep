# Exigent Aura
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Battle Harbinger Dedication
* * *
The power of your deity and your own convictions leave an impression on creatures even when they normally would be unable to comprehend your words or the feelings spurred on by your god. Your battle auras can affect mindless creatures, though they gain a +4 circumstance bonus on saving throws to resist the battle aura's effects.
