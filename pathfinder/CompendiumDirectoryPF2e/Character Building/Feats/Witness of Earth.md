# Witness of Earth
## Feat 9
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[primal]][[yaksha]]

**Category** ancestry; 




The primal magic in your soul offers the patient earth's timeless counsel. You learn the [[Spells/Atone|Atone]] ritual. When you use the _atone_ ritual on yakshas and you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead, and if you roll a success, you get a critical success instead.
