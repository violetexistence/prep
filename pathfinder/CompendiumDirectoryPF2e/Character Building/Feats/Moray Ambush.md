# Moray Ambush `pf2:r`
## Feat 17
### [[athamaru]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Trigger** You are [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] and a creature who hasn't detected you passes within 20 feet of you.

* * *

Like the moray eels athamaru communities raise and train, you know how to quickly strike from hiding. Stride or Swim directly toward the triggering creature and make a melee Strike against it. The target creature is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] to this attack.

* * *

**Special** If you're mounted on an eel, you can have the eel move instead of yourself.
