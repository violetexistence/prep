# Free from Bonds
## Feat 16
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Flash of Omnipresence
* * *
As a mortal herald, you cannot easily be captured, nor can your allies. If you are [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]] when you use [[Feats/Flash of Omnipresence|Flash of Omnipresence]], the creature or effect that is imparting that condition on you takes spirit damage equal to your level.

If you teleport adjacent to a grabbed or restrained ally using Flash of Omnipresence, attempt a `Religion check` check against the hard DC for the level of the creature or effect that is imparting that condition. on a success, your ally no longer has that condition.
