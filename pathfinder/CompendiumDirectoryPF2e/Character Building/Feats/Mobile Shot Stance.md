# Mobile Shot Stance `pf2:1`
## Feat 8
### [[fighter]][[stance]]

**Category** class; 




Your shots become nimble and deadly. While you're in this stance, your ranged Strikes don't trigger Reactive Strike or other reactions that are triggered by a ranged attack.

* * *

**Special** If you have [[Actions/Reactive Strike|Reactive Strike]], you can use it with a loaded ranged weapon you're wielding. The triggering creature must be within 5 feet of you for you to do so.
