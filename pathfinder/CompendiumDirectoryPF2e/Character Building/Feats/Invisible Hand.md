# Invisible Hand
## Feat 16
### [[archetype]][[mythic]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Mortal Herald Dedication; master in Stealth
* * *
Sometimes your deity requires you to act in the shadows, accomplishing things without drawing attention to yourselfâ€”or them.

Once per day, when you roll Stealth for initiative at the start of a combat, you can choose to be [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]] for 1 minute. If you spend a Mythic Point while beginning the [[Actions/Avoid Notice|Avoid Notice]] exploration activity, you are invisible for as long as you continue to Avoid Notice.
