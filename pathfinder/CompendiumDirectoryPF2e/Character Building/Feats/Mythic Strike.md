# Mythic Strike
## Feat 10
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[mythic]]

**Category** class; 




You infuse your weapon or unarmed attack with mythic power before lashing out at an enemy with devastating force. Spend a Mythic Point and then Strike a creature with a weapon you're wielding or an unarmed attack you have available. This Strike is made at mythic proficiency, and the weapon or unarmed attack counts as a mythic weapon for the purposes of overcoming mythic resistance or mythic immunity.
