# Ghostly Condemnation `pf2:2`
## Feat 12
### [[archetype]][[divine]][[emotion]][[fear]][[mental]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Headless Haunt
* * *
You shriek a death sentence upon a single target within 120 feet, forcing it to experience the final moments of your mortal life as you were dragged through a howling mob and forced to kneel before the final blade that took your life and head. The target is subject to the effects of a 5th-rank [[Spells/Vision of Death|Vision of Death]] with a DC equal to your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. If you slay a significant foe with this ability, its physical body is gruesomely decapitated, forcing its allies within 15 feet to attempt a Will save against the same DC or be [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]] ([[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] on a critical failure).
