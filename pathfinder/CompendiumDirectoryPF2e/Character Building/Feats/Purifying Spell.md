# Purifying Spell `pf2:1`
## Feat 12
### [[concentrate]][[druid]][[spellshape]][[water]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** wave order
* * *
You purify the water within a creature's body to cleanse them of illness. If the next action you use is to cast [[Spells/Heal|Heal]] targeting a single living creature, you can attempt to counteract a disease or poison affecting the target, in addition to the other benefits of _heal_. If you do, _heal_ gains the water trait.
