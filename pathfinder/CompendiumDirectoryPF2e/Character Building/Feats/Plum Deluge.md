# Plum Deluge `pf2:3`
## Feat 20
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[alchemist]]

**Category** class; 




**Requirements** You have at least three of the same contact poison.

* * *

You have learned to saturate an area with poison in imitation of the techniques of your rival, Blue Viper. As part of this ability, you Interact to draw three vials of the same contact poison and throw them in the air, where they shatter and spread a poisonous deluge affecting a 20-foot burst within 60 feet. All creatures in the burst are automatically exposed to the poison, immediately bypassing any onset time, and must attempt a saving throw against that poison. The three vials must be identical, even if the poison can come in multiple types or different levels.
