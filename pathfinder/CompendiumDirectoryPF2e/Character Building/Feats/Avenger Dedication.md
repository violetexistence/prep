Your training regimen has given you particular advantages when it comes to enforcing the interests of your faith. You gain a +1 status bonus to saving throws against divine spells and effects that deal spirit damage. You can use Religion to [[Actions/coerce statistic=religion|coerce statistic=religion]]{Coerce}, [[Actions/gather-information statistic=religion|gather-information statistic=religion]]{Gather Information}, or [[Actions/track statistic=religion|track statistic=religion]]{Track} as long as you are in a town or city with a church dedicated to your deity, extracting clues from the faithful with displays of your piety.
