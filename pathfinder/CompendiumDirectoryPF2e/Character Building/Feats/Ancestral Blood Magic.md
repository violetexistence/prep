# Ancestral Blood Magic
## Feat 1
### [[sorcerer]]

**Category** class; 




The magic of your bloodline mixes with that of your ancestry. You gain your blood magic effect when you cast a non-cantrip spell you gained from a heritage or an ancestry feat, in addition to the normal circumstances that trigger your blood magic.
