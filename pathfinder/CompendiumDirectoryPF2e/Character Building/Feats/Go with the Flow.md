# Go with the Flow `pf2:r`
## Feat 7
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[general]][[secret]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** master in Occultism
* * *
**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** A creature detects your attempt to [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]], and you're within 30 feet of at least one other creature.

* * *

You have an occult connection to the world that helps you blend in with the cacophony of life around you. Attempt an `Occultism check` check against the creature's Perception DC. On a success, the creature mistakenly identifies another creature within 30 feet of you as you instead.
