# Remediate `pf2:0`
## Feat 16
### [[cleric]][[concentrate]][[spellshape]]

**Category** class; 




**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

If your next action is to use your divine font to cast a 3-action [[Spells/Heal|Heal]] or [[Spells/Harm|Harm]] spell, you can harness the residual energy to counterbalance opposing forces. In addition to its normal effects, you use your _heal_ or _harm_ spell to attempt to counteract one divine effect in the spell's area.
