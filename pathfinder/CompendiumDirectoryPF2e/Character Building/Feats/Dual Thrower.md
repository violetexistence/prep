# Dual Thrower
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Dual-Weapon Warrior Dedication
* * *
You know how to throw two weapons as easily as strike with them. Whenever a feat you gained from the dual-weapon warrior archetype allows you to make a melee Strike, you can instead make a ranged Strike with a thrown weapon or a one-handed ranged weapon you are wielding (weapons that need "1+" hand, such as longbows, don't qualify).

Any effects from these feats that apply to one-handed melee weapons or melee Strikes also apply to one-handed ranged weapons and ranged Strikes.
