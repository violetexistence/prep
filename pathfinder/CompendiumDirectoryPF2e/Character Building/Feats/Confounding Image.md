# Confounding Image
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Spell Trickster Dedication; ability to cast mirror image
* * *
When you cast [[Spells/Mirror Image|Mirror Image]], you can modify its duration to be sustained up to 1 minute and modify its range to 30 feet. If you do, replace the spell's standard effects with the following: You create an illusory duplicate of yourself that appears in an unoccupied square within range. The image takes up space and has a reach of 5 feet, and your allies can flank with the image. It doesn't have any other attributes a creature would normally have other than an AC equal to your spell DC and saving throw modifiers equal to your spell DC - 10. If the image is hit by an attack or fails a save, or if you ever move more than 30 feet from it, the spell ends. Creatures can move through its space without hindrance. When you Sustain the Spell, you can move the image to an unoccupied square within range.
