# Energy Fortification
## Feat 2
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[skill]][[general]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** Prepare Elemental Medicine; expert in Occultism
* * *
**Access** Minkai or Forest of Spirits origin

* * *

You learn Minkaian traditions about the void and know how to manipulate the five elements to fortify vitality and void energies in the body. When you [[Feats/Prepare Elemental Medicine|Prepare Elemental Medicine]], you can choose to use `Occultism check` instead of the usual skills. If you do, the medicine also grants the recipient resistance 2 and weakness 2 based on the element you chose. A wood, earth, or water elemental medicine grants resistance to void damage and weakness to vitality damage, and a living recipient loses its immunity to vitality damage for the duration. A fire or metal elemental medicine grants resistance to vitality damage and weakness to void damage, and an undead recipient loses its immunity to void damage for the duration.

If you're a master in Occultism, increase the resistance and weakness to 4. If you're legendary, instead increase them to 8.
