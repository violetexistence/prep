# Channel Smite `pf2:2`
## Feat 4
### [[cleric]][[divine]]

**Category** class; 




**Cost** Expend a [[Spells/Harm|Harm]] or [[Spells/Heal|Heal]] spell.

* * *

You siphon the energies of life and death through a melee attack and into your foe. Make a melee Strike. On a hit, you cast the 1-action version of the expended spell to damage the target, in addition to the normal damage from your Strike. The target automatically gets a failure on its save (or a critical failure if your Strike was a critical hit). The spell doesn't have the manipulate trait when cast this way.

The spell is expended with no effect if your Strike fails or hits a creature that isn't damaged by that energy type (such as if you hit a non-undead creature with a _heal_ spell).
