If you reduce the setup time for a batch of consumables at least 6 levels lower than you to less than 1 day, you can set it up in just 2 hours (allowing you to do so during an adventuring day if you have access to your tools and materials). If you rush the setup of a permanent item at least 6 levels lower than you and reduce the setup time to less than 1 day, you can perform the setup in 4 hours.
