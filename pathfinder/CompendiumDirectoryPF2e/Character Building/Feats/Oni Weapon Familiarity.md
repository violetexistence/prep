# Oni Weapon Familiarity
## Feat 1
### [[hungerseed]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Oni prefer large, cruel weapons for smashing their foes to pieces, and so do you. For the purposes of proficiency, you treat the [[Equipment/Khakkhara|Khakkhara]], [[Equipment/Nodachi|Nodachi]], [[Equipment/Ogre Hook|Ogre Hook]], and [[Equipment/Tetsubo|Tetsubo]] as simple weapons.

The ogre hook is an uncommon martial weapon that costs 1 gp, deals 1d10 piercing damage, has 2 Bulk, requires two hands to use, is in the pick weapon group, and has the deadly d10 and trip weapon traits.

At 5th level, whenever you get a critical hit with one of these weapons, or with your horns unarmed Strike, you get its critical specialization effect.
