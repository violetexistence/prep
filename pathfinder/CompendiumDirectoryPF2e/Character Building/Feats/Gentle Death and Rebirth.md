# Gentle Death and Rebirth
## Feat 17
### [[occult]][[yaoguai]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You were once born from the energies of the land and nature, and by their power, you can return to life again. Once per year, when you die, your remains become protected as if under the effects of a 5th-rank [[Spells/Peaceful Rest|Peaceful Rest]] spell. If your remains are brought and buried within 1 mile of where you were born, after a week, you return to life with the effects of a successful (but not critically successful) 9th-rank [[Spells/Resurrect|Resurrect]] ritual.
