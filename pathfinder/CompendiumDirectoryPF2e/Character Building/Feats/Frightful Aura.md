You're surrounded by a palpable sense of menace and power that's terrifying to behold. The aura is a 15-foot emanation. An enemy that enters or ends its turn in the aura must attempt a `Will check` save against the higher of your spell DC or class DC.

**Success** The creature is unaffected and temporarily immune to your Frightful Aura for 1 minute.

**Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]].

**Critical Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]].
