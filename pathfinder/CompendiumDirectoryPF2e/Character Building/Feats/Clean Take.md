# Clean Take `pf2:r`
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]][[fortune]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Kitharodian Actor Dedication
* * *
**Trigger** You fail, but don't critically fail, a Deception or Performance check to portray a famous figure.

* * *

Thanks to many long hours of rehearsals, your acting skill is infinitely adaptable. Even when your impressions don't quite hit the mark, you're able to refine and tweak your performance on the spot. Reroll the triggering check and take the second result.
