# Devastating Duelist `pf2:1`
## Feat 18
### [[archetype]][[flourish]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Aldori Duelist Dedication
* * *
You pointedly note your enemy's deficiencies, filling them with fear and dismay. Strike an opponent with your [[Equipment/Aldori Dueling Sword|Aldori Dueling Sword]].

If the Strike is successful, attempt a Dueling Lore check against the target's Will DC. On a success, the target becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]]. This is an emotion, fear, and mental effect.
