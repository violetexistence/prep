# Repeating Hand Crossbow Training
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Crossbow Infiltrator Dedication
* * *
The specific needs of your organization or mission warrant your use of the latest in ingenious crossbow technology. You gain access to repeating hand crossbows and repeater bandoliers.

If you have [[Feats/Running Reload|Running Reload]] or a similar feat that allows you to reload and perform another action or activity as a single action, you can use that action more efficiently with a repeating weapon. You can use the action as a 3-action activity to reload a magazine into a repeating weapon after you perform its other granted action, or as a 2-action activity if you use a magazine from a repeater bandolier.
