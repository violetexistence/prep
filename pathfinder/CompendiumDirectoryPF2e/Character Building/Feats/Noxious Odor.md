**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Emit Defensive Odor

You have developed your skill with your defensive pheromones and have concentrated them into a noxious form. A creature that fails its save against your Emit Defensive Odor action also becomes [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] (or [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]] on a critical failure).
