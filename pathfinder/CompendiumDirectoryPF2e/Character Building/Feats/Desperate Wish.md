# Desperate Wish
## Feat 12
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Starlit Sentinel Dedication
* * *
You call out a desperate wish to the stars to save a friend. You gain [[Spells/Breath of Life|Breath of Life]] as an innate arcane spell, which you can cast once per day only while in sentinel form. Interceding in such a direct way temporarily exhausts your constellation's magic, causing you to revert from your sentinel form once the spell is cast.
