# Deific Font `pf2:1`
## Feat 18
### [[archetype]][[divine]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Mortal Herald Dedication
* * *
**Frequency** once per hour

Your life force can fuel the stuff of miracles. You become [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]] or increase the value of your drained condition by 1 if you already have the drained condition. Before the end of your next turn, if you Cast a Spell of 4th rank or lower, you don't expend the spell's slot when you cast it, or if you cast a focus spell, it does not cost a Focus Point. The spell loses whatever tradition trait it would normally have and gains the divine trait.
