### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Knight Reclaimant Dedication
* * *
You gain the [[Spells/Shall not Falter, Shall not Rout|Shall not Falter, Shall not Rout]] focus spell. If you don't already have one, you gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point, which you can regain using the Refocus activity to recite the Crimson Oath and meditate on its teachings. If you already have a focus pool, increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1. Your knight reclaimant focus spells are divine spells; when you gain this feat, you become trained in divine spell attacks and spell DCs and your spellcasting ability is Charisma.
