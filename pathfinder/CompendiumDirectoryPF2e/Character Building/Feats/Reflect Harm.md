# Reflect Harm
## Feat 14
### [[sorcerer]]

**Category** class; 




You can wrap your magic around you like a cloak that causes those who dare to target you with spells to suffer a similar fate. You know the following blood magic effect.

**Blood Magicâ€”Reflect Harm** Your blood ensures that those who harm you with magic are harmed in return. The first time you take damage from a spell before the beginning of your next turn, attempt spell attack roll against the creature who cast the triggering spell. On a hit, the creature takes the same amount and type of damage that you just took. If you critically hit, the creature takes twice the damage.
