# Everyone's a Suspect
## Feat 20
### [[investigator]]

**Category** class; 




You are so suspicious of everyone you meet that you keep mental notes on how to defeat them all-even your own allies.

After interacting with a creature for at least 1 minute, you automatically [[Actions/Pursue a Lead|Pursue a Lead]] with that creature as the subject. You can have any number of such leads at any given time, and when you Pursue a Lead again, you don't give up any of these automatic subjects.
