# Rites of Liberation
## Feat 14
### [[mythic]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Broken Chain Dedication
* * *
You learn the [[Spells/Freedom|Freedom]] ritual. If you spend an additional Mythic Point while casting it, you reduce its casting time to 1 hour, and both the primary and secondary casters attempt their corresponding skill checks at mythic proficiency. If you would critically fail the ritual, you fail instead. Additionally, you gain the [[Spells/Unimpeded Stride|Unimpeded Stride]] and [[Spells/Word of Freedom|Word of Freedom]] domain spells. These are focus spells, granting you a focus pool of 2 Focus Points or expanding that pool if you already have one. You can Refocus while you meditate on the concepts of freedom and liberty.
