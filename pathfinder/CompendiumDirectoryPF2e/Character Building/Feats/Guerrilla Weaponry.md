You are especially skilled in transforming simple weapons that can be easily assembled from readily available materials into deadly weapons. In your hands, a blowgun's base damage increases from 1 to a 1d4 damage die, and it gains the deadly d4 trait. In addition, you gain the [[Actions/Guerrilla Assault|Guerrilla Assault]] action.
