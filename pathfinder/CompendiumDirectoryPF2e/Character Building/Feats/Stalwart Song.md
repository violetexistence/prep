# Stalwart Song `pf2:r`
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Stalwart Defender Dedication
* * *
**Trigger** You're about to attempt a saving throw against a fear effect.

**Requirements** You're in [[Actions/Tenacious Stance|Tenacious Stance]].

* * *

As a stalwart defender, you rely on your martial training and your tried-and-true armor to face any danger without flinching. Your mountain-like resilience and courage draw strength from the centuries-old traditions of dwarven song. You bring to mind—and possibly give voice to—a cherished dwarven song of inspiring heroism, granting you a +2 circumstance bonus to the saving throw.
