# Targeting Strike
## Feat 10
### [[commander]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Guiding Shot or Set-Up Strike
* * *
Your attack creates an opening in your target's defenses for your allies to capitalize on. When you successfully damage an opponent with either Guiding Shot or Set-Up Strike, the next creature other than you to attack the same target before the start of your next turn deals an amount of additional precision damage equal to your Intelligence modifier.
