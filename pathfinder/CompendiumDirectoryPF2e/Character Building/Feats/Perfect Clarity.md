# Perfect Clarity `pf2:r`
## Feat 18
### [[barbarian]][[concentrate]][[fortune]][[rage]]

**Category** class; 




**Trigger** You fail or critically fail an attack roll or Will save.

* * *

You burn out all your rage to ensure that your attack lands and your mind remains free. Reroll the triggering attack roll or Will save with a +2 circumstance bonus, and use the better result. You then immediately stop raging.
