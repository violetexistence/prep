# Inspire Imitation
## Feat 5
### [[aiuvarin]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Your actions inspire your allies to great achievements. Whenever you critically succeed at a skill check, you automatically qualify to use the [[Actions/Aid|Aid]] reaction when attempting to help an ally using the same skill, even without spending an action to prepare to do so.
