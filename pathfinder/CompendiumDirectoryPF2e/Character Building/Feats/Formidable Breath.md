# Formidable Breath
## Feat 9
### [[dragonblood]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Breath of the Dragon
* * *
Thanks to rigorous breathing exercises and a diet similar to that of your lineage, your magical breath is more powerful. The area of your Breath of the Dragon increases to 30 feet for a cone or 60 feet for a line, and the damage dice are d6s instead of d4s.
