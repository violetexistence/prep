## Feat 16
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Artillerist Dedication
* * *
What you don't know about artillery isn't worth knowing and your mastery allows you to perform an impossible number of actions as part of a siege weapon's crew. You're permanently [[Conditions/Quickened|Quickened]]. You can only use the extra action to Aim or Launch a siege weapon.
