# Worm's Feast `pf2:2`
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]][[primal]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Worm Caller Dedication
* * *
**Frequency** once per day

* * *

You call forth a brood of infantile cave worms to feast on your enemy's flesh. Choose a creature within 30 feet; the creature must attempt a `Fortitude check` save. At 8th level and every 2 levels above that, the persistent piercing damage taken on a failure increases by 1d6.

* * *

**Critical Success** The worms writhe away harmlessly.

**Success** The target takes 2d6 piercing + 2d6 persistent piercing damage.

**Failure** The target takes 6d6 piercing + 2d6 persistent piercing damage.

**Critical Failure** As failure, plus the target is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] as long as it takes persistent piercing damage.
