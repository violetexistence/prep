# Leshy Superstition `pf2:r`
## Feat 1
### [[leshy]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Trigger** You attempt a saving throw against a spell or magical effect, but haven't rolled yet.

* * *

You notice spirits that inhabit objects, learning which bring good fortune and which are unlucky. You focus on the power of a lucky object, granting you a +1 circumstance bonus to your saving throw against the triggering effect.
