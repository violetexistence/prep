# Minor Magic
## Feat 2
### [[rogue]]

**Category** class; 




You've dabbled in minor magical abilities. Choose arcane, divine, occult, or primal magic, and gain two cantrips from the common cantrips that are available in that tradition. You gain the [[Actions/Cast a Spell|Cast a Spell]] activity, your key spellcasting ability is Charisma, and you're trained in spell attack rolls and DCs for the tradition you chose.
