**Prerequisites** Wylderheart Dedication
* * *
You gain a young animal companion that has been specially trained to help you fight demons. You can choose any common animal companion, which gains scent as an imprecise sense with a range of 30 feet that can be used only to smell fiends. If the animal companion already has scent, it gains a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception when using scent against fiends.
