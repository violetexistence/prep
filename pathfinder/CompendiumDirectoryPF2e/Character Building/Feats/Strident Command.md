# Strident Command
## Feat 10
### [[archetype]][[vigilante]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Vigilante Dedication; Member of the Grey Gardeners; master in Intimidation; Voice of Authority
* * *
The common folk heed your demands, and though your true foes rarely bend to your commands, when they do the hesitation can cost them the battle. You can cast [[Spells/Command|Command]] once every 10 minutes as a 1st-rank occult innate spell.

If you're in your vigilante identity, you can command the target only to approach you, drop prone, or stand in place. If you're in your social identity, you can command the target only to run away or release what the target is holding.
