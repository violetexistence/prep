# Grudging Compliment `pf2:r`
## Feat 7
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[archetype]][[linguistic]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** Celebrity Dedication
* * *
**Trigger** An enemy within 30 feet damages you or succeeds at a skill check.

* * *

Every Firebrand can recognize the skill of others, but you've turned it into an art you can wield in combat. You compliment a foe's form or technique, and your unexpected praise distracts them from their surroundings. Attempt a `Diplomacy check` check against that enemy's Will DC. Regardless of your result, they are temporarily immune to your Grudging Compliments for 10 minutes.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target becomes [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] for 1 round.

**Success** The target becomes off-guard against your attacks for 1 round.
