# Familiar
## Feat 1
### [[magus]][[sorcerer]][[thaumaturge]][[wizard]]

**Category** class; 




**Magus, Sorcerer** An animal serves you and assists your spellcasting.

**Wizard** You make a pact with a creature that serves you and assists your spellcasting.

**Thaumaturge** Whether by following occult rituals, piecing together scraps of arcane theory, or some other method, you've called forth a creature that now serves as your constant companion in your studies of the supernatural.

You gain a familiar.
