# Occult Dragonblood
## Feat 1
### [[dragonblood]][[lineage]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Your blood contains a tiny fragment of unusual or inexplicable power from a mysterious dragon, such as a conspirator dragon or omen dragon. You are drawn to the stranger parts of the world and can generally spot them with a glance. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Occultism. If you would automatically become trained in Occultism (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You gain the [[Feats/Oddity Identification|Oddity Identification]] skill feat. If you choose a draconic exemplar, you must choose an occult dragon.
