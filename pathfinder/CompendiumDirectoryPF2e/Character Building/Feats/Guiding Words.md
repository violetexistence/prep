Your words speak divine truth, guiding blades and arrows to their mark. Choose an ally within 30 feet and attempt a `Diplomacy check` check. The DC is equal to the hard difficulty DC of the level of your ally. On a success, the first time the targeted ally makes an attack roll before the end of their next turn, they roll the attack twice and use the better result.

Regardless of the result, the target becomes immune to Guiding Words for 10 minutes.
