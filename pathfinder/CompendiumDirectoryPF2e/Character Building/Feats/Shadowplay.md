# Shadowplay `pf2:1`
## Feat 5
### [[illusion]][[occult]][[shadow]][[wayang]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Requirements** Your last action was a melee Strike that damaged your opponent.

* * *

As your blow lands, you detach from your shadow to get the drop on your enemy. You attempt to [[Actions/tumble-through options=shadowplay|tumble-through options=shadowplay]] the opponent's space, with a +2 circumstance bonus to the Acrobatics check. If you succeed, your shadow rises up from the ground, flanking your opponent until the beginning of your next turn.
