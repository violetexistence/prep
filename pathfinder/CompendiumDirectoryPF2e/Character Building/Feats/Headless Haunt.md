# Headless Haunt
## Feat 4
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Ghost Dedication
* * *
**Access** You were executed with a [[Equipment/Final Blade|Final Blade]].

* * *

You were condemned to death and executed with one of Galt's infamous _final blades_, where your soul was trapped for years or even decades. You might have been released alongside a host of other spirits when your prison was destroyed after the Night of the Gray Death, or powerful magic or other unique circumstances might have facilitated your escape. Whatever the method, you have unfinished business preventing you from passing on to the afterlife. You gain the [[Actions/Remove Head|Remove Head]] action.
