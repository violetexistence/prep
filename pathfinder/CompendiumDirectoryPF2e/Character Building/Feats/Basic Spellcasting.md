# Basic Spellcasting
## Feat 4
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[pervasive-magic]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Cantrip Casting
* * *
You increase your ability to cast spells. You gain the [[PF2e Journals/Archetypes/Basic Spellcasting Feat|Basic Spellcasting Feat]] benefits granted by spellcasting archetypes, gaining a spell repertoire. Each time you gain a spell slot of a new level from the basic, expert, and master spellcasting benefits from pervasive magic feats, add a spell of the appropriate spell rank to your repertoire: a common spell of the magical tradition matching your trait, or another spell of that tradition that you have learned or discovered.
