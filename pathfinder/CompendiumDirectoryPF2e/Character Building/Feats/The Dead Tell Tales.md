# The Dead Tell Tales
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]][[divine]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Campfire Chronicler Dedication
* * *
New campfire chroniclers are inundated with the stories of the ghosts below Pulura's Fall and the lessons learned there. You have resistance equal to your level to spirit and void damage caused by a haunt, spirit, or incorporeal undead. The first time you take damage from a haunt or spirit, you learn the general story of its origin (such as the type of tragedy that caused a ghost to linger or what a spirit represents).
