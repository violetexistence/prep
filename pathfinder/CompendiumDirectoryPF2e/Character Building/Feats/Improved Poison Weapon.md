# Improved Poison Weapon
## Feat 8
### [[rogue]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Poison Weapon
* * *
You deliver poisons in ways that maximize their harmful effects. When you apply a simple poison with [[Feats/Poison Weapon|Poison Weapon]], the poison deals 2d4 poison damage instead of 1d4 poison damage. You don't waste a poison you apply with Poison Weapon on a critically failed attack roll.
