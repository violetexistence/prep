# Elven Verve
## Feat 1
### [[elf]]

**Category** ancestry; 




While all elves are immune to the paralyzing touch of ghouls, you can shake off flesh-numbing magic of all kinds. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saves against effects that would impose the [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]], [[Conditions/Paralyzed|Paralyzed]], or [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed]] conditions. When you would be immobilized, paralyzed, or slowed for at least 2 rounds, reduce that duration by 1 round.
