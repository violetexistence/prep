# Shared Prey
## Feat 14
### [[ranger]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Double Prey; Warden's Boon
* * *
Hunting as a duo, you and your ally both single out your prey. When you use [[Actions/Hunt Prey|Hunt Prey]] and select only one prey, you can grant your Hunt Prey benefits and hunter's edge to an ally in addition to gaining them yourself. The ally retains these benefits until you use Hunt Prey again.
