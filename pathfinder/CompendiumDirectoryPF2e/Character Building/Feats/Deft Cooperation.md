When you set things up to help your allies, you also gain some of the fruits of your labors. When you successfully Aid an attack roll or AC, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to attack rolls or AC against that enemy until the end of your next turn, whichever you granted to your ally. When you successfully Aid a skill check, if you attempt the exact same skill check (not just using the same skill, but using it for the same purpose, for instance a check to Climb the same wall) on your next turn, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your skill check.
