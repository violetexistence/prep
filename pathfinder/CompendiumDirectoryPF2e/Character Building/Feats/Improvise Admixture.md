# Improvise Admixture `pf2:1`
## Feat 2
### [[alchemist]][[concentrate]][[manipulate]]

**Category** class; 




**Frequency** once per day

**Requirements** You have fewer than your maximum number of versatile vials, and you're either holding or wearing an alchemist's toolkit.

* * *

You scrounge together enough ingredients from what's left in your alchemist's toolkit to produce a few more versatile vials on the fly. Attempt a `Crafting check` check. The DC is usually a standard-difficulty DC for your level, but the GM can assign a different DC based on the circumstances. The number of vials you regain depends on the result of your check (up to your maximum).

* * *

**Critical Success** You regain 3 versatile vials.

**Success** You regain 2 versatile vials.

**Failure** You regain 1 versatile vial.

**Critical Failure** You don't regain any versatile vials.
