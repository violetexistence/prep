# Armored Regiment Training
## Feat 1
### [[commander]]

**Category** class; 




You've trained for grueling marches in full battle kit. You treat heavy armor as being 1 Bulk lighter than it actually is, and you can rest normally while wearing armor of any type. In exploration mode, you and your allies use your normal Speeds without including your armors' Speed penalties to determine your travel Speed.
