# Artery Map
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Lepidstadt Surgeon Dedication
* * *
While you've learned all the places a scalpel can cause extensive bleeding to avoid disasters in surgery, such knowledge can serve other purposes. When you Strike an [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] creature with a weapon from the knife group, you deal 1d6 persistent bleed damage. The damage increases to 1d10 when you are legendary in Medicine.
