# Reactive Strike `pf2:r`
## Feat 6
### [[barbarian]][[champion]][[exemplar]][[guardian]][[magus]][[swashbuckler]]

**Category** class; 




**Trigger** A creature within your reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.

* * *

You swat a foe that leaves an opening. Make a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If your attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, you disrupt that action. This Strike doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike.
