## Feat 6
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Vigilante Dedication; Member of the Grey Gardeners

You have a sense for when people are lying. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus on your secret Perception checks to [[Actions/Sense Motive|Sense Motive]].

If you use Sense Motive on a creature you have currently condemned with Harsh Judgment, your GM rolls the Perception check twice and takes the higher result (this is a fortune effect).
