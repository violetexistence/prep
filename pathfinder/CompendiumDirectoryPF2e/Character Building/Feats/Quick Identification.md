# Quick Identification
## Feat 1
### [[general]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion
* * *
You can Identify Magic swiftly. You take only 1 minute when using Identify Magic to determine the properties of an item, ongoing effect, or location, rather than 10 minutes. If you're a master, it takes a 3-action activity, and if you're legendary, it takes 1 action.
