### [[archetype]][[flourish]][[manipulate]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Crossbow Infiltrator Dedication

You can fire off a single shot even when it seems like you are unprepared. You Interact to reload your hand crossbow or gauntlet bow and attempt a ranged Strike with it.

* * *

**Special** If you have the Repeating Hand Crossbow Training feat, you can use this feat with a repeating hand crossbow to load an entire magazine, but the speed means you can fire only one bolt before the magazine jams and becomes useless. You must fully replace a magazine as normal before firing with a repeating hand crossbow after using this ability.
