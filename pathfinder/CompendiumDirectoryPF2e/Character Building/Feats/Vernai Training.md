# Vernai Training
## Feat 12
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Achaekek's Grip; Basic Red Mantis Magic
* * *
To resurrect a creature you've slain, a spellcaster must counteract your influence on its death. The DC of this check is equal to your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.

In addition, you've undergone training to better make use of your magic. Increase the spell slots you gain from Red Mantis assassin archetype feats by 1 for each spell rank other than your two highest Red Mantis spell slots. You can prepare only spells from the Red Mantis magic school curriculum in these extra slots.
