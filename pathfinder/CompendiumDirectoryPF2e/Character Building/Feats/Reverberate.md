You can manipulate the acoustics around you to deflect sonic damage back at its source. Attempt a Performance check against the Will DC of the creature or Fortitude DC of a hazard. If the damage came from a spell, use the creature's spell DC if it's lower.

**Critical Success** You reduce the triggering damage by an amount up to four times your level. The creature takes sonic damage equal to the amount of damage you reduced in this way.
