# Raise Haft
## Feat 2
### [[guardian]]

**Category** class; 




You know how to use the haft of larger weapons to block your enemies' attacks. Two-handed weapons you wield gain the parry trait. If the weapon already has the parry trait, you increase the circumstance bonus to AC it provides to +2.
