# Hunter's Aim `pf2:2`
## Feat 2
### [[concentrate]][[ranger]]

**Category** class; 




When you focus on aiming, your attack becomes particularly accurate. Make a ranged weapon Strike against your hunted prey. On this Strike, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the attack roll and ignore your prey's [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] condition and any lesser cover.
