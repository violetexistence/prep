# River Adaptation
## Feat 9
### [[lizardfolk]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** makari lizardfolk heritage
* * *
Webbing sprouts on your legs and tail as you shift to a more aquatic form. You can cast [[Spells/Feet to Fins|Feet to Fins]] as an innate divine spell once per day. This innate magic relies on your makari heritage, limiting the effect to yourself but allowing you to cast it more easily than a common mage; you can target only yourself with the spell, but you can Cast the Spell as a free action if you're within a body of water when you cast it.
