# Crescent Cross Training
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Crossbow Infiltrator Dedication
* * *
You have familiarity with the [[Equipment/Crescent Cross|Crescent Cross]], an ingenious weapon that combines an arm-mounted, multi-chamber crossbow with a crescent-shaped blade. For the purposes of proficiency, you treat both its configurations as simple weapons.

Feats and abilities from this archetype that normally work with a gauntlet bow also work with your crescent cross, treating the melee form of the crescent cross as a gauntlet where appropriate. You gain the [[Actions/Crescent Spray|Crescent Spray]] action.
