# Riddle The Sphinx
## Feat 6
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[exemplar]][[ikon]]

**Category** class; 




**Usage** imbued into a body ikon

* * *

You've learned the secrets of the sphinx's riddles and empowered your ikon with them. You can voice these mysteries, forcing others to overcome them as you did.

**Transcendenceâ€”[[Actions/Tangle in Riddle|Tangle in Riddle]]** `pf2:1` (auditory, mental, transcendence) You speak a bizarre koan that transcends language and is understood by only one creature within 30 feet. The target must attempt a `Will check` save against your class DC. It's then immune to this ability for 1 hour.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target is [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] for 1 round.

**Failure** The target is stupefied 1 for 1d4 rounds.

**Critical Failure** The target is stupefied 1 and [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]] for 1d4 rounds.
