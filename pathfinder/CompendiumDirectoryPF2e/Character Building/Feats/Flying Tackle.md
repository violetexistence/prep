# Flying Tackle `pf2:2`
## Feat 4
### [[flourish]][[guardian]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Athletics
* * *
You barrel forward, gathering enough momentum to take down a threatening foe. Stride and then [[Actions/Leap|Leap]], or attempt to [[Actions/High Jump|High Jump]] or [[Actions/Long Jump|Long Jump]]. If you end your movement adjacent to a foe, you can attempt to [[Actions/Trip|Trip]] that foe. If you succeed at the Athletics check to Trip, you get a critical success instead. You can use Flying Tackle while Burrowing, Climbing, Flying, or Swimming instead of Striding if you have the corresponding movement type.
