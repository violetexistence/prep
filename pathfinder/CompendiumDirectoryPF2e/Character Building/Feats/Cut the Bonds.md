# Cut the Bonds `pf2:1`
## Feat 12
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[archetype]][[attack]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Bellflower Dedication; expert in a melee weapon
* * *
Select a magical effect that has made an adjacent member of your crop clumsy, grabbed, paralyzed, restrained, or slowed. Attempt a counteract check using your attack modifier (including your multiple attack penalty) with a melee weapon with which you have expert proficiency. Your counteract rank is half your level rounded up. On a success, you free that member from the effect; on a failure, you can't attempt to use Cut the Bonds on that effect on that crop member until 24 hours have passed.
