# You Don't Smell Right
## Feat 8
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Werecreature Dedication
* * *
You can sniff out fellow werecreatures and master impersonators alike. You gain scent as an imprecise sense with a range of 30 feet or extend the range of your scent by 30 feet. When a creature that's transformed into another form or is [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonating]] a specific creature passes within range of your scent ability, the GM rolls a secret `Perception check` check for you to realize that the creature is transformed, even if you didn't spend an action to [[Actions/Seek|Seek]]. When you actively Seek a creature within range of your scent, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Perception check to determine if it's disguised.
