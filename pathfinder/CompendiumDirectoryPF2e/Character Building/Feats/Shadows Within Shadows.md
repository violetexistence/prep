# Shadows Within Shadows `pf2:r`
## Feat 12
### [[animist]][[apparition]][[divine]][[misfortune]][[wandering]]

**Category** class; 




**Trigger** You would be detected by an enemy Seeking you, or an enemy would succeed at a counteract check against a spell making you [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]], [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]], or [[Conditions/Undetected|Undetected]].

**Requirements** Your attuned apparition grants Hunting Lore or Underworld Lore as one of its apparition skills.

* * *

Your apparition possesses a furtive and elusive nature that can influence and blend with your spiritual energy to form a protective and nearly impenetrable shroud of nondetection around you. The enemy must reroll the triggering check and take the lower result.
