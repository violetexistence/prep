# Person of Interest `pf2:1`
## Feat 2
### [[investigator]]

**Category** class; 




**Frequency** once per 10 minutes

* * *

Sometimes, you need to follow the leads as they come in the middle of an investigation. Choose a creature that you can see who isn't, to your knowledge, tied to any of your current investigations. For the next minute, you can [[Actions/Devise a Stratagem|Devise a Stratagem]] against that creature as a free action.
