# Pack Movement `pf2:2`
## Feat 8
### [[archetype]][[flourish]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Beastmaster Dedication
* * *
You and your companion move to take down a common enemy. You and your animal companion both Stride. If both of you end your movement within reach of the same creature, you and your animal companion each make a melee Strike against the creature. You can use Pack Movement to Burrow, Climb, Fly, or Swim instead of Stride if both you and your animal companion have the corresponding movement type.
