# Blind-Fight
## Feat 8
### [[fighter]][[investigator]][[ranger]][[rogue]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** master in Perception
* * *
**Fighter, Rogue, Investigator** Your battle instincts make you more aware of [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] and [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]] opponents.

**Ranger** Your heightened senses allow you to instinctively detect unseen opponents.

* * *

You don't need to succeed at a flat check to target concealed creatures. You're not [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] to creatures that are [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] from you (unless you're off-guard to them for reasons other than the hidden condition), and you need only a successful `DC 5 Flat check` to target a hidden creature.

While you're adjacent to an [[Conditions/Undetected|Undetected]] creature of your level or lower, it is instead only hidden from you.
