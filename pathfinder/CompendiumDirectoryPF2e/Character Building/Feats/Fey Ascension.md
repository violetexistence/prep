# Fey Ascension
## Feat 9
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Fey Influence
* * *
The fey influence on your form and features grows even more powerful and notable. You gain one of the following features and abilities; this must be the same animal or fey type as you chose for Fey Influence.

*   **Anteater** You become an expert in primal DCs and spell attack rolls. You can cast [[Spells/Slow|Slow]] as an innate primal spell once per day.
*   **Cat Sith** You laugh off the outraged curses of those you have tricked or wronged. Whenever a creature targets you with a misfortune effect, make a `DC 13 Flat check`. On a success, you are unaffected.
*   **Cursed Bluebird** You have enough control over your curse to turn a bane into a minor blessing. Once per day, you can temporarily transform yourself or an ally into a blue bird, as a 4th-rank [[Spells/Pest Form|Pest Form]] (bird only) targeting one willing creature.
*   **Dryad** Your hair becomes intermixed with delicate but razor-edged leaves that move as you command. You gain a leaves ranged unarmed attack that deals 1d6 slashing damage. Your leaves are in the dart weapon group and have the magical and unarmed traits. _Note: A range was not provided for this strike in the source. For Foundry automation we have assumed a 20-foot range increment, to be in line with similar abilities._
*   **Faun** You can cast [[Spells/Charm|Charm]], [[Spells/Sleep|Sleep]], and [[Spells/Triple Time|Triple Time]] as innate primal spells once per day each. Whenever you cast one of these spells, you can Step or Stride as part of the activity.
*   **Gremlin** You become an expert in primal DCs and spell attack rolls. You can cast [[Spells/Mad Monkeys|Mad Monkeys]] as an innate primal spell once per day.
*   **Monarch** Once per day, you gain the ability to manifest a pair of exquisite butterfly wings. These wings remain for 10 minutes. You gain a fly Speed equal to your Speed while you've manifested your wings. [[Feat_Feature Effects/Effect_ Monarch Wings|Effect: Monarch Wings]]
*   **Unicorn** You become trained in Medicine, or an expert if you were already trained. You gain a +2 status bonus to saves against poison and charm effects.

* * *

**Special** This feat gains the trait appropriate for your ancestry (human for human, goblin for goblin, etc.).
