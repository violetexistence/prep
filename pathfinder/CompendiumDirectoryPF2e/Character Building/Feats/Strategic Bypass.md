# Strategic Bypass
## Feat 14
### [[investigator]]

**Category** class; 




Your plans account for your foes' resistances, enabling you to strike a telling blow. When you hit with a Strike on which you substituted your attack roll due to [[Actions/Devise a Stratagem|Devise a Strategem]], you ignore an amount of resistance equal to your Intelligence modifier for each resistance that applies against your attack.
