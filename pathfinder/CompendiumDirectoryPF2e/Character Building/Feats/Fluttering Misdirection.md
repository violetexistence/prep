You've trained in drawing the eyes of your audience to specific aspects of your performance through the careful manipulation of your fans and body. While wielding a fan, you can snap open, flutter, or otherwise manipulate the fan to briefly distract observers around you, giving you and adjacent allies a constant +1 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks to secretly [[Actions/Conceal an Object|Conceal an Object]] and to Thievery checks to [[Actions/Steal|Steal]] or [[Actions/Palm an Object|Palm an Object]].
