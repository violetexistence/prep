# Patron Reborn
## Feat 20
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Seneschal Witch Dedication
* * *
You have fully realized the ability to serve as a patron.

Your newfound abilities enhance your senses, rolling back the veil of a realm hidden to most mortals where great beings vie for unimaginable influence over vast worlds. You gain darkvision, constant [[Spells/Truesight|Truesight]], and the ability to see into all other transitive planes that overlap the one you are in.

You can be a patron for other witches. Choose a single type of patron you represent, such as [[Class Features/The Resentment|The Resentment]] or [[Class Features/Starless Shadow|Starless Shadow]]. An allied witch you can observe who has that patron counts as and gains the benefits of your [[Feats/Witch's Charge|Witch's Charge]] feat, even if you did not select them as your charge during your daily preparations.

You learn the [[Spells/Wish|Wish]] ritual and can impart that knowledge to your charges. Once per month, when one of your charges performs the _wish_ ritual, you can roll the skill check in their place.
