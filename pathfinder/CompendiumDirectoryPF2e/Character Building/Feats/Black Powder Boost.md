You fire your weapon as you jump, using the kickback to go farther. You [[Actions/Leap|Leap]] and discharge your firearm to add a +10-foot status bonus to the distance traveled. If you spend 2 actions for Black Powder Boost, you [[Actions/High Jump|High Jump]] or [[Actions/Long Jump|Long Jump]] instead.

**Special** An ability that allows you to High Jump or Long Jump as a single action (like the [[Feats/Quick Jump|Quick Jump]] skill feat) lets you use Black Powder Boost as a single action for those jumps as well.
