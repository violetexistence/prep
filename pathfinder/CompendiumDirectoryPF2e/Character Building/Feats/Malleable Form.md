# Malleable Form `pf2:1`
## Feat 13
### [[reflection]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** ability to cast at least one polymorph spell
* * *
**Requirements** You're polymorphed by a spell that has multiple choices of battle form.

* * *

You adroitly shift your form, taking on another appearance. Choose a different battle form of the polymorph spell affecting you, and change to that form instead of the current one. This destabilizes the spell's magic, reducing its duration by 1 round. Use the rank of the spell to determine the statistics, as normal.
