# Hobgoblin Lore
## Feat 1
### [[hobgoblin]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You've studied traditional hobgoblin exercises and fieldcraft, all of which have a militaristic bent. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Athletics and Crafting. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.

You gain the [[Feats/Additional Lore|Additional Lore]] general feat for Hobgoblin Lore.
