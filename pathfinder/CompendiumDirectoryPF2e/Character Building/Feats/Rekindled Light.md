# Rekindled Light `pf2:r`
## Feat 5
### [[healing]][[kitsune]][[vitality]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Star Orb
* * *
**Trigger** You or an ally within 30 feet of your [[Feats/Star Orb|Star Orb]] familiar would be reduced to 0 Hit Points but not immediately killed.

* * *

You temporarily drain your star orb familiar's energy to save an ally. The target avoids being knocked out and remains at 1 Hit Point, and their [[Conditions/Wounded|Wounded]] condition increases by 1. The target then regains Hit Points equal to your level. When the familiar's energy is drained, it becomes dormant until your next daily preparations.
