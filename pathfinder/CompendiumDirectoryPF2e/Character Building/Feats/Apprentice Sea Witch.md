# Apprentice Sea Witch
## Feat 5
### [[merfolk]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You're familiar with the basic spells that most educated merfolk know. Once per day, you can cast either [[Spells/Create Water|Create Water]] or [[Spells/Hydraulic Push|Hydraulic Push]] as a 1st-rank primal innate spell. Each time you cast _create water_, you choose if you create fresh water or salt water.
