# Fearsome Familiar `pf2:3`
## Feat 6
### [[impulse]][[kineticist]][[primal]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** a familiar
* * *
Your familiar trades places with an elemental from its elemental plane. Summon a common creature that has the elemental trait and a level no greater than your level - 4. This creature appears in the same space as your familiar, which disappears for the duration of this impulse. The elemental can appear in a space it can't normally reach. A creature you summon with the Fearsome Familiar feat gains the summoned trait. You can Sustain this impulse up to 1 minute. When the impulse ends, the familiar appears in the space the summoned elemental occupied. A familiar can endure this process only so often-if you use this impulse on your familiar more than once per day, it dies as soon as it returns the second time.
