# Conduit of Void and Vitality `pf2:2`
## Feat 16
### [[cursebound]][[divine]][[oracle]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** any oracle mystery
* * *
**Requirements** You have [[Spells/Heal|Heal]] or [[Spells/Harm|Harm]] as a signature spell and an available spell slot to cast it with.

* * *

You use the unstable energy of your curse to manipulate the most basic of divine magic. You cast a 3-action _heal_ or _harm_ spell, expending the slot as normal. If the spell restores Hit Points to one or more creatures, then one creature healed by this spell regains a number of additional Hit Points equal to 1d8 × your [[Conditions/Cursebound|Cursebound]] value; if the spell damages one or more creatures, then one creature harmed by this spell takes additional damage equal to 1d8 × your cursebound value.
