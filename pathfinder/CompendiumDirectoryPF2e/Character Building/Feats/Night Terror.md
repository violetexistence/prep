# Night Terror
## Feat 16
### [[mythic]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Apocalypse Rider Dedication
* * *
Buoyed by your fearsome reputation, your steed can take flight. Your apocalypse mount gains a fly Speed equal to its land Speed. If it already has a fly speed, it gains a +2 circumstance bonus to Acrobatics checks to [[Actions/Maneuver in Flight|Maneuver in Flight]]. At night, or in any environment deprived of natural sunlight, your apocalypse mount gains a +10-foot circumstance bonus to its fly Speed, and critical failures on Acrobatics checks to Maneuver in Flight become failures instead.
