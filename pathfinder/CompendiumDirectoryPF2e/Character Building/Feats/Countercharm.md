# Countercharm `pf2:r`
## Feat 8
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Captivator Dedication
* * *
**Trigger** A creature Casts a Spell from the enchantment or illusion school.

**Requirements** You have an innate non-cantrip captivator spell of the same school.

* * *

Your enchantments and illusions are so dominant that you can use them to counteract similar magic cast by others. When a foe casts an enchantment or illusion spell and you can see its manifestations, you can use your own innate magic to disrupt it. You lose an innate, non-cantrip spell of the same school as the triggering spell as if you had Cast the Spell. You then attempt to counteract the triggering spell with your spell.
