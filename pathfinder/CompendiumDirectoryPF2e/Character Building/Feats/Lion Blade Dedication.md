**Access** You're from Taldor.

Your Lion Blade spy training helps you conceal yourself and your identity. You become trained in your choice of Deception or Stealth; if you were already trained in that skill, you become an expert instead. You also gain the [[Feats/Additional Lore|Additional Lore]] skill feat for Espionage Lore. If you were already trained in Espionage Lore, you also become trained in a Lore skill of your choice.

You never take circumstance penalties for attempting to take a disguise of a different ancestry, age, and so on, as long as the disguised form is appropriate for your size.
