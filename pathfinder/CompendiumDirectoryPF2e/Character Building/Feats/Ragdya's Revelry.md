# Ragdya's Revelry `pf2:r`
## Feat 5
### [[vanara]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** An adjacent creature you can see fails an attack roll against you.

* * *

You dart away from your foe's attack with a casual laugh, using the opening to cause mischief. You attempt to [[Actions/Steal|Steal]] an item from the triggering creature, ignoring the usual restriction that the creature can't be in combat.
