You've learned Devrin Arlos's guileful ways, and his sly teachings help you remind your allies to keep their wits about them. When you use this action, attempt a `Deception check` check. The DC is usually a standard-difficulty DC of your level, but the GM can assign a different DC based on the circumstances. The effect depends on the result of your check.
