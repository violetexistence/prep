# Disillusionment
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** bonus; 



**Prerequisites** Order of the Rack
* * *
Dreams are pointless illusions you seek to quash. If you roll a success on a saving throw against an illusion or dream effect or a Perception check to disbelieve an illusion, you get a critical success instead. If you roll a critical failure on any of those checks, you get a failure instead.
