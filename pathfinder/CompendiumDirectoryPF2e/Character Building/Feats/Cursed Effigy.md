# Cursed Effigy `pf2:1`
## Feat 8
### [[curse]][[thaumaturge]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Exploit Vulnerability
* * *
**Requirements** Your last action was a successful Strike against the target of your [[Actions/Exploit Vulnerability|Exploit Vulnerability]], and the Strike dealt physical damage.

* * *

After your attack, you grab a bit of blood, cut hair, or other piece of the creature's body. You incorporate the material into a premade doll, paper figure, or other effigy to create a sympathetic link that makes it harder to resist your abilities. As long as you are Exploiting Vulnerability against that creature, it takes a -2 status penalty to its saving throws against thaumaturge abilities or items that use your thaumaturge class DC.
