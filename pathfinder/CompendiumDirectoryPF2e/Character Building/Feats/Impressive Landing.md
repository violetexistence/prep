# Impressive Landing `pf2:r`
## Feat 10
### [[barbarian]]

**Category** class; 




**Trigger** You fall at least 10 feet and land on a solid surface.

* * *

You slam into the ground, shattering it around you. Treat the fall as 10 feet shorter. You land on your feet. The ground in a 5-foot emanation becomes difficult terrain. Any creature in the emanation when you land takes 5 bludgeoning damage as the debris hits it and is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the start of its next turn.
