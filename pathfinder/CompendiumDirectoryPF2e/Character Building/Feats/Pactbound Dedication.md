# Pactbound Dedication
## Feat 2
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[archetype]][[dedication]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Erutaki or Jotun language; trained in Nature; must have earned the trust of a saumen kar who initiates you into the archetype
* * *
You befriended one of the last saumen kar and were infused with a fraction of their power, granting you the potential to become a guardian of their ancient pact. You gain cold resistance equal to half your level. You can [[Actions/Hide|Hide]] and [[Actions/Sneak|Sneak]] while it's snowing even lightly, even if it wouldn't be thick enough to normally grant concealment. Finally, all saumen kar can sense the mark of their pact upon you, and their attitude toward you is typically one step better than it would be otherwise (hostile to unfriendly, unfriendly to indifferent, etc.) Most saumen kar are unfriendly to outsiders; this would make them indifferent to you.
