# Shifting Faces
## Feat 5
### [[kitsune]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** tailless alternate form
* * *
**Frequency** once per day

* * *

You wear many faces, even those that don't belong to you. When you Change Shape into your tailless form, you gain the effects of 3rd-rank [[Spells/Illusory Disguise|Illusory Disguise]] for 1 hour or until you shift back, except it's a transmutation effect rather than an illusion.
