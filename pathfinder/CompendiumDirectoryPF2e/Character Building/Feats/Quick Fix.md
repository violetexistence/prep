# Quick Fix
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Talisman Dabbler Dedication
* * *
You can attach a talisman using only a bit of glue and some string. You gain the [[Feats/Rapid Affixture|Rapid Affixture]] skill feat, even if you don't meet the prerequisites. When you use it, you can affix or remove up to four talismans in 1 minute instead of just one.

You gain the ability to [[Actions/Affix a Talisman|Affix a Talisman]] as a 3-action activity from that feat at 12th level, regardless of your Crafting proficiency.
