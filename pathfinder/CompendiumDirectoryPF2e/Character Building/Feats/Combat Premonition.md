# Combat Premonition
## Feat 12
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Chronoskimmer Dedication
* * *
By narrowing your sense of the future, you can improve that of your allies. When you roll initiative, instead of stabilizing or destabilizing your own timestream, you can grant your allies a flash of insight into their future. Choose two allies. Those allies roll their initiative roll twice and take the better result; this is a fortune effect. You roll your initiative roll twice and take the worse result; this is a misfortune effect. The two effects are tied together: if you would avoid the misfortune effect for any reason, or if any of your allies would negate their fortune effect, your Combat Premonition does nothing.
