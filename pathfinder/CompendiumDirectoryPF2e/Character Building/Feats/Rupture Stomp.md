# Rupture Stomp `pf2:2`
## Feat 8
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** stalwart defender dedication
* * *
**Frequency** once per day

**Requirements** You are in Tenacious Stance.

* * *

Every dwarf knows that the rock they walk upon can be either a best friend or a treacherous path. With a heavy impact of your armored heel, you crack the ground underneath you. The ground within a 10-foot emanation becomes difficult terrain. If you are a master or better in the armor you are wearing, this becomes greater difficult terrain. The cracked ground settles and reverts to normal terrain after 1 minute.

* * *

**Special** At 16th level, you can take this feat again. If you do, you can use it once per hour instead of once per day.
