# Impressive Mount
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Cavalier Dedication
* * *
You've trained your mount to become a powerful force on the battlefield. The mount you gained through the [[Feats/Cavalier Dedication|Cavalier Dedication]] feat becomes a mature animal companion, granting it additional capabilities.

Your mount has greater independence. During an encounter, even if you don't use the [[Actions/Command an Animal|Command an Animal]] action, your mount can still use 1 action that round on your turn to [[Actions/Stride|Stride]] or [[Actions/Strike|Strike]]. It can do this at any point during your turn, as long as you aren't currently taking an action. If it does, that's all the actions it gets that roundâ€”you can't Command it later.
