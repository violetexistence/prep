# Gladiator's Roar `pf2:2`
## Feat 12
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[archetype]][[emotion]][[fear]][[mental]][[sonic]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Gladiator Dedication; master in Intimidation
* * *
**Frequency** once per day

* * *

You can project your voice into a high-pitched screech that damages your foes. Your roar can be heard twice as far as normal, and creatures within a 15-foot cone take 6d10 sonic damage and must attempt a `Fortitude check` save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. If your Gladiator's Roar triggers Play to the Crowd, you gain a +2 status bonus to your Performance check to do so.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature takes half damage and becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]]

**Failure** The creature takes full damage and becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]].

**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage, becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 3]], and is [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]].
