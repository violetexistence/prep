# Divine Guidance
## Feat 15
### [[general]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** legendary in Religion
* * *
You're so immersed in divine scripture that you find meaning and guidance for any situation in your texts. Spend 10 minutes [[Actions/Decipher Writing|Deciphering Writing]] on religious scriptures of your deity or philosophy while thinking about a particular problem or conundrum you face, and then attempt a Religion check (DC determined by the GM). If you succeed, you unearth a relevant passage, parable, or aphorism that can help you move forward or change your thinking to help solve your conundrum.
