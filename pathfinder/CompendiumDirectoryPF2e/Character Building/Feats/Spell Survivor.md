# Spell Survivor
## Feat 5
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[orc]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Once you've resisted an opponent's magic, anything else they throw your way becomes less effective. When you attempt a saving throw against a spell using [[Feats/Orc Superstition|Orc Superstition]] or [[Feats/Pervasive Superstition|Pervasive Superstition]] and critically succeed, you gain resistance 1 to all damage dealt by that triggering spell's caster until the end of their next turn. At 9th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the resistance increases by 1.
