# Solar Detonation `pf2:3`
## Feat 8
### [[fire]][[impulse]][[incapacitation]][[kineticist]][[overflow]][[primal]][[vitality]]

**Category** class; 




Blinding flames explode in a swirling sphere! The detonation fills a 20-foot burst within 60 feet of you. Each creature in the area takes 2d6 fire + -2d6 vitality damage, and can become [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] or [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] depending on the result of its `Reflex check` save. The light from Solar Detonation is sunlight for creatures with a particular vulnerability to sunlight. Each creature that attempts a save becomes temporarily immune to being dazzled or blinded by Solar Detonation for 10 minutes, but not the impulse's other effects.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature takes half damage and is dazzled until the start of your next turn.

**Failure** The creature takes full damage and is blinded until the start of your next turn.

**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and is blinded for 1 minute.

* * *

**Level (+2)** Increase the fire damage by 1d6 and the vitality damage by 1d6.
