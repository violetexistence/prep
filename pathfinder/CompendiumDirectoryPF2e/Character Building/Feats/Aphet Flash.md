# Aphet Flash `pf2:1`
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]][[flourish]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Swarmkeeper Dedication
* * *
**Requirements** Your swarm is outside your body.

* * *

Your swarm can emit a bright flash, much like aphet beetles, a genus of flash beetles once used by Osirian miners as sources of light. Each creature in its space must succeed at a `Fortitude check` save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher, or be [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] for 1 round (2 rounds on a critical failure). The swarm then glows with light like a torch until it returns to your body.
