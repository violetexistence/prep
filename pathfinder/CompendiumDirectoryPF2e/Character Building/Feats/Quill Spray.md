# Quill Spray `pf2:2`
## Feat 9
### [[shisk]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** quillcoat shisk or quill unarmed attack
* * *
**Frequency** once per day

* * *

You can launch a mass of quills at opponents. You spray quills in a 30-foot cone, dealing 1d8 piercing damage. Each creature in the area must attempt a `Reflex check` saving throw against the higher of your class DC or spell DC. On a critical failure, a creature also takes 1 bleed damage. At 11th level and every even level thereafter, the piercing damage increases by 1d8 and the persistent bleed damage increases by 1.

* * *

_**Note** The feat does not specify the type of saving throw required. A reflex saving throw has been added, in line with Barbed Quills._
