# Storied Companion `pf2:r`
## Feat 2
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[fortune]][[mythic]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Handler's Calling; you have an animal companion or pet
* * *
**Trigger** Your animal companion or pet would fail a saving throw.

* * *

Your companion is an integral part of your story, and you can expend your mythic power to protect it, defying events that would prevent it from being so. Spend a Mythic Point; your companion rerolls the triggering save at mythic proficiency and gains temporary Hit Points equal to twice your level that last for 1 minute.
