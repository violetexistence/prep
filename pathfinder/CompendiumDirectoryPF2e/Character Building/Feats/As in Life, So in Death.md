# As in Life, So in Death
## Feat 1
### [[skeleton]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Specific memories of your old life are hard to hold onto, but you know things without remembering why. You gain the [[Feats/Adopted Ancestry|Adopted Ancestry]] feat. You can choose any ancestry, but it is likely to be one that matches both your skeleton heritage and who you were in life. As long as your body is completely covered by armor or clothing, you do not have to attempt Deception checks against a creature's Perception DC to successfully Impersonate yourself as a member of that ancestry. This is a non-magical disguise that doesn't protect against divination. This disguise doesn't provide any benefit against a creature actively attempting a Perception check against you.
