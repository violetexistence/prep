**Category** class; 




Drawing on your connection to the Plane of Earth, you form a wall of rock and earth. This has the effect of [[Spells/Wall of Stone|Wall of Stone]], but the wall's maximum length is 40 feet. The wall lasts until the end of your next turn, but you can Sustain it up to 1 minute.

**Level (+4)** The maximum length of the wall increases by 10 feet, and the Hit Points of each section increase by 5.
