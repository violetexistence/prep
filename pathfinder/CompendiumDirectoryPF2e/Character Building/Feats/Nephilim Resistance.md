# Nephilim Resistance
## Feat 5
### [[nephilim]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You resist energy like your extraplanar predecessors. Choose one of the following energy damage types: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. You gain resistance 5 to that damage type.

The damage type typically matches an extraplanar entity associated with your bloodline. For instance, an [[Feats/Angelkin|Angelkin]] might choose resistance to cold, while a [[Feats/Hellspawn|Hellspawn]] might choose resistance to fire.
