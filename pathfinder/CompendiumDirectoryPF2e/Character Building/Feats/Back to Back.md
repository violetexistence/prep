# Back to Back
## Feat 8
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Marshal Dedication
* * *
You excel at watching your allies' backs and helping them watch yours. Any ally adjacent to you can't be [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] due to flanking unless you're also flanked. Similarly, while you're adjacent to at least one ally, you can't be off-guard due to flanking unless at least one ally you're adjacent to is flanked as well.
