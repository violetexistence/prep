## Feat 5
### [[catfolk]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You can demonstrate how to quickly twist out of the way of dangerous effects. You can use the [[Actions/Aid|Aid]] reaction to grant a bonus to an ally's Reflex save. As usual for Aid, you need to prepare by using an action on your turn to encourage the ally.
