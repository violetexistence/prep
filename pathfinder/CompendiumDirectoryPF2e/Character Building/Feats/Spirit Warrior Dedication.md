## Feat 2
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[archetype]][[dedication]]

**Category** class; 




**Access** Tian Xia origin

* * *

You're a warrior who trains your spirit and body to work in perfect harmony, enhancing your attacks with your spiritual energy while fighting with a ferocious martial technique that combines blade and fist.

The damage die for your fist changes to 1d6 instead of 1d4, and your fist gains the parry trait. You don't take the normal â€“2 circumstance penalty when making a lethal attack with your fist or any other unarmed attacks. You gain the [[Actions/Overwhelming Combination|Overwhelming Combination]] action.
