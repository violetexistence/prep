# Germination of Resolve `pf2:0`
## Feat 13
### [[yaksha]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per day

* * *

Vitality floods your trammeled soul, offering you rejuvenation, if not quite rest. For each effect that causes the [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled]] or [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]] conditions to affect you, attempt a `Nature check` check to counteract that effect. The counteract rank of Germination of Resolve is equal to half your level rounded up.
