# Safe Elements
## Feat 4
### [[kineticist]]

**Category** class; 




Elements are wild and dangerous, but you've found ways to reduce their risk. When you Channel Elements or use a stance impulse that affects your kinetic aura, you can designate a number of creatures up to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1 creature). Choose whether they are immune to the benefits of your kinetic aura or immune to its damage and drawbacks. You don't have to be able to see a creature to designate it, nor does it need to be in your kinetic aura, but you can't designate a creature that's unnoticed by you.

In addition, you gain the [[Actions/Pacifying Infusion|Pacifying Infusion]] action.
