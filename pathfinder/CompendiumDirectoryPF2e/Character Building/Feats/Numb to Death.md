# Numb to Death
## Feat 7
### [[general]]

**Category** general; 



**Prerequisites** Diehard; You have died at least once

Your past has left you numb to death's call. The first time each day that you regain Hit Points while you are dying, you gain a circumstance bonus to the number of Hit Points you regain equal to your level, and you neither gain the wounded condition nor increase the value of this condition.
