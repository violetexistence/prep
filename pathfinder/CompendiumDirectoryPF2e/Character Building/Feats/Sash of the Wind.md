# Sash of the Wind
## Feat 9
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[leshy]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Access** Tian Xia origin

* * *

At your request, the nature spirits of the air and wind spin themselves into an iridescent sash loosely draped around your shoulders that buoys you through the sky. You can cast [[Spells/Fly|Fly]] on yourself as a 4th-rank innate primal spell once per day. If the sash created by this feat is removed, the spell immediately ends.
