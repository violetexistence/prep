# Statue `pf2:1`
## Feat 8
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Stonebound Dedication
* * *
Your body and equipment appear to be made of stone as you hold perfectly still. Until the next time you act, you appear to be a statue and do not need to eat, drink, or breathe, but you are [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]]. Your Deception DC to pass as a statue is equal to 10 + your proficiency bonus (do not apply any other bonuses, penalties, or modifiers).
