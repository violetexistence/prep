# Healing Transformation `pf2:1`
## Feat 10
### [[druid]][[spellshape]]

**Category** class; 




You can take advantage of shapechanging magic to close wounds and patch injuries. If your next action is to cast a non-cantrip polymorph spell that targets only one creature, your polymorph spell also restores 1d6 Hit Points per spell rank to that creature. This is a healing effect.
