# Guiding Luck
## Feat 9
### [[halfling]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Halfling Luck
* * *
Your luck guides you to look the right way and aim your blows unerringly. You can use Halfling Luck twice per day: once in response to its normal trigger, and once when you fail a Perception check or attack roll instead of the normal trigger.
