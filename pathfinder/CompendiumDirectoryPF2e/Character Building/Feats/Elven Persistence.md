# Elven Persistence `pf2:0`
## Feat 5
### [[elf]][[fortune]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** You fail a skill check you're at least trained in.

* * *

Elves don't give up easily on their pursuits. Instead of the result you received for the triggering skill check, you receive a result of 12 + your proficiency bonus (don't apply any other bonuses, penalties, or modifiers).
