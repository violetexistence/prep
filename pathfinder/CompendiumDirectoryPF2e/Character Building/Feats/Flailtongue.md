# Flailtongue
## Feat 10
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Ghoul Dedication
* * *
Your tongue has mutated into a lashing weapon reminiscent of Kabriri's bone-laden flail. You can use a free action to unhinge your lower jaw and sprout rigid bones from your tongue. You gain an unarmed attack that deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage. Until you use an Interact action to reset your jaw and retract your tongue, you can't make a jaws Strike. Your flailtongue is in the flail weapon group and has the disarm, sweep, and trip traits.
