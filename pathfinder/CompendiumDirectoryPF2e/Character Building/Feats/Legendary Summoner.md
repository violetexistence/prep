# Legendary Summoner
## Feat 20
### [[summoner]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Master Summoner
* * *
Your ability to summon extends past your other spellcasting. When you sacrifice a 9th-rank spell slot to gain two summoning slots using Master Summoner, you can use those slots to cast summoning spells heightened to 10th rank.

You can't use these spell slots for any purpose other than casting the summoning spells, and you don't count as having 10th-rank spell slots for other abilities or rules.
