# One More Activation
## Feat 6
### [[thaumaturge]]

**Category** class; 




You've forged a deeper bond to your invested items, allowing you to activate them more than usual. Once each day, you can Activate an Item you've invested even after you've used that activation the maximum number of times for its frequency. You can do so only if the item's level is half your level or lower, the activation has a frequency of once per day or more frequent, and you haven't already used the activation this round.
