# Alchemical Discoveries
## Feat 4
### [[investigator]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** alchemical sciences methodology
* * *
You've devoted extra time in the lab to improve your knowledge of alchemy. You learn the formulas for two alchemical items each time you level up instead of one; these must still be elixirs or tools. The number of versatile vials you can create each day increases by one if you're an expert in Crafting, two if you're a master, or three if you're legendary.
