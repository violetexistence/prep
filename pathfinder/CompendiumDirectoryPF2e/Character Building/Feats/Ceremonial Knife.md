# Ceremonial Knife
## Feat 6
### [[witch]]

**Category** class; 




You have prepared a special knife to direct energies when spellcasting. During your daily preparations, you and your familiar can perform a short ritual over a weapon in the knife groupâ€”typically a dagger. This causes the knife to function as a magic wand, containing any one 1st-rank spell your familiar knows. You, and only you, can Activate the knife to Cast the Spell within it, as normal for a wand. You can attempt to overcharge the knife, and this can break or destroy the knife as normal. You can have only one ceremonial knife at a time.

At 8th level, and every 2 levels thereafter, the maximum rank of spell your ceremonial knife can hold increases by 1.
