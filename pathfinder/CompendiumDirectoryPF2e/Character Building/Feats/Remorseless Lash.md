# Remorseless Lash
## Feat 1
### [[hobgoblin]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You're skilled at beating an enemy when their morale is already breaking. When you succeed at a melee weapon Strike against a [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened]] enemy, that enemy can't reduce their frightened condition below 1 until the beginning of your next turn.
