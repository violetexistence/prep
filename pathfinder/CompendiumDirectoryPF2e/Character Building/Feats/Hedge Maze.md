# Hedge Maze `pf2:3`
## Feat 12
### [[impulse]][[kineticist]][[overflow]][[plant]][[primal]][[wood]]

**Category** class; 




You sculpt a manicured maze of hedges. Up to 10 hedges spring from the ground where you choose in a 30-foot-square area within 120 feet. Each is 10 feet long, 5 feet wide, and 15 feet tall. The hedges grant standard cover, are difficult terrain, and have a Climb DC of 15. They last until the end of your next turn, and you can Sustain the impulse up to 1 minute.

You can spend 10 minutes using this impulse as an exploration activity to instead create a cozy cabin with hedges for walls. It lasts for 12 hours, but ends if you use the impulse again.
