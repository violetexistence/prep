# Advanced First Aid
## Feat 7
### [[general]][[healing]][[manipulate]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** master in Medicine
* * *
You use your medical training to ameliorate sickness or assuage fears. When you use Medicine to [[Actions/Administer First Aid|Administer First Aid]], instead of Stabilizing a character or Stopping Bleeding, you can reduce an ally's [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened]] or [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened]] condition by 2, or remove either of those conditions entirely on a critical success. You can remove only one condition at a time. The DC for the Medicine check is usually the DC of the effect that caused the condition.
