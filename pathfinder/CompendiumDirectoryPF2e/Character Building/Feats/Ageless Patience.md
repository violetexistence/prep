# Ageless Patience
## Feat 5
### [[elf]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You work at a pace born from longevity that enhances your thoroughness. You can voluntarily spend twice as much time as normal on a Perception check or skill check that takes 1 action or longer. If you do, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the check and don't automatically reduce your degree of success on a natural 1 (you get a critical failure only if your result is 10 lower than the DC). For example, you could get these benefits if you spent 2 actions to [[Actions/Seek|Seek]], which normally takes 1 action. You can get these benefits during exploration by taking twice as long exploring as normal, or in downtime by spending twice as much downtime.

The GM might determine a situation doesn't grant you a benefit if a delay would be directly counterproductive to your success, such as a tense negotiation with an impatient creature.
