# Flensing Slice `pf2:1`
## Feat 8
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Dual-Weapon Warrior Dedication
* * *
**Requirements** Your last action was a [[Feats/Double Slice|Double Slice]], and both attacks hit the target.

* * *

When you hit with both attacks with Double Slice, you flense the target, making it bleed and creating a weak spot.

The target takes 1d8 bleed per weapon damage die of whichever of the weapons you used that has the most weapon damage dice (maximum 4d8 for a _major striking_ weapon).

The target becomes off-guard, and its resistances to any physical damage types are reduced by 5; these two effects last until the beginning of your next turn.
