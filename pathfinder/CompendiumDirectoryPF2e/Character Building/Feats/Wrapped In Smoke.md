# Wrapped In Smoke `pf2:1`
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Munitions Master Dedication
* * *
You ignite a small portion of powder in a rapid, inefficient burn, creating a hazy cloud. You create a cloud of smoke in a 5-foot emanation centered on your innovation, which lasts for 1 minute. All creatures and objects within the smoke become [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]], and those outside the smoke become concealed to those within.
