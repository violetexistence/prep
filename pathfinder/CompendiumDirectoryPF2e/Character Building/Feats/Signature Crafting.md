# Signature Crafting
## Feat 7
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[general]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** master in Crafting; Magical Crafting
* * *
Magic items you create bear a stamp specific to your handiwork. When you successfully Craft a permanent magic item, roll a `DC 9 Flat check` when the item is fully complete. Any benefit a creature gains from an item quirk applies only while the creature wears the item (for a worn item) or holds it (for a held item). The GM might allow custom quirks similar to those listed.

* * *

**Critical Success** Choose an item quirk from the table and its specifics.

**Success** The item gains a random item quirk with any specifics selected by the GM.
