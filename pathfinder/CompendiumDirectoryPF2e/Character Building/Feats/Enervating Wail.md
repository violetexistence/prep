# Enervating Wail `pf2:2`
## Feat 6
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[auditory]][[deviant]][[magical]]

**Category** class; 




You release a terrible wail that tears at the spirits of all nearby. All living creatures in a 20-foot emanation take -1d6 void damage with a `Fortitude check` save. The damage is 4d6, plus 1d6 for every level you have beyond 6th.

* * *

**Awakening** Your scream echoes in the mind. You can choose to emit a silent psychic wail instead, which changes the damage type to -1d6 mental, changes the save to a `Will check` save, removes the auditory trait, and adds the mental trait.

* * *

**Awakening** Your wail saps your foes' strength. In addition to the normal effects, living creatures in the area are [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]] for 1 round on a success (but not a critical success), enfeebled 1 for 1 minute on a failure, and [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 2]] for 1 minute on a critical failure.
