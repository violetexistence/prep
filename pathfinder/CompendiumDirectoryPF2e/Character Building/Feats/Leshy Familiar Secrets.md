# Leshy Familiar Secrets
## Feat 4
### [[druid]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** leaf order
* * *
The leaf order's secrets allow your familiar to take advantage of its leshy form. You can select one additional familiar ability each day, which must be one of the following leshy familiar abilities. You can't select more than one ability from this feat at a time.

*   **[[Familiar Abilities/Grasping Tendrils|Grasping Tendrils]]** Your familiar can extend vines or similar tendrils, increasing its reach to 15 feet.
*   **[[Familiar Abilities/Purify Air|Purify Air]]** Your familiar recycles air, providing enough oxygen for a Medium creature in areas with stale air, such as a sealed chamber or extradimensional space. Creatures within a 15-foot emanation of the leshy gain a +2 circumstance bonus to their saving throws against inhaled poison effects, olfactory effects, or other effects that rely on breathing (such as toxic cloud), at the GM's discretion.
*   **[[Familiar Abilities/Verdant Burst|Verdant Burst]]** When your familiar dies, it releases its primal energy to cast the 3-action version of [[Spells/Heal|Heal]], heightened to a rank 1 lower than your highest-rank spell slot. The _heal_ spell gains a status bonus equal to twice the spell's rank to the Hit Points it restores to plants. You must be able to cast 2nd-rank spells using spell slots to select this familiar ability.
