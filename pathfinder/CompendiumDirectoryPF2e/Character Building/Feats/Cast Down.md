## Feat 6
### [[cleric]][[concentrate]][[spellshape]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** harmful font or healing font
* * *
The sheer force of your faith can bring a foe crashing down. If the next action you use is to cast [[Spells/Harm|Harm]] or [[Spells/Heal|Heal]] to damage one creature, the target is knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] if it takes any damage from the spell. If the target critically fails its save against the spell, it also takes a â€“10-foot status penalty to its Speed for 1 minute.
