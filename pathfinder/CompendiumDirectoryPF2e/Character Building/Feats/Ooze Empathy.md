# Ooze Empathy
## Feat 8
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Oozemorph Dedication; at least two other class feats from the Oozemorph archetype
* * *
You can connect with oozes (and other amorphous aberrations, at the GM's discretion) on a rudimentary level. You can use Diplomacy to [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] on oozes and to make very simple [[Actions/Request|Requests]] of them. In most instances, oozes will give you time to make your case.
