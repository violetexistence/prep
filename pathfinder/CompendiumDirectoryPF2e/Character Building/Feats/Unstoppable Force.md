# Unstoppable Force
## Feat 18
### [[mythic]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Eternal Legend Dedication; Immovable Object
* * *
While you are in the stance provided by [[Feats/Immovable Object|Immovable Object]], you ignore difficult terrain and greater difficult terrain. Once per 10 minutes, if you Dismiss your Immovable Object stance, you can Stride as a free action. At the end of that Stride, your final footfall causes an explosion of energy. Each creature within a 20-foot emanation takes 14d6 force damage (`Reflex check` save against your class DC). Creatures that fail the save are also knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]].
