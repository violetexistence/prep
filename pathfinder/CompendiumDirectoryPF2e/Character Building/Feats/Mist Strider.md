# Mist Strider
## Feat 13
### [[azarketi]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Water Strider
* * *
You condense the moisture in the air, solidifying it so it can hold your weight. When you use [[Feats/Water Strider|Water Strider]], you can walk on air. You can ascend and descend at a maximum of a 45-degree angle. You still fall at the end of your movement if you don't end on a surface that can support you, as normal for Water Strider.
