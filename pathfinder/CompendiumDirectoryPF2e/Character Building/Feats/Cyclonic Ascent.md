# Cyclonic Ascent `pf2:2`
## Feat 8
### [[air]][[impulse]][[kineticist]][[primal]]

**Category** class; 




Whorls of wind surround your lower body, forming a cyclone that lifts you into the air. You gain a fly Speed equal to your land Speed or 30 feet, whichever is greater, for 10 minutes. Unlike with a normal fly Speed, you can move upward without treating it as difficult terrain. In addition, you can remain in the air at the end of your turn if you used an air impulse during that turn, even if you didn't use a Fly action that turn.

**Level (14th)** You can target up to five additional creatures, each of which gains a fly Speed equal to its land Speed or 30 feet, whichever is greater. They don't gain the other benefits.
