# Catch and Kill `pf2:r`
## Feat 12
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Venture-Gossip Archetype
* * *
**Trigger** A creature within your reach uses a move action, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.

* * *

When you've decided to quash a story, no one can escape from you with any incriminating information. Make a melee Strike against the triggering creature. On a hit, the triggering creature is Grabbed, and on a critical hit, they're [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]]. This Strike doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike.
