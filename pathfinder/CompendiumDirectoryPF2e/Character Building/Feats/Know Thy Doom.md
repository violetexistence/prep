# Know Thy Doom `pf2:r`
## Feat 12
### [[archetype]][[fortune]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Warrior of Legend Dedication
* * *
**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** You are [[Conditions/Doomed|Doomed 1]] or greater and your [[Conditions/Dying|Dying]] value would increase.

* * *

As your legend grows, details of your demise become clearer. And you know that it is not yet your time. You can attempt a recovery check using your dying value before it increases, rolling twice and taking the better result. Regardless of the outcome, reduce your doomed value by 1.
