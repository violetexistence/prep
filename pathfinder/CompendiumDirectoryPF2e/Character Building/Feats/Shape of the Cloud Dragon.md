# Shape of the Cloud Dragon
## Feat 14
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Dragon Disciple Dedication
* * *
You've discovered how to transform yourself into a cloud dragon. Once per day, you can cast 7th-rank [[Spells/Dragon Form|Dragon Form]] as an innate arcane spell, transforming into a cloud dragon. The spell automatically heightens to 8th level if you're 16th level and 9th rank if you're 18th level.

On a critical hit with an unarmed Strike gained from dragon form, you recharge the spell's breath weapon immediately.

While in this form, you gain the following cloud dragon-specific abilities:

*   **Cloud** cloud walk (you can walk on clouds or fog);
    *   **Melee** `pf2:1` jaws, **Damage** 2d10 piercing plus 1d12 electricity;
    *   **Melee** `pf2:1` claw (agile), **Damage** 3d10 slashing;
    *   **Melee** `pf2:1` tail (reach 10 feet), **Damage** 3d10 bludgeoning;
    *   **Melee** `pf2:1` horn (reach 10 feet), **Damage** 3d8 piercing;
    *   Breath Weapon 30-foot cone, 6d12 electricity.

* * *

**Special** You can use this feat in place of [[Feats/Shape of the Dragon|Shape of the Dragon]] to fulfill feat requirements.
