# Late Awakener
## Feat 5
### [[awakened-animal]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** You have a versatile heritage.
* * *
Whether due to a more gradual process or your animal and sapient sides being especially in conflict, your awakening was a little slower than most, but your eyes are now fully open and your abilities have returned. You gain all the mechanical benefits of the awakened animal heritage you selected at 1st level, allowing you to take feats and gain any benefits that require a specific awakened animal heritage.
