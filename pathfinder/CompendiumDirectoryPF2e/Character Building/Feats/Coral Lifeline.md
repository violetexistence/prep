# Coral Lifeline
## Feat 17
### [[athamaru]][[healing]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Coral Symbiotes
* * *
**Frequency** once per day

* * *

Your coral symbiotes have grown into your bloodstream and are now curled around your heart. When you would die, the coral in your body releases a burst of healing energy. This prevents you from dying and restores 4d8 healing Hit Points. Once this ability is used, the coral fades to a dull gray and gives you no benefits until you complete your next daily preparations.
