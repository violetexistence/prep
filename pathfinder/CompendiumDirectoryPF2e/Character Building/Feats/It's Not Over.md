# It's Not Over `pf2:r`
## Feat 14
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Celebrity or Gladiator Dedication
* * *
**Trigger** You're reduced to 0 Hit Points

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

In the world of drama, the finale of any performance doesn't have to be the end, and for you, this now extends to life itself. When damage reduces you to 0 Hit Points, you can use this reaction to suddenly spring back into action. Instead of gaining the dying condition and falling [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]], you regain a number of Hit Points equal to 10 + your level + your Constitution modifier.
