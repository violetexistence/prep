# Lethal Finisher `pf2:1`

### [[death]][[finisher]][[swashbuckler]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** precise strike 6d6

You stab your foe in a vital organ, possibly killing them outright. Make a Strike. On a success, you forego your precise strike damage from the finisher.

Instead, your target takes additional precision damage based on a `Fortitude check` save against your class DC. If your Strike was a critical hit, the target's saving throw outcome is one degree worse.

**Critical Success** You deal 6 precision damage.

**Success** You deal 6d6 precision damage.

**Failure** You deal 12d6 precision damage.

**Critical Failure** You deal 18d6 precision damage.
