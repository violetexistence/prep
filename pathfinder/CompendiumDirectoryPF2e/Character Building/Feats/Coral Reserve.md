# Coral Reserve `pf2:1`
## Feat 13
### [[athamaru]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Coral Symbiotes
* * *
**Frequency** once per day

**Requirements** You are [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled]] or [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]].

* * *

Your coral symbiotes provide a store of energy that you can call upon when needed. You suppress your enfeebled or fatigued condition. (If you're affected by both, choose one to suppress.) After 1 minute, the condition returns with any remaining duration it had when you suppressed it.
