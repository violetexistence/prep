# Sleeper Hold `pf2:1`
## Feat 10
### [[incapacitation]][[monk]]

**Category** class; 




**Requirements** You have a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]].

* * *

You pinch crucial points of your target's nervous system, impeding its ability to function. Attempt an Athletics check to [[Actions/Grapple|Grapple]] the creature, with the following success and critical success effects instead of the usual effects.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target falls [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]] for 1 minute, though it remains standing and doesn't drop what it holds.

**Success** The target is [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] until the end of its next turn.
