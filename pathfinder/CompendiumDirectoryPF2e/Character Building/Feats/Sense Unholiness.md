# Sense Unholiness
## Feat 8
### [[champion]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** holy
* * *
You sense the truly wicked as a queasy or foreboding feeling. You can sense the presence of creatures with the unholy trait within 120 feet. This functions as a vague sense, similar to humans' sense of smell. An unholy creature using a disguise or otherwise trying to hide its presence attempts a `Deception check` check against your Perception DC to hide its sanctification from you. If the creature succeeds at its Deception check, it is then temporarily immune to your Sense Unholiness for 1 day.
