# Wild Dance `pf2:1`
## Feat 12
### [[archetype]][[flourish]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Wylderheart Dedication
* * *
The combination of your passion for both life and the battle against evil makes you graceful and unpredictable. Stride up to your Speed. A creature that attempts a reaction triggered by this movement must first attempt a `Will check` save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature is [[Conditions/Fascinated|Fascinated]] by you until the end of your next turn.

**Failure** The creature is fascinated by you until the end of your next turn, but your movements might be too hard to follow; if the reaction requires an attack roll, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against that attack roll.

**Critical Failure** The creature is fascinated by you until the end of your next turn, and it loses its reaction.
