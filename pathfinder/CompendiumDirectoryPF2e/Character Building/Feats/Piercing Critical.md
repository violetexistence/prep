# Piercing Critical
## Feat 18
### [[gunslinger]]

**Category** class; 




Your attacks with your preferred weapons deal especially devastating wounds. When you Strike with a firearm or crossbow for which you have legendary proficiency, you critically succeed if you roll a 19 on the die, as long as that result is a success.
