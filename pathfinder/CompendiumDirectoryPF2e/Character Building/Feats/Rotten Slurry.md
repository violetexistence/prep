# Rotten Slurry `pf2:1`
## Feat 2
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[attack]][[deviant]][[magical]]

**Category** class; 




You expel a glob of rotten, foul-smelling slurry from your torso, hand, or mouth at a foe. Make a ranged attack roll against a creature within 30 feet. If you succeed, the slurry deals 0d4 bludgeoning damage to the target for every two levels you have, or double damage on a critical success. A creature that's damaged by the attack is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] ([[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]] on a critical success).

**Awakening** The slurry bursts, showering bystanders. The attack deals an additional 1d4 poison splash damage for every four levels you have.

**Awakening** The slurry is caustic, and bores into the flesh of those it touches. The attack deals an additional 1d4 persistent acid damage.
