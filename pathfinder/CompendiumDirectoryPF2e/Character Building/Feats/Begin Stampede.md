# Begin Stampede `pf2:3`
## Feat 17
### [[minotaur]][[visual]]

**Category** ancestry; 




The sight of you charging forward into battle emboldens your allies to follow. You Stride up to twice your Speed and make a horns melee Strike. If your Strike hits and damages an enemy, each ally within 60 feet who saw you hit can use a reaction to Stride up to twice their Speed, but each must end their Stride closer to you than where they started. Each such ally that Strides gains a +1 status bonus to their first Strike on their next turn.
