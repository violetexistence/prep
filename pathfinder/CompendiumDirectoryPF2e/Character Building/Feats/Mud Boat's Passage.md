# Mud Boat's Passage
## Feat 9
### [[primal]][[tanuki]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You instinctively create magical boats that keep your feet dry (mostly). You can walk on the surface of water and other non-damaging liquids, moving at half your normal Speed, as a magical boat forms under your feet to carry you. Unfortunately, this magical boat is made out of mud, so you can't get very farâ€”if you end your turn without reaching solid ground, the boat dissolves, and you sink.
