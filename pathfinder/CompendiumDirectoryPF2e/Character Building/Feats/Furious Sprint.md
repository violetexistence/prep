# Furious Sprint `pf2:2`
## Feat 10
### [[barbarian]][[rage]]

**Category** class; 




You rush forward. Stride up to five times, or up to eight times if you used 3 actions. All this movement must be in a straight line (though the GM might allow reasonable variance). You can replace any of these Strides with a [[Actions/Balance|Balance]] action if you need to, which you attempt using an [[Actions/balance skill=athletics|balance skill=athletics]]{Athletics} check instead of an Acrobatics check, using the same DC.
