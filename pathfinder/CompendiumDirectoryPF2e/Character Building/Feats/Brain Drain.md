# Brain Drain `pf2:2`
## Feat 8
### [[mental]][[occult]][[psyche]][[psychic]]

**Category** class; 




With a wresting of will, you siphon off a creature's mental energy to replenish your own. One non-mindless creature within 30 feet must attempt a `Will check` save against your spell DC.

* * *

**Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] for 1 minute, and you regain 1 Focus Point, up to your normal maximum. You can't use Brain Drain again until after the next time you make your daily preparations.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature is [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 2]].
