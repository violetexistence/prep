You use one-handed weapons to parry with style. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn, or a +2 circumstance bonus if you have a free hand or are wielding a weapon with the parry trait. You lose this circumstance bonus if you no longer meet this feat's requirement. If a creature misses you with a Strike while you have this bonus, you gain panache until the end of your next turn.
