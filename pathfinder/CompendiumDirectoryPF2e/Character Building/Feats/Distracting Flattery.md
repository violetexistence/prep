# Distracting Flattery `pf2:r`
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** Dandy Dedication; expert in Deception
* * *
**Trigger** You observe a target's attitude toward yourself or your allies decrease as a result of an ally's behavior.

* * *

You know how to maintain a good impression and manage your image, even while keeping uncouth company.

Make a `Deception check` check against the target's Will DC. Regardless of your result, the target is temporarily immune to your Distracting Flattery for 10 minutes.

* * *

**Success** The target's attitude doesn't decrease as a result of your ally's social blunder.

**Failure** The target's attitude decreases, as normal.

**Critical Failure** Your attempt makes matters worse, decreasing the target's attitude toward you by one step, in addition to any changes from the behavior that triggered this reaction.
