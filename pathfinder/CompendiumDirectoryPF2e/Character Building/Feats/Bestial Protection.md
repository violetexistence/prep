# Bestial Protection
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]][[emotion]][[fear]][[mental]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Beastmaster Dedication; animal companion that's Large or greater
* * *
Your companion's mere presence is enough to rattle creatures that fall under its shadow. When a creature adjacent to your animal companion that's smaller than it targets you with an attack, that creature becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]].
