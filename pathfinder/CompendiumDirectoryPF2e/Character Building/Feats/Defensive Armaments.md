# Defensive Armaments
## Feat 2
### [[gunslinger]]

**Category** class; 




You use bulky firearms or crossbows to shield your body. Any two-handed firearms and two-handed crossbows you wield gain the parry trait. If an appropriate weapon already has the parry trait, increase the circumstance bonus to AC it grants when used to parry from +1 to +2. While parrying with your weapon, you are immune to splash damage.
