# Meteoric Spellstrike `pf2:2`
## Feat 10
### [[arcane]][[magus]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Spellstrike; starlit span hybrid study
* * *
**Requirements** You're wielding a ranged or thrown weapon, or have a ranged unarmed attack.

* * *

A trail of energy flows from your target back to you. Make a Spellstrike with a ranged weapon or ranged unarmed attack against a target within the ranged weapon or unarmed attack's first range increment. The spell you cast for the Spellstrike can't be a cantrip or focus spell. Each creature in a line between you and the target, excluding you and the target, takes damage equal to double the spell's rank. Determine the damage type as described in Arcane Cascade.
