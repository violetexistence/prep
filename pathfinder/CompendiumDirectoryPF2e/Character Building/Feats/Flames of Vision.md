# Flames of Vision
## Feat 13
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[goblin]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Access** dokkaebi goblin heritage or Tian Xia origin

* * *

Dokkaebi were among the first goblins to pioneer gazing through flames, spectral or physical, to cast their senses far and wide. You can cast [[Spells/Clairvoyance|Clairvoyance]] as a 4th-rank innate occult spell twice per day. To see through the spell's eye, you must be staring into a source of fire.

* * *

**Special** If you can cast [[Spells/Ignition|Ignition]], including from the [[Feats/Dokkaebi Fire|Dokkaebi Fire]] feat, then you can cast that spell as part of casting _clairvoyance_. Instead of the cantrip's normal effect, you conjure flames in your hand, which persist for the duration of your _clairvoyance_ spell for you to gaze through.
