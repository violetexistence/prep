# Divine Evolution
## Feat 4
### [[divine]][[sorcerer]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** bloodline that grants divine spells
* * *
The divine might provided by your bloodline flows through you. You gain an additional spell slot of your highest level, which you can use only to cast your choice of [[Spells/Heal|Heal]] or [[Spells/Harm|Harm]]. You can cast either of these spells using that spell slot, even if they aren't in your spell repertoire.
