# Felling Shot `pf2:2`
## Feat 12
### [[rogue]]

**Category** class; 




Your ranged attacks can shoot an unprepared foe right out of the air. Make a ranged Strike against an [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] creature. If the Strike is a success and deals damage, the target must attempt a `Reflex check` save against your class DC.

* * *

**Success** The target is unaffected.

**Failure** The target falls up to 120 feet. If it hits the ground, it takes no damage from the fall.

**Critical Failure** As failure, and the target can't fly, jump, levitate, or otherwise leave the ground until the end of your next turn.
