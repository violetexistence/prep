# Guardian Lion Roar `pf2:2`
## Feat 8
### [[auditory]][[inventor]][[sonic]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** armor, construct, or weapon innovation
* * *
Your innovation is augmented with plates shaped to resemble the gaping maws of guardian lions, which you can energize to expel a stream of sonic energy reminiscent of a lion's powerful roar. All creatures in a 20-foot line from your innovation take 2d8 sonic damage with a `Fortitude check` against your class DC. Creatures that fail this save become [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] for 1 round. The damage from this effect increases by 1d8 at 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter.

**Unstable Function** You press concealed switches in the guardian lions' plates, extending their reach and power. Add the unstable trait to Guardian Lion Roar. The range of your roar increases to a 60-foot line. Creatures that succeed (but not critically succeed) at their save also become off-guard for 1 round. On a critical failure when attempting the flat check for this unstable action, you take sonic damage equal to your level instead of fire damage.

* * *

**Special** If your innovation is a minion, it can take this action rather than you.
