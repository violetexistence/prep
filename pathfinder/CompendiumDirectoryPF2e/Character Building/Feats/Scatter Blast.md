# Scatter Blast `pf2:2`
## Feat 6
### [[gunslinger]]

**Category** class; 




**Requirements** You're wielding a loaded firearm that has the scatter trait.

* * *

You pack your weapon with additional shot and powder, creating a risky but devastating wave of destruction. Make a ranged Strike with the firearm. The firearm's range increment increases by 20 feet and the radius of its scatter increases by 20 feet. The Strike gains the following failure conditions.

**Failure** The firearm misfires, but it doesn't cause the other critical failure effects listed below.

**Critical Failure** The firearm misfires and also explodes. It becomes broken, and it deals its normal weapon damage to all creatures in a 20-foot burst centered on the firearm, with a basic Reflex save against your class DC. This damage includes any from the weapon's fundamental and property runes.
