# Shield Wallop `pf2:1`
## Feat 8
### [[flourish]][[guardian]]

**Category** class; 




**Requirements** You are wielding a shield.

* * *

Attacks with your shield knock the sense out of your foes. Make a shield bash, [[Equipment/Shield Boss|Shield Boss]], or [[Equipment/Shield Spikes|Shield Spikes]] Strike. If you hit and deal damage, the target is [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] until the start of your next turn ([[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] on a critical hit). If your shield is a [[Equipment/Tower Shield|Tower Shield]], [[Equipment/Fortress Shield|Fortress Shield]], or another shield that grants a higher circumstance bonus to AC when you [[Actions/Take Cover|Take Cover]] behind it, the creature is instead stupefied 2 if you hit and deal damage to it ([[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 3]] on a critical hit).
