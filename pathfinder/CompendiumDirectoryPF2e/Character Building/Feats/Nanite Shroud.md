# Nanite Shroud `pf2:2`
## Feat 5
### [[android]][[concentrate]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per day

* * *

Your nanites fly out of your body, swarming around you in a cloud.

You become [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] for a number of rounds equal to half your level. You can't use this concealment to [[Actions/Hide|Hide]] or [[Actions/Sneak|Sneak]], as normal for concealment that makes your position obvious.

While Nanite Shroud is active, you can't use other abilities that require the use of your nanites.
