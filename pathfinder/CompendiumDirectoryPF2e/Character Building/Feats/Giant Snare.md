# Giant Snare
## Feat 10
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Snarecrafter Dedication
* * *
You can create bigger snares for quick deployment, making it more likely for a creature to walk into your snares.

When you prepare snares for quick deployment, you can prepare some of them as giant snares. A giant snare takes up a 10-foot-by-10-foot area but costs two of your quick deployment snares. A giant snare can trigger from a creature entering any portion of its area, and all its effects apply over the full area.
