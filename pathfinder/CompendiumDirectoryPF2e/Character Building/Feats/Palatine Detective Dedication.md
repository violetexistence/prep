# Palatine Detective Dedication
## Feat 2
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[archetype]][[class]][[dedication]]

**Category** class; 




You have delved into the study of the occult and divine, becoming exceptionally skilled at identifying when such forces are at work. Using this esoteric knowledge and your own ingenuity, you have crafted a small charm that soothes your mind and protects you against harm. This charm usually takes the form of a silver chain, a golden scarab, or a withered hand. While you wear this charm, you gain a +1 status bonus to saving throws against mental effects. In addition, you gain the [[Actions/Mystic Aegis|Mystic Aegis]] reaction.
