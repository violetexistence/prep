# Elemental Shape
## Feat 10
### [[druid]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Untamed Form

You understand the fundamental elements of nature such that you can imbue them into your body and manifest as a living embodiment of those elements. Add the shapes in [[Spells/Elemental Form|Elemental Form]] to your [[Spells/Untamed Form|Untamed Form]] list. Whenever you're polymorphed into another shape using _untamed form_, you gain resistance 5 to fire.
