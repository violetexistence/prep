# Spellmaster's Tenacity `pf2:r`
## Feat 14
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Spellmaster's Resilience
* * *
**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** You critically fail at a saving throw against a foe's spell, and that spell was cast or created with the tradition of magic you selected with the [[Feats/Spellmaster's Resilience|Spellmaster's Resilience]] feat.

* * *

You call upon the power of your spells to protect you from the worst of the magic headed your way. You fail your saving throw instead of critically failing. For 1 minute, increase the circumstance bonus to saving throws from the Spellmaster's Resilience feat to +2, and increase the resistance to damage it grants to 10.
