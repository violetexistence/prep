# Duck!
## Feat 5
### [[kobold]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Your long experience with your erratic patrons and their peers has given you a lot of practice in hitting the deck when you hear the rumbling of a powerful entity. When you roll a critical failure on a Reflex saving throw against an ability that targets an area and was caused by a Huge or larger creature, you get a failure instead, and when you roll a success against such an effect, you get a critical success instead.
