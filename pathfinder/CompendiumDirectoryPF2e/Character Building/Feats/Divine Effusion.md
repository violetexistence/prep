# Divine Effusion
## Feat 18
### [[oracle]]

**Category** class; 




The power of your mystery surges through you like a font of divine energy, even when your own magic dwindles.

Twice per day, you can cast a spell after you've run out of spell slots of the appropriate spell rank; the two spells you cast with this feat must be of different spell ranks.
