# Legendary Size
## Feat 9
### [[vanara]]

**Category** ancestry; 




The vanaras of old were tricksters able to step across wide rivers or slip into impossibly small spaces. You can cast [[Spells/Enlarge|Enlarge]] and [[Spells/Shrink|Shrink]] once per day each as 2nd-rank divine innate spells. You can target only yourself and other vanaras with these spells.
