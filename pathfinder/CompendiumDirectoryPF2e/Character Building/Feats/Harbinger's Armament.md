# Harbinger's Armament
## Feat 8
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Battle Harbinger Dedication
* * *
Your deity grants you extra power that you have learned to channel into your weapons. Select one weapon or handwraps of mighty blows when you make your daily preparations. While in your hands it gains the effect of one property rune. Choose either [[Equipment/Fearsome|Fearsome]], [[Equipment/Ghost Touch|Ghost Touch]], [[Equipment/Returning|Returning]], [[Equipment/Shifting|Shifting]], or [[Equipment/Vitalizing|Vitalizing]].

This rune does not count toward your maximum rune count, and this choice lasts 24 hours or until you make your next daily preparations, whichever comes first.
