# Shapechanger's Intuition
## Feat 1
### [[kitsune]]

**Category** ancestry; 




A lifetime of experience helps you see through disguises. When you come within 10 feet of a creature that is transformed into another form or is Impersonating a specific creature, the GM rolls a secret Perception check for you to realize that the creature is transformed, even if you didn't spend an action to Seek against that creature.
