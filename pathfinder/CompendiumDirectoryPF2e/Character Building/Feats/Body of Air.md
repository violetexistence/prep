# Body of Air `pf2:r`
## Feat 14
### [[air]][[impulse]][[kineticist]][[overflow]][[polymorph]][[primal]]

**Category** class; 




`pf2:r` or `pf2:2`

**Trigger** An enemy you can observe targets you with an attack or other damaging effect.

* * *

Your gathered air consumes your body, leaving only a cloud of living vapor. This has the same effects on you as [[Spells/Vapor Form|Vapor Form]]. The effect lasts until the end of your next turn, but you can Sustain the form up to 5 minutes. If you activate your kinetic aura, Body of Air ends.

You can use Body of Air as a reaction only when the trigger is met, but you can use it as a 2-action activity without the trigger being met.

* * *

**Level (+1)** The resistance increases by 1.
