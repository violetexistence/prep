# Aerobatics Mastery
## Feat 7
### [[general]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** master in Acrobatics
* * *
You move with grace in flight and can perform amazing aerial stunts.

You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Acrobatics checks to [[Actions/Maneuver in Flight|Maneuver in Flight]] and can combine two maneuvers into a single action, such as reversing direction while making a steep ascent or descent or hovering in gale-force winds. The DC of the Acrobatics check is equal to the DC of the most difficult maneuver + 5.

If you're legendary in Acrobatics, you can combine three such maneuvers into a single action; the DC of the Acrobatics check is equal to the DC of the most difficult maneuver + 10. Regardless of the combination, these maneuvers rarely allow you to move farther than your [[Actions/Fly|Fly]] Speed.
