## Feat 2
### [[archetype]][[class]][[dedication]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** elemental magic
* * *
Each day when you make your daily preparations, you can attune yourself to one element of your choice from your elemental philosophy.

You gain resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1 resistance) against damage dealt by effects with your attuned elemental trait.

This attunement lasts until you next make your daily preparations.
