# Pinning Fire `pf2:r`
## Feat 8
### [[monk]]

**Category** class; 




**Trigger** You use [[Actions/Flurry of Blows|Flurry of Blows]] to make two ranged piercing weapon Strikes against the same target.

* * *

You target your opponent's clothing, equipment, or loose flesh with piercing projectiles to pin them to the ground or a nearby surface.

If both your attacks hit, the target must succeed at a Reflex save against your class DC or become [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] until it or an adjacent creature succeeds at a `DC 10 Athletics check` check to remove the pinning projectiles.

The creature doesn't become stuck if it is incorporeal, is liquid (like a water elemental or some oozes), or could otherwise escape without effort.
