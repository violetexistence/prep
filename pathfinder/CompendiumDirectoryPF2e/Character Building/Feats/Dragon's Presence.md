# Dragon's Presence
## Feat 1
### [[kobold]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** dragonscaled kobold heritage
* * *
As kin to dragonkind, you project unflappable confidence (that collapses catastrophically against the deadliest foes). When you roll a success on a saving throw against a fear effect, you get a critical success instead. When you roll a failure against a fear effect, you get a critical failure instead.

In addition, when you attempt to [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] a foe of your level or lower, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the Intimidation check.
