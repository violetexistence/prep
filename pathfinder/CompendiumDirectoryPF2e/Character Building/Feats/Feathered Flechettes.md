# Feathered Flechettes `pf2:2`
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Winged Warrior Dedication
* * *
Unfurling your wings in a quick snap, you send feathers scattering in all directions. Creatures in a 15-foot emanation take 6d6 slashing damage (`Reflex check` save against your class DC). This increases to 10d6 slashing if your unarmed attacks have a greater striking rune, such as by etching it onto [[Equipment/Handwraps of Mighty Blows|Handwraps of Mighty Blows]], and 16d6 slashing if they have a major striking rune.
