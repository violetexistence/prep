# Tears of Pearl `pf2:2`
## Feat 9
### [[emotion]][[manipulate]][[mental]][[merfolk]][[primal]][[visual]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per day

* * *

You weep, and your tears become gleaming pearls as they fall to the ground, so beautiful others can't help but grab at them. All creatures adjacent to you must attempt a `Will check` save against the higher of your class DC or spell DC. The pearls dissolve at the start of your next turn, turning into salt water.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target is [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] until the start of your next turn as it covets the pearls or reaches for them.

**Failure** The target is slowed 1 until the start of your next turn as it grabs for the pearls, and if it doesn't have a free hand (or similar appendage), it must spend its first action on its next turn to Release one item it's holding.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target is [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 2]] instead of slowed 1.
