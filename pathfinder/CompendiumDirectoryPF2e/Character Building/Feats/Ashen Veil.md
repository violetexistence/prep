# Ashen Veil `pf2:3`
## Feat 7
### [[archetype]][[manipulate]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** Knight Reclaimant Dedication; expert in Religion; master in Stealth
* * *
By smearing ash or tainted earth over your skin and armor, you shroud yourself from the dead. You become [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] to undead using vision or lifesense, allowing you to Hide and [[Actions/Sneak|Sneak]] without other sources of cover or concealment. This effect lasts only as long as you continue to take no actions other than to Hide, Sneak, or other surreptitious actions. The GM determines which actions end the effect, but attacking, casting spells, activating items, and the like always do.
