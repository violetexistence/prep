## Feat 12
### [[fire]][[impulse]][[kineticist]][[manipulate]][[polymorph]][[primal]]

**Category** class; 




Opening your kinetic gate, you allow flames to consume your form and leave you a living flame. You gain the benefits of the [[Spells/Fiery Body|Fiery Body]] spell (except the ability to cast ignition) until the end of your next turn. You can Sustain the impulse up to 1 minute, and when you do, you can Fly up to half your fly Speed. Your fire Elemental Blasts deal an additional die of damage.

**Level (16th)** This duration is 1 minute, you can't Sustain the impulse, and you can Dismiss the impulse.
