# Homing Beacon
## Feat 4
### [[amp]][[psychic]]

**Category** class; 




As your spell strikes a target, you plant a beacon in the target's mind that announces its presence to those nearby. Use this amp in place of a psi cantrip's normal amp entry. The amped cantrip must be one that has one or more targets and must either require a spell attack roll or have a saving throw.

* * *

**Amp** Choose one creature hit by the spell (if the spell has a spell attack roll) or that fails its save against the spell (if the spell requires a save). A psychic beacon emits from the creature's location, making it easier to notice the creature as the mind and attention of onlookers is subtly drawn to it. For 1 minute, if the target would be [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]], it's instead merely [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]], and if it would be concealed, it's no longer concealed.
