# Startling Appearance (Vigilante) `pf2:1`
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]][[emotion]][[fear]][[mental]][[vigilante]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Vigilante Dedication
* * *
**Requirements** You are completely unnoticed by the target creature.

* * *

You can startle foes who are unaware of your presence. Make a Strike against your target. That creature is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] against this Strike, as normal. If your Strike hits, the target remains off-guard for the rest of your turn and is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]] (frightened 2 on a critical hit).
