## Feat 4
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Prophet of Kalistrade Dedication
* * *
You know staying cool is key to prevailing in social situations, as anger leads to mistakes. When a creature you're interacting with decreases its attitude from indifferent to unfriendly or from unfriendly to hostile, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to any attempts to [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] on the creature for the next hour. If this decrease in attitude leads to combat, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the subsequent initiative roll instead.
