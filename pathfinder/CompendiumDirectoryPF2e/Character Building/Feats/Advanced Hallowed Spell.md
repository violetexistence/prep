# Advanced Hallowed Spell
## Feat 8
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Hallowed Necromancer Dedication; necromancer initial school spell or death initial domain spell
* * *
You dig deeper into the magical tools found in wizard schools and divine domains. You gain an advanced focus spell, either the necromancer advanced school spell [[Spells/Life Siphon|Life Siphon]] or the advanced domain spell of the death domain, [[Spells/Eradicate Undeath|Eradicate Undeath]]. Increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1. If you choose _life siphon_, it triggers when you expend spell slots from your class even if they aren't wizard spell slots.

**Special** You can select this feat a second time, choosing the other advanced focus spell.
