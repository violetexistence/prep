# Uncanny Cheeks
## Feat 9
### [[ratfolk]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You gain the [[Feats/Prescient Consumable|Prescient Consumable]] and [[Feats/Prescient Planner|Prescient Planner]] feats, except that you always withdraw the objects from your cheek pouches. This means the object you retrieve must fit in your cheek pouches; this is generally an item of negligible Bulk unless you also have the [[Feats/Cheek Pouches|Cheek Pouches]] feat.
