# Throat Pocket
## Feat 1
### [[nagaji]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You've trained to use unique nagaji eating habits to your advantage. By manipulating your throat muscles, you can create a pocket of air to store up to four items of light Bulk or less without risk of dissolving. None of these items can have a dimension longer than 1 foot.

As long as you have at least one item in your throat pocket, your speech is noticeably difficult to understand, and you have a visible bulge in your neck.

Placing an item in your throat pocket or retrieving one is an Interact action. You can empty your throat pocket with a single action, causing everything you had stored in it to fall to the ground in your square. Any item that was covered in dirt or grime comes out clean.
