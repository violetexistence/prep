# Pact of Infernal Prowess
## Feat 8
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[archetype]][[divine]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Pactbinder Dedication
* * *
You've sworn a pact with devils, granting you success in life in exchange for your soul in the afterlife. Once per hour, when you critically fail a check, you can reroll the check as a free action; this is a fortune effect. Additionally, you can choose to automatically succeed at checks to [[Actions/Earn Income|Earn Income]] for tasks below your level, without rolling. However, when you die, your soul is consigned to Hell. You can't be returned to life except by powerful magic such as [[Spells/Miracle|Miracle]], and even then, the devils responsible for the contract can track your every move for 1 year. The devils gain the effects of a [[Spells/Pinpoint|Pinpoint]] spell. They can also use 10th-rank [[Spells/Scrying|Scrying]] on you at will, and you automatically critically fail your saving throw.

**Special** You can't retrain out of a Pact of Infernal Prowess without journeying to Hell and destroying the devil's written contract spelling out the terms of your pact.
