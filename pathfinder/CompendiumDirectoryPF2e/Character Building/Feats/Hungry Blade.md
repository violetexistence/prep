# Hungry Blade `pf2:1`
## Feat 12
### [[archetype]][[concentrate]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Spectral Dagger
* * *
**Frequency** once per day

**Requirements** Your previous action was a Strike with your spectral dagger that dealt spirit damage.

* * *

Once your spectral dagger has tasted an enemy's soul, your splinter of finality becomes increasingly relentless in its attempts to claim the soul. Your _spectral dagger_ gains the effects of a [[Equipment/Keen|Keen]] property rune that applies only to Strikes against the target of the required Strike. This effect lasts for 10 minutes or until that target dies, whichever comes first.
