# Death Warden
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]][[vitality]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Hallowed Necromancer Dedication
* * *
With your intimate familiarity with the duality of vitality and void energy, you're able to stand as a bulwark against death and undeath alike. You gain resistance to void damage equal to half your level and a +1 status bonus to saving throws against effects with the void trait.
