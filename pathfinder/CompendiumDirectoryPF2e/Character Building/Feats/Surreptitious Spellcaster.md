You've learned that it pays for a Pathfinder to be able to cast spells without being noticed. You gain the [[Feats/Conceal Spell|Conceal Spell]] wizard class feat, though it's not a wizard feat for you. You also gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks to Conceal a Spell and to Deception checks to conceal verbal components.
