# For Love, For Lightning
## Feat 12
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Knight Reclaimant Dedication
* * *
**Access** A character who performs a specialized mission for Clarethe Iomedar has access to this option.

* * *

Rumors suggest this technique was pioneered by knights who undertook missions for Clarethe Iomedar at the half-moon, but many Crimson Reclaimers have since mastered it. You learn the [[Spells/For Love, For Lightning|For Love, For Lightning]] focus spell. If you don't already have one, you gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point, which you can regain using the Refocus activity to recite the Crimson Oath and meditate on its teachings; if you already have a focus pool, increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1. Your knight reclaimant focus spells are divine spells; when you gain this feat, you become trained in divine spell attacks and spell DCs. Charisma is the key spellcasting ability for knight reclaimant focus spells.
