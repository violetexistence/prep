# Irrepressible (Halfling)
## Feat 9
### [[halfling]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You are easily able to ward off attempts to play on your fears and emotions. When you roll a success on a saving throw against an emotion effect, you get a critical success instead. If your heritage is gutsy halfling, when you roll a critical failure on a saving throw against an emotion effect, you get a failure instead.
