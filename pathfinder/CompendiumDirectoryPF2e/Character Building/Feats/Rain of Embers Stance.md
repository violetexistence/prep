## Feat 1
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[fire]][[monk]][[stance]]

**Category** class; 




**Requirements** You are unarmored.

* * *

You enter the stance of an enraged phoenix, holding your fingers as rigid as deadly talons while moving with quick, flickering gestures that flicker with dancing flames. The only Strikes you can make are fire talon Strikes. These deal 1d4 fire damage; are in the brawling group; and have the agile, finesse, fire, nonlethal, and unarmed traits.

While in Rain of Embers Stance, you gain a +1 status bonus to AC and fire resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1).
