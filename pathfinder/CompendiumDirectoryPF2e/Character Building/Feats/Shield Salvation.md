# Shield Salvation
## Feat 10
### [[guardian]]

**Category** class; 




You can save your shield from total destruction, even after a devastating attack. If your shield would be destroyed due to damage taken during your [[Feats/Shield Block|Shield Block]], the shield remains intact at 1 Hit Point instead.

Its construction is weakened until you take the time to repair it thoroughly, preventing you from using Shield Salvation to save the same shield until your next daily preparations.
