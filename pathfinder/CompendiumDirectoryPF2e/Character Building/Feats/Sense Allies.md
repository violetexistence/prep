# Sense Allies
## Feat 5
### [[human]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Like many humans raised in a close-knit community, you have always been strongly attuned to the presence of others. Willing allies that you are aware of within 60 feet that would otherwise be [[Conditions/Undetected|Undetected]] by you are instead [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] from you. The flat check for you to target willing allies within 60 feet that are hidden from you is `DC 5 Flat check` instead of 11.
