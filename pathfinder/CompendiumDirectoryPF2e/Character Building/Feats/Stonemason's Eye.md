# Stonemason's Eye
## Feat 1
### [[dwarf]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You understand the intricacies of stonework. You become trained in Crafting. If you're already trained in Crafting, you instead gain the [[Feats/Specialty Crafting|Specialty Crafting]] skill feat for stonemasonry.

You also gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to notice unusual stonework. This bonus applies to checks to discover mechanical traps made of stone or [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] within stone.

If you aren't using the [[Actions/Seek|Seek]] action or searching, the GM automatically rolls a secret check for you to notice unusual stonework anyway. This check doesn't gain your normal circumstance bonus.
