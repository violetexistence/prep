# Boneyard Acquaintance
## Feat 17
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[force]][[reincarnated]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Before your soul returned to the Material Plane, you interacted with a host of other souls on their way to the Boneyard. One of these acquaintances owes you a favor. You can temporarily summon it to come to your aid, and it appears as a swirling mass of ectoplasm with indiscernible features and a translucent [[Equipment/Dagger|Dagger]], the favored weapon of Pharasma. This functions as [[Spells/Spiritual Guardian|Spiritual Guardian]], which you can cast once per day as a divine innate spell, but you don't need to worship a deity to do so.
