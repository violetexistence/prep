# Searing Restoration `pf2:1`
## Feat 2
### [[fire]][[healing]][[inventor]][[manipulate]][[unstable]]

**Category** class; 




They told you there was no way that explosions could heal people, but they were foolsâ€¦ Fools who didn't understand your brilliance! You create a minor explosion from your innovation, altering the combustion to cauterize wounds using vaporized medicinal herbs. You or a living creature adjacent to you regains 1d10 healing Hit Points. In addition, the creature you heal can attempt an immediate flat check to recover from a single source of persistent bleed damage, with the DC reduction from appropriate assistance.

At 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, increase the healing by 1d10.

**Special** If your innovation is a minion, it can take this action rather than you, though because it's not a living creature, it can't use the ability on itself.
