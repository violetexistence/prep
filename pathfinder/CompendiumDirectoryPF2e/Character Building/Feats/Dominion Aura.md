# Dominion Aura `pf2:2`
## Feat 17
### [[aura]][[divine]][[force]][[nephilim]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Faultspawn
* * *
**Frequency** once per day

For a short time, you fully manifest the expectations of the god destroyer within you. All creatures within a 10-foot emanation take 8d6 force damage with a `Fortitude check` save. A creature that fails this save is also knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]. For 1 minute, any creature who ends its turn within the 10-foot emanation takes 5d6 force damage with a basic Fortitude save. If you aren't drained, you can choose to become [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 2]] when you use Dominion Aura to increase the radius of the emanation from 10 feet to 20 feet.
