# Unified Theory
## Feat 15
### [[general]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** legendary in Arcana
* * *
You understand the common underpinnings of the four traditions of magic and magical essences, allowing you to understand them all through an arcane lens. Whenever you use a skill action or a skill feat that requires a Nature, Occultism, or Religion check, depending on the magic tradition, you can use Arcana instead. If you would normally take a penalty or have a higher DC for using Arcana on other magic (such as when using Identify Magic), you no longer do so.
