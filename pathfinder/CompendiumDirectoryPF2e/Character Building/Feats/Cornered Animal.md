# Cornered Animal `pf2:2`
## Feat 8
### [[archetype]][[flourish]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Werecreature Dedication
* * *
**Requirements** You are in animal or hybrid form and are flanked.

* * *

You become more dangerous when surrounded by enemies. You make unarmed Strikes against two different creatures flanking you. The attacks take a â€“2 penalty if the unarmed weapon is not agile. Both attacks count toward your multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after you've made both of them.
