# Dread Marshal Stance `pf2:1`
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]][[stance]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Marshal Dedication; trained in Intimidation
* * *
Putting on a grim face for the battle ahead, you encourage your allies to strike fear into their foes with vicious attacks. When you use this action, attempt an `Intimidation check` check. The DC is usually an easy DC of your level, but the GM can assign a different DC based on the circumstances. The effect depends on the result of your check.

* * *

**Success** Your marshal's aura grants you and your allies in the aura a +1 status bonus to damage rolls. When you or an ally in the aura critically hit an enemy with a Strike, that enemy is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]]. If you're wielding a weapon that has more than one damage die (typically due to a striking rune), you can have the status bonus equal the weapon's number of damage dice instead of +1.

**Failure** You fail to enter the stance.

**Critical Failure** You fail to enter the stance and can't take this action again for 1 minute.
