# Fleeing Shriek `pf2:2`
## Feat 9
### [[auditory]][[kobold]][[sonic]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

You let out an ear-piercing screech. Each creature in a 10-foot emanation takes 1d6 sonic damage, with a `Fortitude check` saving throw against the higher of your class DC or spell DC. You then Stride, and this movement doesn't trigger reactions from any creature that failed or critically failed its saving throw.

At 11th level and every 2 levels thereafter, the damage increases by 1d6.
