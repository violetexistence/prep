# Megavolt `pf2:2`
## Feat 6
### [[electricity]][[inventor]][[manipulate]]

**Category** class; 




You bleed off some electric power from your innovation in the shape of a damaging bolt. Creatures in a 20-foot line from your innovation take 3d4 electricity damage, with a `Reflex check` against your class DC. The electricity damage increases by 1d4 at 8th level and every 2 levels thereafter.

**Unstable Function** You overload and supercharge the voltage even higher. Add the unstable trait to Megavolt. The area increases to a 60-foot line and the damage increases from d4s to d12s. If you have the breakthrough innovation class feature, you can choose a 60-foot or 90-foot line for the area when you use an unstable Megavolt; if you also have the revolutionary innovation class feature, you can choose a 60-foot, 90-foot, or 120-foot line.

**Special** If your innovation is a minion, it can take this action rather than you.
