# Spiritual Expansion Spell `pf2:1`
## Feat 2
### [[animist]][[apparition]][[concentrate]][[spellshape]]

**Category** class; 




Your apparitions manifest to scatter the energy of your spell. If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell that has an area of a burst, cone, or line and does not have a duration, increase the area of that spell. Add 5 feet to the radius of a burst that normally has a radius of at least 10 feet (a burst with a smaller radius is not affected). Add 5 feet to the length of a cone or line that is normally 15 feet long or smaller, and add 10 feet to the length of a larger cone or line.

You can also use this feat to increase the radius of an emanation spell with a duration by 5 feet by dedicating your primary apparition to maintaining the spellshape; dedicating the apparition to the spell prevents you from using the apparition's vessel spell, apparition skills, or [[Spells/Avatar|Avatar]] form for the duration of the modified spell.
