# Noble Sacrifice `pf2:r`
## Feat 16
### [[mythic]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Prophesied Monarch Dedication
* * *
**Trigger** One of your designated knights is within 15 feet of you and would take damage from an enemy's Strike.

* * *

As your knights devote their lives and swords to you, so too do you return their devotion with your own fierce protection. Spend a Mythic Point. The knight Steps as a free action, and you Stride into the space previously occupied by the knight; this movement ignores difficult terrain and greater difficult terrain. You then take the triggering damage instead. If you have a shield raised and have the Shield Block reaction, you can use it as part of this ability, applying damage to the shield as though you were the original target of the attack. The enemy whose Strike triggered this reaction is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the end of your next turn.
