## Feat 9
### [[incapacitation]][[mental]][[vishkanya]][[visual]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Performance
* * *
**Frequency** once per day

* * *

You command the attention of those around you with an elegant display. Attempt a `Performance check` check and compare it to the Will DC of each creature in a 15-foot emanation.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is [[Conditions/Fascinated|Fascinated]] with you for as long as you perform (unless it breaks from the fascination, as normal for the condition) and is [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] for 1 round or as long as it's fascinated, whichever is longer.

**Success** The target is fascinated for 1 round and is dazzled for 1 round.

**Failure** The target is dazzled for 1 round.

**Critical Failure** The target is unaffected.
