# Bleed Out `pf2:1`
## Feat 2
### [[attack]][[sorcerer]]

**Category** class; 




**Requirements** Your most recent action was to cast a non-cantrip spell that granted you a blood magic effect.

* * *

You channel the residual energy from the last spell you cast into a ranged bloodletting. Make a ranged spell attack roll against the AC of a target within 60 feet. This attack deals persistent bleed damage equal to the rank of the spell you just cast.
