# Megafauna Veterinarian
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** Mammoth Lord Dedication; Expert in Nature
* * *
By heeding the wise advice of elders in your following- and aided by your own experience-you've learned how to provide medical care to the megafauna of the Mammoth Lord followings. You can attempt a Nature check instead of a Medicine check for any of Medicine's trained and untrained uses, provided the subject of your medical care is a megafauna. If you're attempting an action that requires a particular proficiency rank in Medicine (such as [[Actions/Treat Wounds|Treat Wounds]]), use your proficiency rank in Nature instead. If the subject of your care is your megafauna and you roll a success on your check, you get a critical success instead.
