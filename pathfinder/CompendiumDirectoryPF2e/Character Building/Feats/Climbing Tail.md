# Climbing Tail
## Feat 1
### [[vanara]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Your tail makes it much easier for you to climb. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks to Climb, you gain the [[Feats/Combat Climber|Combat Climber]] skill feat, and you reduce the number of free hands required to Climb or [[Actions/Trip|Trip]] by one.
