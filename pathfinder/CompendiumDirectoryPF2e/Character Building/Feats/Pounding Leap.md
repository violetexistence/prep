## Feat 5
### [[jotunborn]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** warrior jotunborn heritage
* * *
You use the momentum of your massive fists to launch yourself through the air. Strike with your fist unarmed attack and then attempt a [[Actions/High Jump|High Jump]] or [[Actions/Long Jump|Long Jump]]; you count as having a running start and do not need to Stride before this activity to avoid failure. You can attempt this Strike against an unattended object or unoccupied flat surface, and you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Athletics check to High Jump or Long Jump when you do so.

_PFS Note:_ For the purposes of this feat, the AC of an unoccupied surface is 10.
