# Esoteric Warden
## Feat 2
### [[thaumaturge]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Exploit Vulnerability
* * *
When you apply antithetical material against a creature successfully, you also ward yourself against its next attacks. When you succeed at your check to Exploit a Vulnerability, you gain a +1 status bonus to your AC against the creature's next attack and a +1 status bonus to your next saving throw against the creature; if you critically succeed, these bonuses are +2 instead. You can gain these bonuses only once per day against a particular creature, and the benefit ends if you Exploit Vulnerability again.
