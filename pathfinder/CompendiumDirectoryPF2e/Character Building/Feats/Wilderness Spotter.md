# Wilderness Spotter
## Feat 2
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[general]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** expert in Survival
* * *
Select one type of terrain from the following list: aquatic, arctic, desert, forest, mountain, plains, sky, swamp, or underground. You can use Survival in place of Perception to roll initiative when in the selected terrain in a natural location (not a structure) even if you weren't tracking or otherwise using Survival before the encounter. You can also use Survival instead of Perception to notice traps in natural locations in the chosen terrain; if you find a snare in this way, you can also use Survival instead of Thievery to Disable the Device.

* * *

**Special** You can select this feat more than once. Each time you select it, the feat applies to a new type of terrain.
