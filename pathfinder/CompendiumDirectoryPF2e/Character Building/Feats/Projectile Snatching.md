# Projectile Snatching
## Feat 8
### [[monk]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Deflect Projectile
* * *
You pluck missiles from the air and hurl them back at their source. When you successfully deflect an attack with Deflect Projectile, as part of that same reaction, you can then immediately make a ranged Strike against the attacker using the projectile you deflected. This is a thrown weapon with the same range increment and effect on a hit as the triggering attack.
