# Tree of Duality `pf2:3`
## Feat 6
### [[air]][[composite]][[impulse]][[kineticist]][[primal]][[wood]]

**Category** class; 




An ephemeral tree bursts forth, floating on air in an unoccupied square of your choice within 60 feet. Blooming flowers and fungal growths shed pollen and spores, which a swirling gust of air spreads in a 10-foot emanation around it. The tree lasts until the end of your next turn, and you can Sustain it up to 1 minute. This has both of the following effects.

*   **Cleansing Pollen** (healing, vitality) Each living ally that's in the area or enters it regains 3d4 healing HP and is then temporarily immune to regaining HP from Tree of Duality for 10 minutes.
*   **Hallucinogenic Spores** (mental) Enemies in the area are [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]]. An enemy that leaves the area remains dazzled until the start of its next turn.

* * *

**Level (+2)** The healing increases by 1d4.
