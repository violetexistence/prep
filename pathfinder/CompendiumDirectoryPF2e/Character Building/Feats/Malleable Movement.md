# Malleable Movement `pf2:0`
## Feat 2
### [[archetype]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** Mind Smith Dedication; expert in Athletics
* * *
**Trigger** You Leap.

* * *

You shift the shape of your weapon to help you Leap farther and faster. You shift your weapon into a long flexible pole, climbing hook, or similar aid, adding an extra 5 feet to the distance you're able to Leap. As normal, this can't increase the distance of your Leap beyond your Speed.
