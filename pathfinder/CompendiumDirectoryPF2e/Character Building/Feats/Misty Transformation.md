# Misty Transformation `pf2:r`
## Feat 6
### [[druid]][[primal]]

**Category** class; 




**Frequency** once per minute

**Trigger** You transform due to a polymorph effect. Wild mists cover your form.

* * *

You create a hazy cloud in a 5-foot burst centered on one corner of your space. If your new form is Large or larger, the cloud covers your entire space instead. All creatures within the area are [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]], and all others are concealed to them. The cloud lasts until the beginning of your next turn but is immediately dispersed by a strong wind.
