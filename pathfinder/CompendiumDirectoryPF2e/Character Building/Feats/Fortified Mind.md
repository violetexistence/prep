# Fortified Mind
## Feat 9
### [[kashrishi]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Your mind is unusually resilient and resistant to influence. When you would gain the [[Conditions/Fascinated|Fascinated]] or stupefied condition, you can attempt a `DC 17 Flat check`. On a success, you don't gain the fascinated or stupefied condition.
