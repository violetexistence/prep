# Divert Destiny `pf2:0`
## Feat 6
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[mythic]]

**Category** class; 




**Trigger** An attack or effect would reduce you to 0 Hit Points or kill you outright.

* * *

You defy the fate before you, calling on wells of mythic vitality to sustain your life and allow you to persevere. You expend 1 Mythic Point and survive the triggering attack or effect, lose the wounded or dying conditions entirely, don't increase your doomed condition, and are conscious and standing with a number of Hit Points equal to 10 + your level, regardless of how many Hit Points you had before.
