# Too Angry to Die `pf2:r`
## Feat 12
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[general]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** master in Intimidation
* * *
**Trigger** you stand up from [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] after waking up from being [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]]

* * *

You refuse to yield the battle, even after you've been knocked off your feet and nearly killed. For you, such a brush with death is less something to fear and more a thing to become infuriated by. As you stand up, you roar in defiance and can attempt to [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] a foe.
