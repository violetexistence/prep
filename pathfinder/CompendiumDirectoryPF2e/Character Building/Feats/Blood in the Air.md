# Blood in the Air `pf2:1`
## Feat 12
### [[concentrate]][[gunslinger]]

**Category** class; 




**Requirements** An enemy you've damaged with a ranged weapon during the last minute is [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] or [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] from you.

* * *

Once you've locked on to a target, little can obscure your aim. Make a ranged weapon Strike against the required target. This Strike ignores the target's concealed condition and reduces the flat check for the hidden condition from 11 to 5.
