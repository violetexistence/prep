# Elegant Buckler
## Feat 1
### [[swashbuckler]]

**Category** class; 




You've learned a flexible way to position your [[Equipment/Buckler|Buckler]] to provide more protection. When you [[Actions/Raise a Shield|Raise a Shield]] to gain a circumstance bonus to AC from a buckler, increase the bonus from +1 to +2.

While you have a buckler raised, if a creature critically misses you with a Strike, you gain panache until the end of your next turn.
