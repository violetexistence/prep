# Guiding Shot `pf2:1`
## Feat 2
### [[commander]][[flourish]]

**Category** class; 




**Requirements** You are wielding a ranged weapon.

* * *

Your ranged attack helps guide your allies into striking your enemy's weak point. Attempt a Strike with the required weapon. If the Strike hits, the next creature other than you to attack the same target before the start of your next turn gains a +1 circumstance bonus to their roll, or a +2 circumstance bonus if your Strike was a critical hit.
