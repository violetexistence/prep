# Sabotage
## Feat 4
### [[incapacitation]][[rogue]]

**Category** class; 




**Requirements** You have a free hand.

* * *

You subtly damage others' equipment. Choose one item that a creature within your reach wields or carries. The item must have moving parts that you could possibly sabotage (a shortbow could be sabotaged, but a longsword could not). Attempt a `Thievery check` check against the Reflex DC of the creature. Damage dealt by Sabotage can't take the item below its Broken Threshold.

* * *

**Critical Success** You deal damage equal to 4 x your Thievery proficiency bonus.

**Success** You deal damage equal to double your Thievery proficiency bonus.

**Critical Failure** The item is temporarily immune to your Sabotage for 1 day.
