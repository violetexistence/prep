# Pistolero's Challenge `pf2:1`
## Feat 6
### [[auditory]][[flourish]][[gunslinger]][[linguistic]][[mental]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Way of the Pistolero
* * *
With a stern call, carefully chosen barb, or some other challenging declaration, you demand your foe's attention in a duel. Choose an opponent within 30 feet who you can perceive and can hear you, and make your choice of a `Deception check` or `Intimidation check` check against the target's Will DC. No matter the result of the check, the foe is temporarily immune to your Pistolero's Challenge until noon the next day.

**Success** Both you and the opponent gain a +2 status bonus to damage rolls with Strikes made against each other. If you're a master in the skill you used for the check, the status bonus to damage rolls increases to +3, and if you're legendary, it increases to +4.

[[Feat_Feature Effects/Effect_ Pistolero's Challenge|Effect: Pistolero's Challenge]]

You can have only one challenge in effect at a time; challenging a new opponent ends this effect on any current target. Otherwise, the effect lasts until one of you is defeated, flees, or the encounter ends.

**Critical Failure** You become [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]] and can't use this ability again for 1 minute.
