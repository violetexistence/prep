# Dig Quickly `pf2:2`
## Feat 1
### [[manipulate]][[shoony]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Requirements** You are standing on dirt, sand, snow, or similar particulate material.

Your hands work as effectively as shovels when you need to dig a quick hole. You dig a shallow pit in the square you currently occupy, turning the square into difficult terrain (including for you). In addition, you also kick up a cloud of grit in a direction of your choice. The cloud extinguishes small, unattended, non-magical fires and helps smother the flames on burning creatures located within the cone; creatures in this cone that are taking [[Conditions/Persistent Damage|Persistent Fire Damage]] can immediately attempt an additional flat DC 15 check to end the persistent damage.
