# Release Spores `pf2:2`
## Feat 2
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[deviant]][[fungus]][[magical]][[poison]]

**Category** class; 




You create a miasma of spores. These spores fill a 20-foot burst within 100 feet and remain for 1 round per level you have. All creatures within the spores become [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]], and all creatures outside the spores become concealed to creatures within it. You can see through the spores without difficulty. You can Dismiss the spores.

**Awakening** The spores smell disgusting. Creatures in the area are [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] for as long as they remain in the area, plus 2 rounds.

**Awakening** The spores are toxic. The miasma deals 0 poison damage per 2 levels you have to creatures in the area when you Release Spores, to creatures who begin their turn in the area, and to creatures who enter the area.
