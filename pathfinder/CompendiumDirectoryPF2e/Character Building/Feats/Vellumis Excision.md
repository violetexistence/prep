## Feat 16
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Halcyon Spellcasting Adept
* * *
**Access** You're a member of the Vellumis Scholars.

You seek to excise the rot from the Gravelands and have made progress to do so. You can cast [[Spells/Field of Life|Field of Life]] as a 6th-rank halcyon spell, and you gain a 6th-rank halcyon spell slot. When you cast your halcyon _field of life_ as a primal spell, any living creatures in the area when you Sustain the spell gain a +2 status bonus to saving throws against curses, diseases, and poisons for 1 round.

**Special** If you have the Halcyon Spellcasting Sage feat, you treat the _field of life_ halcyon spell gained from this feat as a signature spell, even though halcyon spells normally can't be signature spells.
