# Flash of Omnipotence `pf2:0`
## Feat 20
### [[archetype]][[divine]][[mythic]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Mortal Herald Dedication
* * *
**Trigger** Your turn begins.

* * *

For but a moment you hold the power of a god. You spend a Mythic Point. Until the end of your turn, any damage you deal ignores all the target's resistance and immunities or triggers the target's highest weakness if they have no resistance or immunities.
