* * *

The blood of heroes courses through your veins, and you inspire your allies to dig deep and find a new level of resolve. You grant up to 10 willing creatures within 30 feet the effects of a 6th-rank [[Spells/Zealous Conviction|Zealous Conviction]], though the effect automatically ends on a target if you give that target a command they would normally find repugnant. This action has the auditory trait or visual trait, depending on how you inspire your allies.
