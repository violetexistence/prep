# Sever the Dreaming Shadow
## Feat 17
### [[wayang]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Inherit the Dreaming Heirloom
* * *
As you whisper to your pusaka, it attempts to cut away an enemy's shadow, leaving them in an eternal sleep. Your pusaka gains the following Activation.

**Activateâ€”Cut the Shadow** `pf2:2` (concentrate, manipulate, mental)

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** Your pusaka becomes a kris made of darkness and drives itself into an adjacent enemy's shadow. That enemy takes 80 mental damage with a `Fortitude check` save against your spell DC or class DC, whichever is higher. If this reduces the creature to 0 Hit Points, the target doesn't die, but its shadow is severed from its body, becoming a [[Monster Core/Shadow Spawn|Shadow Spawn]] that attempts to flee from the target's body. As long as the shadow spawn exists, the target remains in a dreamless slumber; if destroyed, the target regains its shadow and awakens (if its body was kept properly while [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]]).
