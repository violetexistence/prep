Your skill in combining fist and blade has grown into a seamless art where each attack makes an opponent more vulnerable to the next.

You gain the following benefits.

*   When you successfully Strike an opponent with this weapon, it's [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] to the next Strike you make against it with a fist unarmed attack before the end of your next turn.
