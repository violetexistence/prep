# Greenwatcher
## Feat 10
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[gunslinger]][[investigator]][[ranger]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Defy Fey
* * *
Your experience fighting against and alongside fey creatures is nearly unrivaled. Any weapon you wield or unarmed attack you make against a fey creature is treated as cold iron. Whenever you critically fail a save against a spell cast by a fey creature, it's instead treated as a normal failure. Whenever you critically succeed on a Strike against a fey creature, the target is immediately subject to the effects of a [[Spells/Faerie Fire|Faerie Fire]] spell. For the purposes of counteracting this effect, it's an innate 2nd-rank primal spell.
