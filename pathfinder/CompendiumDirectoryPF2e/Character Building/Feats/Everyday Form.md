# Everyday Form
## Feat 1
### [[tanuki]]

**Category** ancestry; 




There's nothing better than being a tanuki, but sometimes you need a less conspicuous form when going into the big city or other crowded places. When you Change Shape, you can assume the form of a common Small or Medium humanoid ancestry prevalent where you grew up, typically human. This everyday form is a specific form with the same age and body type as your true tanuki form and has roughly analogous physical traits, such as hair color.
