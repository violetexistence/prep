# Cover Fire `pf2:1`
## Feat 1
### [[gunslinger]]

**Category** class; 




**Frequency** once per round

**Requirements** You're wielding a loaded firearm or crossbow.

* * *

You lay down suppressive fire to protect allies by forcing foes to take cover from your wild attacks. Make a firearm or crossbow Strike; the target must decide before you roll your attack whether it will duck out of the way. If the target ducks, it gains a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against your attack, or a +4 circumstance bonus to AC if it has cover. It also takes a -2 circumstance penalty to ranged attack rolls until the end of its next turn. If the target chooses not to duck, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your attack roll for that Strike.
