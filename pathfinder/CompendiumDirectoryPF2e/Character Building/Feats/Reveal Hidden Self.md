# Reveal Hidden Self `pf2:3`
## Feat 5
### [[concentrate]][[divine]][[illusion]][[nephilim]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Beastbrood
* * *
**Frequency** once per day

**Requirements** You're [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] to at least one enemy.

While hidden, you manifest a version of your animalistic nature. You create an illusion of a Large or smaller creature within 60 feet of your location with the effects of the [[Spells/Illusory Creature|Illusory Creature]] spell. The creature shares your animalistic beastbrood features. Unlike most actions taken while hidden, using Reveal Hidden Self and Sustaining the Spell don't automatically end your hidden condition. Use the higher of your class DC or spell DC against attempts to disbelieve the illusion. If a creature observes you, it automatically disbelieves the illusion, and if you're no longer hidden to at least one enemy, the effect ends.
