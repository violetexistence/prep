# Thrown Voice
## Feat 5
### [[strix]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You've learned how to throw your voice through the winds, tricking others as to your location. You can cast [[Spells/Ventriloquism|Ventriloquism]] as a primal innate spell once per day. If you're a songbird strix, you can cast it twice per day instead.
