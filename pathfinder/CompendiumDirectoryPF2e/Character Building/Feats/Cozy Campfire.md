# Cozy Campfire
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]][[consecration]][[divine]][[exploration]][[fire]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Campfire Chronicler Dedication
* * *
You spend 1 hour building a campfire in a single unoccupied square and whispering the stories of those you've met on your journeys. The campfire sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius (and dim light for the next 30 feet). The campfire can't be put out or get larger through mundane means; it instead burns out after your next daily preparations or when you use this ability again.

The first time each round a creature within the campfire's bright light performs an action with the attack trait, they must then attempt a `Will check` save against your class DC or spell DC (whichever is higher). This is a divine curse effect, and you are aware of any attempt, although other creatures in the area are not.
