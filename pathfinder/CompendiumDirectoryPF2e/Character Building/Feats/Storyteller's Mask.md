# Storyteller's Mask
## Feat 20
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[archetype]][[druid]][[wizard]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Druid Dedication or Wizard Dedication
* * *
Your mask remembers the stories of Shifting Frog, Storyteller of the Past and Future. You can cast [[Spells/Foresight|Foresight]] once per day as an innate spell, either arcane if you have Wizard Dedication or primal if you have Druid Dedication, but the duration is 10 minutes instead of 1 hour. Immediately after you Cast a non-cantrip Spell that targets only a single foe, you can [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] about that foe.
