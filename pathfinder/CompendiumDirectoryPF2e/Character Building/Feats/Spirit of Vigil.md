# Spirit of Vigil
## Feat 18
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** No Stranger to Death
* * *
Though the city of Vigil itself has been destroyed, you will carry on its warrior spirit to the end of your days. The value of your dying condition at which you die increases by 1 (normally to dying 5, or dying 6 if you have Diehard), and the reduction to your maximum dying value from the doomed condition is 1 less severe (to a minimum of 0).
