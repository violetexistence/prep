# Belly Flop `pf2:1`
## Feat 10
### [[guardian]]

**Category** class; 




**Requirements** You are wearing medium or heavy armor and are standing adjacent to a [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] enemy.

* * *

You crush an enemy under the enormous weight of your armor. You drop prone and make a fist Strike against the prone enemy. You don't take the penalty from being prone to this Strike's attack roll, nor do you need to have a free hand to make it. If you're wielding a [[Equipment/Gauntlet|Gauntlet]] or [[Equipment/Spiked Gauntlet|Spiked Gauntlet]], you can Strike with one of those weapons instead of your fist. If you hit, you [[Conditions/Immobilized|immobilize]] the target, and you can add your armor's item bonus to your Athletics for the [[Actions/Escape|Escape]] DC. The immobilization ends automatically if you Stand or otherwise move from the spot where you dropped prone.
