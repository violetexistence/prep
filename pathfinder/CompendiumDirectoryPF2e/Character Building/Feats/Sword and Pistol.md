# Sword and Pistol
## Feat 1
### [[gunslinger]]

**Category** class; 




You're comfortable wielding a firearm or crossbow in one hand and a melee weapon in the other, combining melee attacks with shots from the firearm. When you make a successful ranged Strike against an enemy within your reach with your one-handed firearm or one-handed crossbow, that enemy is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] against your next melee attack with a one-handed melee weapon.

When you make a successful melee Strike against an enemy with your one-handed melee weapon, the next ranged Strike you make against that enemy with a one-handed firearm or one-handed crossbow doesn't trigger reactions that would trigger on a ranged attack but not a melee attack, such as Reactive Strike. Either of these benefits is lost if not used by the end of your next turn.
