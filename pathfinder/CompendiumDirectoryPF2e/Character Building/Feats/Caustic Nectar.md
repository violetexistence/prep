You have specialized glands inside your throat, which produce acidic nectar that you can spit long distances. You gain a nectar ranged unarmed attack with a range increment of 20 feet that deals 1d4 acid damage. On a critical hit, the target is additionally [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]]. Your nectar doesn't add critical specialization effects. You're immune to your own nectar.
