You can deliver a melee blow to a demon that creates an explosion of holy light to try to finish the demon off. In addition to the normal damage from your melee Strike, you also inflict 10d6 spirit damage to the demon. The demon can resist this additional damage with a `Fortitude check` save against your class DC. If the demon is slain by this strike, it explodes in a blast of holy light that fills a 30-foot emanation. All creatures in this area that have the demon trait take 10d6 spirit damage and must attempt a `Fortitude check` save against your class DC.
