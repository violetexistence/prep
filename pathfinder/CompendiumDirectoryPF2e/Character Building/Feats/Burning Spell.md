# Burning Spell `pf2:1`
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]][[fire]][[spellshape]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Elementalist Dedication; fire is in your elemental philosophy
* * *
You enhance your spell with elemental fire, causing it to set the target on fire. If the next action you use is to Cast a non-cantrip Spell that deals damage at a single target, the spell deals additional [[Conditions/Persistent Damage|Persistent Fire Damage]] equal to the spell rank, in addition to its other effects. This has no effect if the spell already deals persistent fire damage. The spell gains the fire trait.
