# Snagging Strike `pf2:1`
## Feat 1
### [[fighter]]

**Category** class; 




**Requirements** You have one hand free, and your target is within reach of that hand.

* * *

You combine an attack with quick grappling moves to throw an enemy off balance as long as it stays in your reach. Make a Strike while keeping one hand free. If this Strike hits, the target is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the start of your next turn or until it's no longer within the reach of your hand, whichever comes first.
