Your mask holds the legacy of Black Heron, the Wings of Knowledge, who united the aeromancers of the Shory Empire. You can harness residual magical power to fly. You gain a fly Speed equal to your Speed. Immediately after you Cast a non-cantrip Spell that targets only you, your fly Speed doubles until your next turn.
