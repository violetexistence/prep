# Warding Light
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Bright Lion Dedication
* * *
You gain a tattoo that serves as a special ward to defend you against Walkena's forces.

The tattoo allows you to cast the [[Spells/Light|Light]] cantrip as a divine innate spell at will. The cantrip is heightened to a spell rank equal to half your level rounded up. If you die, the tattoo immediately casts [[Spells/Peaceful Rest|Peaceful Rest]] on your corpse, heightened to the same spell rank.
