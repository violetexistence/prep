# Preventative Treatment
## Feat 8
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[archetype]][[secret]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Medic Dedication; Treat Condition
* * *
You provide preventative remedies and care to help your patient fight off future maladies. You Treat a Condition the target doesn't yet have, naming any condition you could normally treat with Treat Condition. The counteract check gains the secret trait, so the GM rolls it secretly. The next time within the next minute the creature would be affected by that condition, your treatment immediately attempts to reduce the condition value with the effects of Treat Condition, using the secret roll result for the check. Preventative Treatment lasts on a creature for 1 minute, until the treatment is used, or until you use Preventative Treatment again on that creature, whichever comes first.
