You and those closest to you are protected by your deity's power. For 1 minute, you and all allies within 10 feet of you gain a +1 item bonus to AC and resistance 10 to spirit damage. In addition, when a creature adjacent to you hits you with a melee attack, or when a creature touches you or hits you with an unarmed attack, that creature takes 5 spirit damage.

At 20th level, the spirit resistance increases to 15 and the spirit damage increases to 10.
