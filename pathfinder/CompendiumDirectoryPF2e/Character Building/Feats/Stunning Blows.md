# Stunning Blows
## Feat 2
### [[monk]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Flurry of Blows
* * *
The focused power of your flurry threatens to overwhelm your opponent. When you target the same creature with two Strikes from your [[Actions/Flurry of Blows|Flurry of Blows]], you can try to stun the creature. If either Strike hits and deals damage, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC or be [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]] (or [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 3]] on a critical failure). This is an incapacitation effect.
