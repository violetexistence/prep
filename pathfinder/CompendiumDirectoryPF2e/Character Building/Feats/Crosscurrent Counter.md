# Crosscurrent Counter `pf2:r`
## Feat 8
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[magus]][[water]]

**Category** class; 




**Trigger** You become [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]] by a creature.

* * *

You counter the creature with the power of elemental water, a tendril of it encasing your limb or weapon. You attempt an Athletics check to [[Actions/Grapple|Grapple]] the triggering creature, even if it's outside your reach or you don't have a free hand. If you succeed, you also remove the triggering condition, and the tendril of water pulls the creature adjacent to you before dissipating.
