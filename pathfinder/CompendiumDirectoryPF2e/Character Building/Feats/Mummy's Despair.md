# Mummy's Despair `pf2:2`
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]][[aura]][[divine]][[emotion]][[fear]][[mental]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Mummy Dedication
* * *
**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

You force your mental anguish outward, projecting it upon those around you. You gain an aura of despair in a 30-foot emanation lasting 5 rounds. A creature that enters or begins its turn in the aura must succeed at a `Will check` save against the higher of your class DC or spell DC or be [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]] ([[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] on a critical failure). A creature that succeeds at the save is temporarily immune to Mummy's Despair for 10 minutes.
