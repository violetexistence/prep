# Benefactor's Majesty `pf2:1`
## Feat 17
### [[healing]][[kobold]][[visual]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per day

You tap into the grandeur of your warren's benefactor. You gain temporary Hit Points equal to your level, which last for 1 minute. In addition, you can immediately attempt a flat check to remove each type of persistent damage you have. Finally, until the start of your next turn, any creature targeting you with a harmful attack, spell, or ability much first succeed at a `DC 11 Flat check` or the action is disrupted as the creature avoids setting eyes upon your majesty.
