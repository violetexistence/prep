# Tributary Circulation `pf2:1`
## Feat 4
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[concentrate]][[monk]][[occult]][[water]]

**Category** class; 




Never distant from water's succoring presence, your refined breathing techniques focus your awareness and control of water inward. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Will saves and saves against poison until the beginning of your next turn. If you spent two actions on Tributary Circulation, you can also attempt a flat check to end persistent poison damage you're suffering, reducing the DC to 10 as if you had gained the benefits of assisted recovery.
