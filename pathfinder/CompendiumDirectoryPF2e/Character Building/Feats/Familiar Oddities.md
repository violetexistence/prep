### [[archetype]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** Curse Maelstrom Dedication; trained in Occultism or Curse Lore

Perhaps due to the curse within you, curses occasionally perceive you as an extension of themselves and readily reveal themselves to you. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to checks to Identify Magic on a cursed item or a spell that has the curse trait.
