# Solo Dancer
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** Fan Dancer Dedication; expert in Performance
* * *
You often dance alone with a grace exceeding that of most other performers, carrying yourself with a poise and confidence that draws the attention of those around you. You can always roll Performance for initiative, and during the first round of combat, creatures that act after you are [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] to you.
