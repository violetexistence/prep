# Fleeing Diversion
## Feat 2
### [[general]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** expert in Deception
* * *
You are quick to capitalize on your distractions. If you critically succeed at your check to [[Actions/Create a Diversion|Create a Diversion]] against the majority of the creatures (at least half of the creatures) whose attention you're trying to divert, you can use your reaction to immediately [[Actions/Hide|Hide]], [[Actions/Sneak|Sneak]], or Step. As normal, you are only [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] to creatures against which you succeed on your check to [[Actions/Create a Diversion|Create a Diversion]], even if you manage to Hide or Sneak away.
