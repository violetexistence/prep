# Keep Up the Good Fight `pf2:r`
## Feat 14
### [[guardian]]

**Category** class; 




**Frequency** once per hour

**Trigger** An enemy reduces you to 0 Hit Points but doesn't kill you.

* * *

Your commitment to protecting others keeps you going, even against insurmountable odds. Instead of being knocked out, you're reduced to 1 Hit Point. You increase your [[Conditions/Wounded|Wounded]] value by 1 and gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to your level that last for 1 round.
