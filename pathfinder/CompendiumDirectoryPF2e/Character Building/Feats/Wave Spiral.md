### [[flourish]][[monk]][[occult]][[water]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Reflective Ripple Stance
* * *
**Frequency** once per minute

**Requirements** You're in Reflective Ripple Stance.

You dip and spin, unleashing a wide whirlpool of water. Make an Athletics check to [[Actions/Trip|Trip]] each creature standing on the ground in a 10-foot emanation. These attacks all count toward your multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after you make all the attacks.
