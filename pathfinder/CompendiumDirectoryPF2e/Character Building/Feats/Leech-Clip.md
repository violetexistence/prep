# Leech-Clip `pf2:2`
## Feat 1
### [[hobgoblin]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You are trained to capture deserters, or "leeches." Make a melee Strike with weapon from the flail group. On a hit, the target takes a –10-foot status penalty to its Speed (or a –15-foot status penalty on a critical hit). The penalty lasts for 1 round. It applies only if the target has a land Speed and depends on legs or other targetable appendages to use its land Speed. As with all penalties to Speed, this can't reduce a creature's Speed below 5 feet.
