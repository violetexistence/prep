The flesh you've consumed over the course of your existence as a ghoul has made you stronger, gifting you with strange insights from the minds of the sapient creatures you've devoured and bringing you closer to a state of undead perfection. You gain the [[Ancestry Features/Advanced Undead Benefits|Advanced Undead Benefits]]. In addition, you gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speed while you're satiated.
