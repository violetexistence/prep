# Perfect Truths
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Razmiran Priest Dedication
* * *
Your knowledge of Razmir's faith and doctrines has grown. You excel in debating priests of rival faiths, wielding truths as subtly and deftly as any charlatan might wield a lie. When you use Deception to [[Actions/Lie|Lie]], you can carefully structure your deceits so that each individual statement you make is the truth, from a certain perspective.

As long as you are wearing your [[Equipment/Razmiri Mask|Razmiri Mask]], you don't take a penalty to Deception checks while subject to the [[Spells/Ring of Truth|Ring of Truth]] spell or similar effects. Whenever you are subject to _ring of truth_ or a similar effect, you can attempt a `Deception check` check when you first begin speaking to counteract the spell's effects, with a counteract rank equal to half your level (rounded up); succeeding at this check doesn't end the spell or effect, but it does cause it to indicate that you are speaking the truth, even when you are actually lying, as you weave a web of words so delicate that even you can't be certain where the truth ends and deception begins.
