# Spirit's Anguish `pf2:2`
## Feat 8
### [[archetype]][[sonic]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Exorcist Dedication
* * *
**Cost** 1 spirit wisp or spirit remnant from your spirit dwelling

**Requirements** You are holding your spirit dwelling.

* * *

You purify a spirit by coaxing it to release its anguish in a final cathartic howl. This deals sonic damage to all creatures in a 30-foot cone, with a `Will check` save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. If you expend a spirit wisp, this deals 1d4 sonic. If you expend a spirit remnant, this deals 1d6 sonic damage per level of the incorporeal undead or haunt from which you gained the remnant.
