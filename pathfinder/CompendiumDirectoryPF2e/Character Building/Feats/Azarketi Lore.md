# Azarketi Lore
## Feat 1
### [[azarketi]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You have learned the history and origins of your people and how to connect to both your land and sea heritage.

You become trained in Athletics and Nature. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in Azarketi Lore.

_Note: If you are already trained in the skill provided by this feat, you need to manually select an alternative skill. You also need to manually enter the granted Lore skill._
