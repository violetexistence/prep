# Second Sting `pf2:1`
## Feat 12
### [[press]][[ranger]]

**Category** class; 




**Requirements** You are wielding two melee weapons, each in a different hand.

* * *

You read your prey's movements and transform them into openings, so failures with one weapon set up glancing blows with the other. Make a melee Strike with one of the required weapons against your hunted prey. The Strike gains the following failure effect.

**Failure** You deal the damage the other required weapon would have dealt on a hit, excluding all damage dice. (This removes dice from weapon runes, spells, and special abilities, not just weapon damage dice.)
