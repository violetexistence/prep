# Tempo Duelist `pf2:1`
## Feat 16
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Aldori Duelist Dedication
* * *
You move with an unpredictable tempo, shifting between unnervingly slow and rapid movements. You are [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] for 1 round. As the nature of this effect still leaves your location obvious, you can't use this concealment to [[Actions/Hide|Hide]] or [[Actions/Sneak|Sneak]].
