**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** expert in Deception

You can set up a disguise in one-tenth the usual time (generally 1 minute). If you're a master in Deception, you can create a full disguise and [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] as a 3-action activity. If you're legendary, it takes a single action.
