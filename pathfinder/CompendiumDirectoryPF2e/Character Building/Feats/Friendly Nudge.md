# Friendly Nudge `pf2:1`
## Feat 1
### [[minotaur]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Athletics
* * *
You don't always have time to wait for your allies to make room, so it's best to politely move them yourself. Attempt an Athletics check to [[Actions/Shove|Shove]] an ally. You don't need to have a free hand to attempt this check. If your ally is willing, treat the result as one degree of success higher.
