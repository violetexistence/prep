# In Tune `pf2:1`
## Feat 4
### [[bard]][[concentrate]][[spellshape]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** maestro muse
* * *
You attune your great skill in performing to another, granting them a small measure of your skill as though anyone could do it. If your next action is casting a composition spell with an emanation area, its area spreads from a willing ally of your choice within 60 feet instead of you.

If you have [[Feats/Directed Audience|Directed Audience]], you can have that cone originate from the ally instead.
