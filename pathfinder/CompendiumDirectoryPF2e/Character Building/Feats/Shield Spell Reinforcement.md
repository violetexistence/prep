# Shield Spell Reinforcement `pf2:0`
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]][[spellshape]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** War Mage Dedication; you can cast the shield cantrip
* * *
**Requirements** You are wielding a shield.

* * *

You can empower your defensive magic by channeling it through a physical shield. If your next action is to cast the [[Spells/Shield|Shield]] cantrip, you use your shield as a locus to cast the spell, raising a magical barrier in the form of a large force projection of your worn shield. You can choose for an adjacent ally to gain the benefits of the _shield_ spell instead of yourself. If the ally would take damage from a physical attack while protected by your _shield_ cantrip, you can use your reaction to [[Feats/Shield Block|Shield Block]] with the spell on their behalf.
