# Faultless Defense `pf2:r`
## Feat 14
### [[mythic]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Eternal Legend Dedication
* * *
**Trigger** You would take damage from a Strike made by a creature.

* * *

As you are struck, your steely determination reminds those who fight you that they are destined to be no more than footnotes in your tale. Spend a Mythic Point to gain resistance equal to half your level to the triggering damage, and then attempt a Strike at mythic proficiency against the creature that attacked you. If the Strike hits and deals damage, the creature is also [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]].
