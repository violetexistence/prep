### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[mythic]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Artisan's Calling
* * *
You infuse a receptacle, such as a normal bag, sack, or box, with mythic power, transforming it into a prison into which you can command a creature. Spend a Mythic Point, and attempt a `Deception check`, `Diplomacy check`, or `Intimidation check` check at mythic proficiency against the Will DC of a creature within 30 feet to trick, convince, or command it into entering the receptacle. The receptacle can hold a creature of any size, and the creature enters the receptacle if your check is successful. The creature is [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]], is [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]], and has to hold its breath or start suffocating. A creature trapped in the receptacle can attempt to [[Actions/Escape|Escape]]; use the skill you used to lure the creature into the bag for the DC, and calculate the DC using mythic proficiency. The trapped creature is automatically freed after 1 minute, but you can spend an additional Mythic Point as a free action to prolong the duration of the containment for an additional minute when it would expire.
