# Fortunate Blow
## Feat 12
### [[commander]][[fortune]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Guiding Shot or Set-Up Strike
* * *
You set an enemy up for a devastating follow-through from your allies. When you successfully damage an opponent with either Guiding Shot or Set-Up Strike, the next creature other than you to attack the same target before the start of your next turn rolls twice on their attack roll and takes the higher result.
