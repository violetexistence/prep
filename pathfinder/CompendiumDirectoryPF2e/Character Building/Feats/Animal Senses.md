# Animal Senses
## Feat 1
### [[beastkin]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You gain one of the following senses available to your inherent animal: darkvision, low-light vision, or scent (imprecise) 30 feet. You must have low-light vision before you can gain darkvision with this feat. If your inherent animal doesn't typically have a specific type of sense, you can't gain that sense with this feat.
