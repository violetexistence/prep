# Armiger's Mobility
## Feat 8
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** expert in heavy armor; Hellknight Armiger Dedication
* * *
You've learned how best to move in heavy armor. When wearing heavy armor, if you meet the Strength requirement, instead of reducing the movement penalty by 5 feet, you reduce the penalty by 10 feet (typically reducing the penalty to 0). If you are a dwarf with the [[Feats/Unburdened Iron|Unburdened Iron]] feat, increase your Speed by 5 feet.
