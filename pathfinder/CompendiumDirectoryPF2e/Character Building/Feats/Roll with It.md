# Roll with It `pf2:r`
## Feat 9
### [[goblin]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** unbreakable goblin heritage; Bouncy Goblin
* * *
**Trigger** A foe hits you with a melee weapon or unarmed attack.

* * *

When you take a big hit, your foe bounces you around like a rubber ball, but you escape the worst of the blow. Your foe can move you any distance of its choice up to 30 feet in a direction of its choice (this is not forced movement, and it triggers reactions as normal). You fall [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] and are [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]]. Attempt a `DC 6 Flat check`. On a success, you take minimum damage from the attack, and on a critical success, if the attack was a critical hit, you don't take double damage from the critical hit.
