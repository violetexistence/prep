# Battleblooded
## Feat 1
### [[lineage]][[nephilim]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You descend from those whose lives were touched by legendary einherjars, who were crafted from the souls of mighty warriors slain in battle and chosen by valkyries to serve as foot soldiers to many gods. You may even be the distant mortal descendant of an actual valkyrie.

You are trained in Intimidation. If you were already trained in Intimidation (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also gain the [[Feats/Intimidating Glare|Intimidating Glare]] skill feat.
