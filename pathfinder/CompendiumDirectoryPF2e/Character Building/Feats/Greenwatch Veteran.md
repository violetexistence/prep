# Greenwatch Veteran `pf2:0`
## Feat 8
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[gunslinger]][[investigator]][[ranger]]

**Category** class; 




**Trigger** Your turn starts, and you're in combat against a creature you spent at least 10 minutes [[Actions/Track|Tracking]].

* * *

Your time spent tracking your target allows you to quickly identify its weaknesses and relay them to your allies. Attempt a [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] check against the creature you were Tracking. On a success, you always know the creature's greatest weakness and highest resistance or immunity, in addition to any other information the check would typically provide. You immediately use a quick series of hand gestures to signal this information to any allies who can see you.
