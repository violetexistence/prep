# Clobber `pf2:2`
## Feat 16
### [[guardian]]

**Category** class; 




**Requirements** You are wearing medium or heavy armor.

* * *

With a mighty blow, you send an enemy flying backward and onto the ground. Strike a foe. This Strike deals an extra die of weapon damage. If you hit and deal damage, you can automatically [[Actions/Shove|Shove]] the target, with the same benefits as the Shove action (including the critical success effect, if your Strike was a critical hit). The target then falls [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]. This counts as two attacks when calculating your multiple attack penalty.
