# Tanuki Lore
## Feat 1
### [[tanuki]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Tanuki love to play two things: tricks and music. You become trained in Deception and Performance. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.

You also gain the [[Feats/Additional Lore|Additional Lore]] general feat for Tanuki Lore.
