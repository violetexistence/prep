# Cryptic Spell `pf2:1`
## Feat 4
### [[concentrate]][[druid]][[manipulate]][[spellshape]]

**Category** class; 




**Requirements** You're in natural terrain.

* * *

You hide your magic in the croak of a frog, in the sway of the trees, in the howl of the wind, and the flicker of the will-o'-wisp. If the next action you take is to Cast a Spell, attempt a Nature check against all observers' Perception DCs. If you succeed at your check against an observer's Perception DC, that observer doesn't notice that you're Casting a Spell, even though verbal, somatic, and material components are usually noticeable, and spells normally have sensory manifestations that would make spellcasting obvious to those nearby. All of these are instead hidden in the natural sights and sounds of the environment.

This ability hides only the spell's spellcasting actions and manifestations, not its effects, so an observer might still see you transform into a giant bear.
