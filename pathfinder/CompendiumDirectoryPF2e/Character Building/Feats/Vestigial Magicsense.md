# Vestigial Magicsense
## Feat 1
### [[surki]]

**Category** ancestry; 




While most surkis' ability to taste magic fades once they metamorphose into their adult form—replaced by keener darkvision—you've retained some of this sense. You gain magicsense as a vague sense that has a range of 30 feet—like all vague senses, it's only about as precise as an average human's sense of smell, meaning you generally can predict only if magic is present; however, each tradition of magic has a unique taste to you, allowing you to identify the tradition of magic present.
