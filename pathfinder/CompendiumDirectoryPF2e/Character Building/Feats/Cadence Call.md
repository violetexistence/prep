# Cadence Call `pf2:1`
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]][[auditory]][[flourish]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Marshal Dedication
* * *
**Frequency** once per minute

* * *

You call out a quick cadence, guiding your allies into a more efficient rhythm. Each willing ally in your marshal's aura is [[Conditions/Quickened|Quickened]] until the end of their next turn, and they can use the extra action only to Stride.

If an ally uses this extra action, at the end of its turn that ally becomes [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] until the end of its following turn.
