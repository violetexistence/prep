# Zealous Inevitability `pf2:1`
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]][[flourish]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Avenger Dedication
* * *
**Requirements** You are wielding your deity's favored weapon

* * *

You channel your zeal through a sacred weapon, bringing a foe closer to their demise. Strike a target with the required weapon. on a success, the target becomes [[Conditions/Doomed|Doomed 1]] or increases the value of their doomed condition by 1 (most living creatures die when they've reached doomed 4). Creatures doomed in this way take a status penalty to their saving throws against divine spells equal to their doomed value.

[[Feat_Feature Effects/Effect_ Zealous Inevitability|Effect: Zealous Inevitability]]

A creature that would become doomed 4 by this Strike can attempt a `Will check` saving throw against your class DC to avoid increasing the value of their doomed condition. When this occurs, this ability gains the incapacitation trait.
