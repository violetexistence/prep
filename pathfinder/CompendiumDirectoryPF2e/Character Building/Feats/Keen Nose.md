# Keen Nose
## Feat 1
### [[minotaur]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Accustomed to the foul air of underground tunnels, your sense of smell is sharpened, and noxious scents are less offensive. You gain scent as an imprecise sense with a range of 30 feet. You also gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Fortitude saves against olfactory effects that cause the sickened condition.
