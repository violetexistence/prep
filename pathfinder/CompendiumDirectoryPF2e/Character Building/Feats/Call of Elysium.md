# Call of Elysium
## Feat 9
### [[nephilim]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Musetouched
* * *
The wild wonder of Elysium harmonizes within you, and in dire straits, you can share its benefits with your allies.

Your Speed increases by 5 feet; the Speed increase from this feat isn't cumulative with any Speed increase from your ancestry feats (such as [[Feats/Nimble Elf|Nimble Elf]]).

Allies who begin their turn in combat adjacent to you gain a +5-foot status bonus to their Speed for the round.
