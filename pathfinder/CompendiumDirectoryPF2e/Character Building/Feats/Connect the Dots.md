# Connect the Dots `pf2:2`
## Feat 6
### [[auditory]][[concentrate]][[investigator]][[linguistic]]

**Category** class; 




Ephemeral connections between people, places, and concepts are invisible to most, but seeing them is your stock and trade. Choose an ally and a non-allied creature. You must be able to see both of them. You briefly study the way they both move and attempt a `Perception check` check against the higher of the non-allied creature's Deception DC or Will DC. Both targets are then temporarily immune to Connect the Dots for 10 minutes.

**Critical Success** You spot a way for your ally to take advantage of the other target's flaws and let them know about it. Your ally gains your [[Actions/Pursue a Lead|Pursue a Lead]] investigation bonus as a circumstance bonus to all its Strikes or skill checks against the creature until the start of your next turn.

**Success** As critical success, but your ally gains the bonus only for their next Strike or skill check against the creature.

[[Feat_Feature Effects/Effect_ Connect the Dots|Effect: Connect the Dots]]

**Failure** You fail to make a connection.

**Critical Failure** You misconstrue a vital piece of information, which temporarily disconcerts you. You are [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] until the end of your next turn.
