# Rain of Rust `pf2:3`
## Feat 4
### [[composite]][[impulse]][[kineticist]][[metal]][[primal]][[water]]

**Category** class; 




You conjure a red raincloud in a 10-foot burst within 60 feet, which pours rust-colored rain directly below it. Any creature in the rain with the metal trait, that is made of metal, or is wearing metal armor is covered in corrosive build-up. Any such creature is [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] as long as it remains in the area. If such a creature is in the rain at the start of its turn, it takes 1d6 untyped damage with a `Fortitude check` save against your class DC, plus 1d6 persistent untyped damage if it fails. Damage from this impulse ignores Hardness. The cloud lasts 1 minute but ends if you use the impulse again.

**Level (+2)** The initial damage increases by 1d6.
