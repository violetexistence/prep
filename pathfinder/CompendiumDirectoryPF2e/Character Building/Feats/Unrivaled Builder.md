### [[shoony]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Handy with Your Paws
* * *
Building things is like solving a puzzle, and you know how to use anything at your disposal to get the job done. You gain [[Spells/Creation|Creation]] as a 5th-rank innate primal spell. You must have an equivalent Bulk of material to create an item, such as wood or scrap metal to make a wheelbarrow. You can cast this spell once each day.
