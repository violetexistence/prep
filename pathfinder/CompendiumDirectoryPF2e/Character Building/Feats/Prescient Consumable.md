# Prescient Consumable
## Feat 7
### [[general]]

**Category** general; 



**Prerequisites** Prescient Planner
* * *
You can predict which consumables you might need in advance. When using [[Feats/Prescient Planner|Prescient Planner]], you can procure a consumable item from your backpack, instead of a piece of adventuring gear. The consumable item must still be common with a level no higher than half your level, and its Bulk must be low enough that carrying it wouldn't have made you encumbered.
