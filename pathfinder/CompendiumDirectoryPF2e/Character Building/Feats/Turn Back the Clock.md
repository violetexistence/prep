# Turn Back the Clock `pf2:r`
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]][[concentrate]][[fortune]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Chronoskimmer Dedication
* * *
**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** You fail a skill check or saving throw.

After failing a test of skill, you hop back in your personal timeline so you can try again. You reroll the triggering check with a +1 circumstance bonus as you apply your experience from your last attempt. You must use the new result, even if it's worse than your first roll.
