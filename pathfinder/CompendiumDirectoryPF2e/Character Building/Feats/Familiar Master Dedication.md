# Familiar Master Dedication
## Feat 2
### [[archetype]][[dedication]]

**Category** class; 




You have forged a mystical bond with a creature. This might have involved complex rituals and invocations, such as meditating under the moon until something crept out of the forest. Or maybe you just did each other a good turn, such as rescuing the beast from a trap or a foe, and then being rescued in turn.

Whatever the details, you are now comrades until the end. You gain a familiar. If you already have a familiar, you gain the [[Feats/Enhanced Familiar|Enhanced Familiar]] feat.
