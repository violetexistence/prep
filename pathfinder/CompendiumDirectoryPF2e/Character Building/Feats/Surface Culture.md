# Surface Culture
## Feat 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[dwarf]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Access** any surface dwarf ethnicity

* * *

Your interactions with other cultures on the surface have not only taught you about many other ancestries, but have also helped you realize the value of your own. You gain the trained proficiency rank in the Society skill (or another skill of your choice if you were already trained in Society), and you gain the [[Feats/Additional Lore|Additional Lore]] skill feat for the Lore corresponding to your culture (for instance, Ouat Lore or Pahmet Lore).
