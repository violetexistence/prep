# Shadow Spell `pf2:1`
## Feat 8
### [[archetype]][[shadow]][[spellshape]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Shadowcaster Dedication
* * *
You attach a piece of your shadow to a spell to cloud the senses and cause mischief. If the next action you take is to Cast a Spell that has the shadow trait, choose one creature affected by the spell. This creature either gains a +2 status bonus to Stealth or takes a -2 status penalty to Perception (your choice). This lasts for 1 round. This choice and the effect occur after resolving any checks for the spell's initial effects. If the chosen creature is your enemy, it's affected only if your spell attack roll succeeded or if it failed its saving throw.

The effects of _Shadow Spell_ end if you use _Shadow Spell_ again.
