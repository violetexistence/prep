# Crashing Slam
## Feat 10
### [[fighter]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Slam Down
* * *
You can dash your foe to the ground with a single blow. When you use Slam Down, instead of making a Strike followed by a [[Actions/Trip|Trip]], you can attempt a single Strike. If you do and your Strike hits, instead of rolling a check for your Trip attempt, you automatically apply the critical success effect of a Trip. If you used a two-handed melee weapon for the Strike, you can use the weapon's damage die size instead of the regular die size for the damage from a critical Trip.
