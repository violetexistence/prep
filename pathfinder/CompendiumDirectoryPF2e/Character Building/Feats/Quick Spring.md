Ishii Bunji is a skilled tumbler, and learning his technique allows you to push yourself off a foe and propel yourself across the battlefield faster. If you succeed at an Acrobatics check to [[Actions/Tumble Through|Tumble Through]] an enemy's space, you can Stride again as a free action after you complete your current movement.
