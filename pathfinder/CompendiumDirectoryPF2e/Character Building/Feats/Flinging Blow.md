# Flinging Blow `pf2:2`
## Feat 16
### [[monk]]

**Category** class; 




You take a moment to center yourself, then unleash a powerful blow that sends your target tumbling away.

Make an unarmed Strike. If you hit, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC or be pushed up to 10 feet directly away from you (or 20 feet, on a critical failure) and fall [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]].

If another creature or physical object would prevent this movement, both your target and the blocking creature or object take 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 5 feet of movement that was prevented.
