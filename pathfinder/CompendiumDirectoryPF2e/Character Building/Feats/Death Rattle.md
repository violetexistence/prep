# Death Rattle `pf2:1`
## Feat 14
### [[archetype]][[concentrate]][[magical]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Necrologist Dedication
* * *
**Requirements** Your horde is raised.

* * *

When the time comes for your horde to be returned to its temporary rest, its departure carries those nearby closer to death. Dismiss your raised horde, which draws life energy toward it as it crumbles to the ground and fades away. Each living creature within your horde's space or in a 5-foot emanation around it must attempt a `Fortitude check` saving throw against your spell DC or become [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]] ([[Conditions/Drained|Drained 2]] on a critical failure).
