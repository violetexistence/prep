# In Plain Sight
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** Alter Ego Dedication
* * *
People often only see what they want to see, a weakness you know how to take full advantage of. While you've Assumed a Role, you can use Deception in place of Stealth when using the [[Actions/Avoid Notice|Avoid Notice]] exploration activity in an area where someone with your role wouldn't be unusual, such as when impersonating a sailor or fisher when infiltrating the docks.
