# Triggerbrand Salvo `pf2:1`
## Feat 6
### [[flourish]][[gunslinger]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Way of the Triggerbrand
* * *
**Requirements** You're wielding a combination weapon.

* * *

You slice, stab, or batter your opponent with the melee portion of your combination weapon before pulling the trigger at point-blank range. Make a melee Strike with your combination weapon. If the Strike is successful, you can immediately make a ranged Strike against the same target with that combination weapon, and you get a +2 circumstance bonus to the attack roll. This counts as two attacks toward your multiple attack penalty, but you don't apply the multiple attack penalty until after making both attacks.
