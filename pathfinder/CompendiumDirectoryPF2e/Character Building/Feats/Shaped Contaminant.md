# Shaped Contaminant
## Feat 12
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[alchemist]]

**Category** class; 




Through a combination of careful manipulation and precise breath control, you can deploy inhaled toxins precisely. When you activate an inhaled poison, you can cause it to fill a 20-foot line that's 5 feet tall rather than a 10-foot cube. You gain a +3 status bonus to saving throws against inhaled poisons that you activate.
