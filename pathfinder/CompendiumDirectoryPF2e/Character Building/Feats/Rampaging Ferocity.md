# Rampaging Ferocity `pf2:0`
## Feat 17
### [[orc]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Orc Ferocity
* * *
**Trigger** You use [[Feats/Orc Ferocity|Orc Ferocity]].

* * *

You lash out viciously even as you fend off death. Make a single melee Strike. If this Strike brings a foe to 0 Hit Points, this activation of Orc Ferocity doesn't count against its frequency.
