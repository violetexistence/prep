# Reincarnated Ridiculer
## Feat 5
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[reincarnated]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You've practiced the art of taunting an enemy, ensuring they know death will only make you stronger. When you [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] an opponent, the target doesn't become temporarily immune to your attempts to Demoralize it unless you critically fail the check. If the target critically hit you with a Strike on its previous turn, the DC for this check is reduced by 4.
