## Feat 4
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[mythic]]

**Category** class; 




**Trigger** You're about to roll initiative.

Mythic power floods through your mind, filling you with visions of possible futures, events that might or might not happen, and warnings of things that might be. Spend a Mythic Point and roll your initiative check using mythic proficiency. Until the end of your first turn, you have a +1 status bonus to AC and all saves.
