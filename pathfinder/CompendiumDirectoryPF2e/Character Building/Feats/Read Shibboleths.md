# Read Shibboleths
## Feat 7
### [[archetype]][[linguistic]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** Linguist Dedication; master in Society
* * *
All communication is filled with slight tells and signals. If you interact with someone for at least 10 minutes, their regional words, pronunciation changes, and nonverbal cues provide you with a minor fact about their social environment, such as their hometown or certain groups they might belong to.

If a target of this ability is being deceptive about their social environment, such as a commoner pretending to be a noble, they must attempt a Deception, Society, or appropriate Lore check against your Society DC, providing you a false minor fact consistent with their assumed identity on a success.

Once you've gleaned one or more true minor facts about a person, you can then incorporate these mannerisms into your speech to present yourself in a way that they find familiar. This grants you a +1 circumstance bonus to your Diplomacy and Deception checks with them.
