# Friendly Fling `pf2:2`
## Feat 9
### [[manipulate]][[minotaur]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Requirements** You are adjacent to an ally.

* * *

You can scoop up your friends with your horns to hurl them across the battlefield. Pick up an adjacent willing ally who is smaller than you and toss them to an unoccupied space you can see within 20 feet. Since you are using your horns, you don't need to have any hands free to do this. Your ally's movement doesn't trigger reactions. Your ally ends this movement on their feet and doesn't take damage from the fall but takes 1d6 piercing damage from your horns. If your ally ends this movement within melee reach of at least one enemy, they can make a melee Strike against an enemy within their reach as a reaction.
