# Coordinated Charge `pf2:2`
## Feat 12
### [[archetype]][[visual]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Marshal Dedication
* * *
You heroically dash into the fray, inspiring your allies to follow. You Stride up to your Speed and make a melee Strike. If your Strike hits and damages an enemy, each ally within 60 feet who saw you hit can use a reaction to Stride, but they each must end their Stride closer to the creature you hit than where they started.
