# Nagaji Spell Familiarity
## Feat 1
### [[nagaji]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Either through study, exposure, or familial devotion, you have the magic of nagas bubbling in your blood. During your daily preparations, choose [[Spells/Daze|Daze]], [[Actions/Detect Magic|Detect Magic]], or [[Spells/Telekinetic Hand|Telekinetic Hand]]. Until your next daily preparations, you can cast the chosen spell as an occult innate cantrip. A cantrip is heightened to a spell rank equal to half your level rounded up.
