# Veil May
## Feat 1
### [[changeling]][[lineage]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Born of a blood hag, a fiery blood drinker hidden behind a false skin, you have one blood-red eye and the ability to slough off your appearance in an instant.

You gain the [[Feats/Lie to Me|Lie to Me]] skill feat, and you can shed a disguise quickly by peeling off the outer layer of your skin.

Changing from a disguise used to [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] back to your true appearance is a 3-action activity for you; if you're an expert in Deception, it's a 2-action activity, and if you're legendary in Deception, it takes only a single action. This doesn't allow you to don or remove armor or other equipment any faster, but your physical appearance otherwise returns to its normal state.
