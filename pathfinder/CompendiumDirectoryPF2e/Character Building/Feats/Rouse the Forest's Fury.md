# Rouse the Forest's Fury `pf2:3`
## Feat 18
### [[impulse]][[kineticist]][[overflow]][[plant]][[primal]][[wood]]

**Category** class; 




Terrifying trees attack your enemies. Three Large trees appear in unoccupied spaces within 500 feet, at least 15 feet from one another. Each tree has AC 40, Fortitude +33, Reflex +24, Will +30, and 200 HP. The trees can flank, but are unable to move. When the trees appear, each makes a Strike; they share a multiple attack penalty. The tree's melee Strike is a branch that has reach 10 feet; on a hit, the target is [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] by the tree ([[Actions/escape dc=40|escape dc=40]]). The ranged Strike is a hurled fruit, gourd, seed, or stone with a range increment of 60 feet. Either Strike has a +30 attack modifier and deals 4d10+9 bludgeoning damage.

The trees last until the end of your next turn, and you can Sustain the impulse. Each time you Sustain the impulse, you can have one tree make a Strike.

**Level (20th)** The attack modifier is +32 and the Strike damage is 5d10+9.
