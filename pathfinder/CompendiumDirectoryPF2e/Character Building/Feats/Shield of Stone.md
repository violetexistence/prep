# Shield of Stone
## Feat 6
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[exemplar]][[ikon]]

**Category** class; 




**Usage** imbued into the mirror aegis

* * *

You stole a gorgon's gaze and trapped it in your ikon. You've learned how to brandish it for your advantage, subduing the rage of the trapped gaze by turning it on your enemies.

**Transcendenceâ€”[[Actions/Brandish the Gorgon's Gaze|Brandish the Gorgon's Gaze]]** `pf2:1` (earth, transcendence, visual)

**Effect** You Raise your mirrored aegis, though it seems to lose some of its usual luster in favor of the dull sheen of stone. If you Shield Block a melee attack with the mirrored aegis before the beginning of your next turn, the gorgon's eyes upon it flash at the triggering creature, who must attempt a `Fortitude check` save against your class DC. On a failure, they are [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] for 1 minute as their body partially petrifies. Regardless of the outcome, that creature is temporarily immune to this effect for 24 hours.
