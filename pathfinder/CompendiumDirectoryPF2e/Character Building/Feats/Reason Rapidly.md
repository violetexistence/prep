### [[investigator]]

**Category** class; 




Your mind works through clues at an unbelievable speed. You instantly use up to five [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] actions. If you have any special abilities or free actions that would normally be triggered when you Recall Knowledge, you can't use them for these actions.
