## Feat 6
### [[bravado]][[swashbuckler]]

**Category** class; 




You tumble around your foes, expertly avoiding their reactions. Stride up to half your Speed and roll an `Acrobatics check` check. Compare the result to the Reflex DC of each enemy whose reach you began in or enter during the movement, in sequence.

* * *

**Critical Success** This movement doesn't trigger reactions from the enemy, and the enemy is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] to you until the end of your turn

**Success** This movement doesn't trigger reactions from the enemy.

**Critical Failure** Your movement immediately stops when you enter the creature's reach; if you began in the creature's reach, you don't move.
