# Loud Singer
## Feat 5
### [[goblin]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Goblin Song

Staying on pitch, proper breath control, and remembering the words are all less important than the real measure of a good singer: volume! The range of your Goblin Song is increased to 60 feet, and you can target one additional enemy when you use it.
