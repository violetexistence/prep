# Extraplanar Haze `pf2:2`
## Feat 5
### [[nephilim]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per day

* * *

Your body emits tiny particles of extraplanar matter, such as crystalline motes or smoky vapor, that surround you in a haze. You become [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]], though you can't use this concealment to [[Actions/Hide|Hide]] or [[Actions/Sneak|Sneak]], as normal for concealment where your position is still obvious. These particles stay within an inch of your skin, move with you, and last for a number of rounds equal to half your level.
