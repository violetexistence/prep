# Sacral Lord
## Feat 4
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[champion]][[oracle]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Occultism or Religion
* * *
By right of ritual or sheer stubbornness, you have claimed rulership of the land. Claim a defined territory, such as a small section of forest or river, or a district of a larger city. Within its borders, you can cast [[Spells/Detect Magic|Detect Magic]], [[Spells/Guidance|Guidance]], and [[Spells/Sigil|Sigil]] as innate divine cantrips, and you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] on creatures that have the celestial, fiend, fey, monitor, or spirit traits.

* * *

**Special** You and your land are linked. Changes to one mirror themselves on the other-if you're depressed, gray rain and clammy mist might set in. These effects have no immediate mechanical impact, but they might give clues about problems afflicting the land.
