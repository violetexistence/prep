# Blessed Spell `pf2:1`
## Feat 8
### [[archetype]][[concentrate]][[spellshape]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Blessed One Dedication; ability to cast spells from spell slots; Mercy
* * *
**Frequency** once per 10 minutes

* * *

When you focus your magic on an ally, you can remove harmful conditions.

If your next action is to [[Actions/Cast a Spell|Cast a Spell]] from a spell slot, and that spell targets only a single ally, you can also attempt to remove a harmful condition from that ally. The condition must be one that could be removed by your Mercy feat, including those granted by later feats such as [[Feats/Greater Mercy|Greater Mercy]].

Attempt a counteract check based on the spell's DC and level. This effect is in addition to the normal effects of your spell.
