# Lie to Me
## Feat 1
### [[general]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Deception
* * *
You can use Deception to weave traps to trip up anyone trying to deceive you. If you can engage in conversation with someone trying to [[Actions/Lie|Lie]] to you, use your Deception DC if it is higher than your Perception DC to determine whether they succeed. This doesn't apply if you don't have a back-and-forth dialogue, such as when someone attempts to Lie during a long speech.
