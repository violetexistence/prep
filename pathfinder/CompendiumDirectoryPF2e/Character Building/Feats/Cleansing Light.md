# Cleansing Light `pf2:2`
## Feat 17
### [[concentrate]][[kashrishi]][[light]][[occult]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per day

* * *

A burst of light from your horn cleanses your allies of ailments and sends your foes reeling. You and all allies in a 20-foot emanation benefit from a 4th-rank [[Spells/Restoration|Restoration]] spell. All enemies within the emanation are [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] until the end of your next turn.
