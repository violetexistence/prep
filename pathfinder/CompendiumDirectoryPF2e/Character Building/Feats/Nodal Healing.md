You can induce wound repair by circulating magic throughout your body. If you rest for 10 minutes, you regain Hit Points equal to your Constitution modifier Ã— half your level. This is a magical healing effect and is cumulative with any healing you receive from [[Actions/Treat Wounds|Treat Wounds]].
