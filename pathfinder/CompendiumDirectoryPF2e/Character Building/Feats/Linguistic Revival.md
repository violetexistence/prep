# Linguistic Revival
## Feat 13
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[reincarnated]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You achieved fluency in different languages with each reincarnation, and your brain remembers much of the grammar, idioms, and obscenities that you spouted in old lives. You gain [[Spells/Truespeech|Truespeech]] as a 5th-rank occult innate spell that you can cast once a day on yourself only. While the spell is active, you get a +2 circumstance bonus to Diplomacy checks while speaking to a creature in a language other than Common.
