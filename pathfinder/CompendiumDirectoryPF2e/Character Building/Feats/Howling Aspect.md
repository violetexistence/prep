Pulling your hair loose into flames and gnashing your teeth into ragged fangs, you howl a vow of ire, and your form surges to meet the demands of your deadly promise. For the next minute, you gain two unarmed attacks. You gain a tusks melee unarmed attack that deals 1d6 piercing damage, is in the brawling group, and has the finesse and unarmed traits. You also gain a flame-hair melee unarmed attack that deals 1d4 fire damage, is in the brawling group, and has the agile, finesse, and unarmed traits.
