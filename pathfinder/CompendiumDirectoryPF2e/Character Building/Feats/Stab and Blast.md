# Stab and Blast `pf2:1`
## Feat 8
### [[flourish]][[gunslinger]]

**Category** class; 




**Requirements** You're wielding a firearm with an attached bayonet or reinforced stock, a fire lance, or a combination weapon.

* * *

You slice or smash your opponent with the melee portion of your weapon before pulling the trigger at point-blank range. Make a melee Strike with the required weapon. If the Strike is successful, you can immediately make a ranged Strike against the same target with a +2 circumstance bonus to the attack roll. This counts as two attacks toward your multiple attack penalty, but you don't apply the multiple attack penalty until after making both attacks.
