# Bless Tonic
## Feat 7
### [[general]][[skill]][[vitality]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** master in Crafting; deity who grants heal divine font
* * *
You channel vitality energy into restoratives that ward against harm. When you [[Actions/Craft|Craft]] an alchemical item that restores Hit Points (rather than create it with advanced alchemy, Quick Alchemy, or another means), it becomes a blessed alchemical item and gains the vitality trait. For example, an [[Equipment/Elixir of Life (Minor)|Elixir of Life]] would become a blessed elixir of life. When a creature regains Hit Points using a blessed alchemical item, the overflowing energy grants them void resistance 5 for 1 round, or void resistance 10 if you are legendary in Crafting.
