**Category** ancestry; 




Escaping your nets is no simple task. The Athletics DC to [[Actions/Force Open|Force Open]] or [[Actions/Escape|Escape]] your nets increases from 16 to 18. After a creature you [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] with a net Escapes or Forces Open the net, stray strands of the net cling to the creature, causing them to remain [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the beginning of their next turn.
