# Forgotten Presence
## Feat 8
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[druid]]

**Category** class; 




The world conspires to keep you forgotten and unnoticed-memories cloud, ink stains out your name in ledgers, and portraits of you crack and warp over your face. Characters attempting to Recall Knowledge about you take a -2 circumstance penalty. Add [[Spells/Rewrite Memory|Rewrite Memory]] to your spell list as a primal spell.
