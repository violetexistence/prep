### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Clockwork Reanimator Dedication
* * *
You built your reanimated construct companion of modular components from various corpses. Its unique makeup enables your companion to split into dozens or even hundreds of much smaller corpse constructs. Acting as one, this shambling swarm can overwhelm your enemies.

You Command your reanimated construct companion. Instead of its normal actions, the companion splits into a horde of Small and Tiny construct companions within a 30-foot emanation from its original space. The horde makes a Strike against each foe within the emanation with a +2 circumstance bonus to its attack rolls. The multiple attack penalty doesn't increase until after the companion makes all the attacks. The miniature companions recombine into a single companion of their original size at any location within the emanation.
