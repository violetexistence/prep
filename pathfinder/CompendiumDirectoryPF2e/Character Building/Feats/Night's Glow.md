# Night's Glow
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]][[occult]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Oatia Skysage Dedication
* * *
The stars and moon lend you their light. You gain your choice of the [[Spells/Moonbeam|Moonbeam]] or [[Spells/Zenith Star|Zenith Star]] domain spell. Like your Oatia skysage spells, you cast this focus spell as an occult spell.

**Special** You can take this feat a second time, gaining the focus spell that you didn't gain the first time.
