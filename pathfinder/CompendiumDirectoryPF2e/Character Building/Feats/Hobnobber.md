# Hobnobber
## Feat 1
### [[general]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Diplomacy
* * *
You are skilled at learning information through conversation. The [[Actions/Gather Information|Gather Information]] exploration activity takes you half as long as normal (typically reducing the time to 1 hour). If you're a master in Diplomacy and roll a critical failure to Gather Information, you get a failure instead. There is still no guarantee that a rumor you learn with Gather Information is accurate.
