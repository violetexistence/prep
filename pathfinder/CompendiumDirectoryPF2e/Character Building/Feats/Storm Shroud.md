## Feat 8
### [[archetype]][[concentrate]][[divine]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Mummy Dedication

**Frequency** once per hour

You become surrounded by a swirling storm of rain, sand, snow, or clouds, whichever of those suits your bound terrain. This activity has traits appropriate to the storm you create-typically earth for sand and water for rain, snow, or clouds. You become [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] for 1 minute. You can't use this concealment to Hide or [[Actions/Sneak|Sneak]], as normal for concealment that makes your position obvious.
