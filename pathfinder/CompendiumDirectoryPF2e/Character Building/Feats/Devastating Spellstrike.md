# Devastating Spellstrike `pf2:2`
## Feat 4
### [[magus]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Arcane Cascade; inexorable iron hybrid study; Spellstrike
* * *
**Requirements** You are in Arcane Cascade stance and your Spellstrike is charged.

* * *

Your Spellstrike sweeps are so wide and devastating, they splash onto nearby foes. Make a Spellstrike. Foes adjacent to the target take splash damage equal to 2 + the extra damage from Arcane Cascade. The damage type is the same as Arcane Cascade; if the spell already deals splash damage of the same type, combine the damage together before applying weaknesses or resistances.
