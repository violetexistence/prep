# Security
## Feat 4
### [[champion]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** shields of the spirit
* * *
Those you shield can benefit from your lasting protection. You can cast [[Spells/Shields of the Spirit|Shields of the Spirit]] using 2 actions instead of 1. If you do, you can choose one ally in your champion's aura to gain a spirit shield that accompanies it. For 1 minute, that ally gains the benefits of _shields of the spirit_, even while the ally isn't in your champion's aura and even if your shield isn't raised. If you create another companion shield, any previous one ends.
