# Urgent Upwelling `pf2:r`
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Wellspring Mage Dedication
* * *
**Frequency** once per 10 minutes

**Trigger** An enemy reduces you to 0 HP, an enemy critically hits you, or you critically fail a saving throw against an enemy's effect.

* * *

Defeat lets you to tap into your wellspring. Attempt the flat check for wellspring magic. If you critically succeed, you can choose to forgo gaining a temporary spell slot to instead have the triggering enemy undergo a wellspring surge. This surge functions just as it would for you, the only difference being that it emits from the enemy.
