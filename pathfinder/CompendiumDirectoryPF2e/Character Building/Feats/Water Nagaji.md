# Water Nagaji
## Feat 1
### [[nagaji]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Much like a water naga, you've formed a connection to a sacred or pristine body of water, either as a home or a place to protect. You gain the [[Feats/Breath Control|Breath Control]] general feat as a bonus feat and a swim Speed of 10 feet.
