### [[general]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** legendary in Stealth; Swift Sneak
* * *
You're always sneaking unless you choose to be seen, even when there's nowhere to hide. You can [[Actions/Hide|Hide]] and [[Actions/Sneak|Sneak]] even without cover or being [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]]. When you employ an exploration tactic other than [[Actions/Avoid Notice|Avoiding Notice]], you also gain the benefits of Avoiding Notice unless you choose not to.
