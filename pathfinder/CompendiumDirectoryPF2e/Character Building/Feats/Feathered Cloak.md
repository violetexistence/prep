You receive a +2 circumstance bonus to Deception checks to [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] a version of yourself who is not a strix. Additionally, your folded wings help you obscure objects on your person, providing a +2 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks to [[Actions/Conceal an Object|Conceal an Object]].
