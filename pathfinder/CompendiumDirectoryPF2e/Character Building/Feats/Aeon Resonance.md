# Aeon Resonance
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Embed Aeon Stone
* * *
You gain the resonant power of one embedded aeon stone as if it were placed in a [[Equipment/Wayfinder|Wayfinder]]. While you can embed multiple aeon stones in your flesh, you can gain the resonance power from only one embedded stone at a time, selected each day when you make your daily preparations.

* * *

**Special** At 8th level, you can take this feat again. If you do, you gain the resonance powers of up to four invested aeon stones instead of only one.

* * *

_PFS Note:_ This feat acts as if an aeon stone was embedded in a _wayfinder_, and thus would not allow a second aeon stone to provide its resonance power from being embedded in a _wayfinder_.
