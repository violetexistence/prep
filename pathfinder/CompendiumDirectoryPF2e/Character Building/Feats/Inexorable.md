You imbue yourself with the resilience of the cave worm. When you gain the [[Conditions/Paralyzed|Paralyzed]], [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed]], or [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned]] condition, roll a `DC 15 Flat check`. On a success you ignore the condition.

When using Worm Form you are immune to penalties to your Speed and the [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] condition, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Fortitude or Reflex DC against attempts to [[Actions/Shove|Shove]] or [[Actions/Trip|Trip]] you, and you ignore difficult terrain and greater difficult terrain.
