You know story after story of unyielding, valiant dwarven heroes whose minds were bulwarks against fear and confusion. You can use [[Feats/Stalwart Song|Stalwart Song]] when attempting a saving throw against any mental effect, and if you fail the saving throw, you gain resistance to mental damage against any resulting effect equal to half your level.
