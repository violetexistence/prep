# Telepathic Union
## Feat 16
### [[linguistic]][[mental]][[mythic]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Beast Lord Dedication
* * *
Your union is so strong, you can communicate with each other without uttering a word, even across vast distances. You and your united companion can communicate telepathically while within 1 mile of each other as if you were speaking your shared language. You and your companion can also sense each other's general emotions as long as you are on the same plane, allowing you to know if the other is in peril or under great distress.
