# Just the Facts
## Feat 20
### [[investigator]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Thorough Research
* * *
You fundamentally understand everything to the point where your research can't possibly be wrong. You are permanently [[Conditions/Quickened|Quickened]] and can use the extra action to [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]]. In addition, you gain the following benefits with Recall Knowledge.

*   Your checks to Recall Knowledge are no longer secret.
*   When you Recall Knowledge, you use the outcome for one degree of success better than the result of your check.
*   If an effect (such as [[Feats/Dubious Knowledge|Dubious Knowledge]]) would give you inaccurate information from your Recall Knowledge check, you know which information is inaccurate.
*   When one of your allies Recalls Knowledge and gains false information, you also know that information is inaccurate if they share it with you
