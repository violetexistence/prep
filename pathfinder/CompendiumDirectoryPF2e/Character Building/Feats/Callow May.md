# Callow May
## Feat 1
### [[changeling]][[lineage]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You are among the most common of changelings—those born to sweet hags—and a vibrant green eye signifies that parentage. Your mother's manipulative nature and versatile voice gives you an edge when deceiving others. You gain the [[Feats/Charming Liar|Charming Liar]] skill feat. If you roll Deception for initiative, foes in that combat encounter that haven't acted yet are [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] against you.
