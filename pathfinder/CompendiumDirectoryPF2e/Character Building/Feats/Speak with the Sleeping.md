# Speak with the Sleeping
## Feat 5
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[sprite]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Access** Tian Xia origin

* * *

You can speak to all inanimate objects and the slumbering spirits within them. Once per day, you can speak to an object and ask it a question to gain the effects of [[Spells/Object Reading|Object Reading]], though the object gives you its response 1 minute later (as it takes the spirit within the object some time to rouse). An object's ability to answer is limited by its particular nature; a pair of shoes might know where their owner has walked, while a house knows the history of the denizens within, but not what they do elsewhere.
