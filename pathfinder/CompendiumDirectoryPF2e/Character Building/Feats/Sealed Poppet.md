# Sealed Poppet
## Feat 5
### [[poppet]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You've reinforced your interior parts with sealant or other flame-retardant materials, protecting you from fire. You no longer have the weakness to fire from the flammable ability.

**Special** You can't take this feat if you're a stuffed poppet.
