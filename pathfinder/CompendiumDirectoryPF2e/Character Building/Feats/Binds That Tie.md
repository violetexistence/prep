# Binds That Tie
## Feat 2
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[mythic]]

**Category** class; 




You excel at assisting in capturing your foes. When you attempt a check to [[Actions/Grapple|Grapple]] an opponent who's already [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] by an ally, you can spend a Mythic Point to attempt the check at mythic proficiency. On a success, you deal additional bludgeoning damage to the target equal to twice your Strength modifier.
