## Feat 20
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[sorcerer]]

**Category** class; 




You have learned to manipulate the innate power of your bloodline and adapt it to your needs. When making your daily preparations, you can swap out a single spell of 9th rank or lower for another spell of the same rank. You can't swap out spells granted specifically by your bloodline.
