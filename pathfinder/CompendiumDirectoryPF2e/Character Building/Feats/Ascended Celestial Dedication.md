# Ascended Celestial Dedication
## Feat 12
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[destiny]][[mythic]]

**Category** class; 




Your Calling has driven you to perform mortal deeds that will result in your ascension to the ranks of celestials. You're headstrong and determined and hardly waver in your resolve; once per hour, you can roll twice and use the higher result on a Will saving throw. If you ever become [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]], rather than attack wildly, you become stubbornly immobile, wasting all your actions until the condition ends.

Additionally, you emanate a nimbus of light. You shed bright light in a 30-foot radius (and dim light to the next 30 feet). You can suppress or reestablish this light as a single action that has the concentrate trait. As long as your nimbus is active, all allies in the area of your nimbus gain a +1 status bonus to saves against fear. You gain the [[Actions/Bless Ally|Bless Ally]] action.
