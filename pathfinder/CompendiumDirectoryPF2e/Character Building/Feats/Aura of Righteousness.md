# Aura of Righteousness
## Feat 14
### [[champion]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** champion's aura; holy
* * *
Your righteous aura dampens evil's might and prevents the unholy from escaping you. You and all allies in your champion's aura gain resistance 5 to unholy spells, unholy Strikes, and other unholy effects. If a teleportation spell or effect would teleport an unholy creature out of your champion's aura, your aura attempts to counteract it, using the spell rank and DC of your devotion spells.
