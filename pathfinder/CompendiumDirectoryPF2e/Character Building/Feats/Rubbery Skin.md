# Rubbery Skin
## Feat 10
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Disturbing Defense
* * *
Your skin develops a malleable, rubbery quality. You gain resistance to bludgeoning damage equal to 2 + your number of class feats from the oozemorph archetype. You also gain resistance equal to twice that amount to extra damage from critical hits; if the resistance is greater than the extra damage, it reduces the extra damage to 0 but doesn't reduce the attack's normal damage.
