# Green Empathy
## Feat 6
### [[druid]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** leaf order
* * *
You can communicate with plants and fungi on a basic level and use Diplomacy to Make an Impression on them and to make very simple Requests of them. Non-creature plants and fungi typically can't fulfill most requests you might ask of them unless you have access to other magic such as [[Spells/Speak with Plants|Speak with Plants]].

Because of your affiliation with the leaf order, plants and fungi have a sense that you support them, so you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on your check to Make a Request of a plant or fungus using Green Empathy.
