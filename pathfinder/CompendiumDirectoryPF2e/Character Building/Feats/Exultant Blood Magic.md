# Exultant Blood Magic
## Feat 18
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Surging Blood Magic; legendary in Arcana or Religion, depending on your chosen tradition
* * *
The magic in your blood sings an exultant song of battle. You gain the [[PF2e Journals/Archetypes/master spellcasting|master spellcasting]] benefits. Increase the spell slots you gain from the bloodrager archetype feats by 1 for each spell rank. In addition, when you Cast a Spell from your repertoire and you are at least [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 2]], double the extra damage dealt by that spell from Rage instead.
