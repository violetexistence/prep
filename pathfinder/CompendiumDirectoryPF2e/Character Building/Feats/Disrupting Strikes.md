# Disrupting Strikes `pf2:1`
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Ghost Eater Dedication
* * *
You call forth vitality energy from within to help you destroy undead. Your weapon and unarmed Strikes gain the effects of a _disrupting_ property rune until the start of your next turn.

If you're 14th level or higher, your Strikes instead gain the effects of a _greater disrupting property rune_. The DC for the rune's effect is equal to your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.
