# Idol Threat `pf2:1`
## Feat 13
### [[nephilim]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Beastbrood
* * *
**Requirements** You're holding something sacred or precious to a creature, such as a relic or personal depiction of their deity or a precious personal memento.

* * *

You brandish the precious object you're holding menacingly, at once mocking it and threatening its safety. Attempt to [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] the creature whose precious item you threaten. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the Intimidation check to Demoralize, and on a success, the creature is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] for 1 round out of distraction for the object's safety and is [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] for 1 minute (or stupefied 2 on a critical success). These conditions are both in addition to the normal effects of Demoralize. The creature is then temporarily immune to any Idol Threat using that specific object for 1 day.
