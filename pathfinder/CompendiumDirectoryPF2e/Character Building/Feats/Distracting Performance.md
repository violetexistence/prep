# Distracting Performance `pf2:1`
## Feat 2
### [[general]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** expert in Performance
* * *
Your performances are especially distracting, allowing your allies to [[Actions/Sneak|Sneak]] away with ease. You [[Actions/create-a-diversion statistic=performance|create-a-diversion statistic=performance]], except you roll a Performance check instead of Deception, and the benefits of successful checks apply to an ally of your choice instead of you. The effects of a success last until the end of that ally's turn, and can end early based on the ally's actions. You don't need to be observing your ally or know where they are, but you need to know they're present to choose them.
