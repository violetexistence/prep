# Dimensional Disappearance
## Feat 10
### [[magus]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** dimensional assault focus spell; laughing shadow hybrid study
* * *
You take advantage of teleportation to better hide your position. When you cast [[Spells/Dimensional Assault|Dimensional Assault]], you're affected by an [[Spells/Invisibility|Invisibility]] spell at the end of the teleport.

You can choose not to make the Strike that is normally part of _dimensional assault_. If you do make the Strike, your _invisibility_ ends after the Strike, as normal for _invisibility_.
