# Viking Dedication
## Feat 2
### [[archetype]][[dedication]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Athletics
* * *
Vikings spend long periods of time at sea, only to leap from their boats at a moment's notice, charge through the surf, and take their enemies by storm. You gain the Additional Lore general feat for Sailing Lore and Warfare Lore.

When using your land Speed, you ignore difficult terrain from shallow water, such as in bogs or on beaches. In addition, if you roll a success on an Athletics check to Swim, you get a critical success instead.
