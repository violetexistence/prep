# Right-Hand Blood
## Feat 5
### [[gnoll]]

**Category** ancestry; 




It's said that the flesh of the right side of a hyena can heal diseases, but that the flesh of the left side is deadly and poisonous. You can deal 1 slashing damage to yourself to feed someone blood from your right side and Administer First Aid or take 2d8 untyped damage to [[Actions/Treat Disease|Treat Disease]] or [[Actions/Treat Wounds|Treat Wounds]]; in either case, you don't need a healer's toolkit, and you gain a +1 item bonus to your check. Blood from your left side causes the check to critically fail automatically.
