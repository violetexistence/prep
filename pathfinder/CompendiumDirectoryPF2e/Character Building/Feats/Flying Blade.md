# Flying Blade
## Feat 1
### [[swashbuckler]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** precise strike
* * *
You apply your flashy techniques to thrown weapons as easily as melee attacks. You apply your [[Class Features/Precise Strike|Precise Strike]] damage on ranged Strikes you make with a thrown weapon within that weapon's first range increment. The thrown weapon must be an agile or finesse weapon. This also allows you to make a thrown weapon ranged Strike for [[Actions/Confident Finisher|Confident Finisher]] and any other finisher that includes a Strike that can benefit from your precise strike.
