# Battle-Hardened Companion
## Feat 10
### [[commander]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Battle-Tested Companion
* * *
Accompanying you across countless battlefields has allowed your companion to unleash its full potential. The companion you gained with Commander's Companion is now a nimble or savage animal companion.

Your animal companion is more readily responsive to your will. During an encounter, even if you don't use the Command an Animal action, your animal companion can still use 1 action that round on your turn to Stride or Strike. If it does, it also gains a reaction it can use to respond to your tactics, but that's all the actions it gets that roundâ€”you can't Command it later.
