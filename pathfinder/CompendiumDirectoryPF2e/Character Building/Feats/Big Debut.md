# Big Debut `pf2:0`
## Feat 10
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[archetype]][[mental]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Celebrity Dedication or Gladiator Dedication
* * *
**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** You're about to roll initiative.

* * *

Now's your chance! You're a Firebrand, and the world must know it. You strike a dramatic pose, deliver a snappy quip, or reveal a shocking new costume, captivating everyone who can see you. You don't roll initiative. Instead, you voluntarily go last. Enemies who can see you must attempt a `Will check` saving throw against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. On a failure, the enemy is overcome with anticipation for what you'll do next on the battlefield and becomes [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]] ([[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 2]] on a critical failure). As your first action on your first turn, you can Interact to draw or stow an item of light Bulk as a free action; if this item is a small garment or accessory, such as a fan, a pair of gloves, or a wine glass, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus on Charisma-based skill checks until the end of your turn.
