# Blazing Wave `pf2:2`
## Feat 4
### [[fire]][[impulse]][[kineticist]][[overflow]][[primal]]

**Category** class; 




Flames flow out of you in a cascade, engulfing everyone in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area takes 2d6 fire damage with a `Reflex check` save against your class DC. A creature that critically fails its save is knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]].

* * *

**Level (+2)** The damage increases by 1d6.
