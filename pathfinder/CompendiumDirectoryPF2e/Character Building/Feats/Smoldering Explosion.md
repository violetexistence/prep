When you cast [[Spells/Fireball|Fireball]] heightened to at least 4th rank, you can modify the spell to add the following to its standard effects: Your fireball leaves behind a brief cloud of smoke in its area. While it's smoke instead of mist, this cloud otherwise has the effects of [[Spells/Mist|Mist]], except that it lasts only 1 round.
