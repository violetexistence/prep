* * *
You call on the spirit of the dragon that devoured the moon to temporarily swallow a celestial body and blind onlookers with its visage. You can cast [[Spells/Eclipse Burst|Eclipse Burst]] as a primal innate spell once per day. When you Cast the Spell, the sun or moon appears to eclipse to all creatures within 500 feet of you. For 1 round after Casting the Spell, the area is reduced to dim light.
