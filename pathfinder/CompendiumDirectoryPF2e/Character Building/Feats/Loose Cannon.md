# Loose Cannon `pf2:1`
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Alkenstar Agent Dedication
* * *
Your unpredictable gunfire often catches enemies off guard or hits unprotected areas. Make a ranged Strike with a firearm against a creature that you haven't already attacked on this turn. You gain a circumstance bonus to damage on this Strike equal to the number of weapon damage dice. The Strike gains the following failure effect.

* * *

**Failure** The firearm misfires, but it doesn't cause the other critical failure effects listed below.

**Critical Failure** The firearm misfires and also explodes. It becomes [[Conditions/Broken|Broken]], and it deals its normal weapon damage to all creatures in a 20-foot burst centered on the firearm, with a `Reflex check` against your class DC. This damage includes any from the weapon's fundamental and property runes.
