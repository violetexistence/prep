# Returning Throw `pf2:2`
## Feat 9
### [[dwarf]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You have mastered the technique of arcing a projectile so that it returns to your hand after being thrown, though this requires a moment to precisely calculate the trajectory and possible ricochets.

Make a ranged Strike with a thrown weapon. Once the Strike is complete, the weapon arcs or ricochets back to your hand. If your hands are full when the weapon returns, it falls to the ground in your space.
