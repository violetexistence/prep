# Packed with Flavor
## Feat 12
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Wandering Chef Dedication; expert in Crafting or Cooking Lore
* * *
Edible morsels you create are particularly potent and bursting with flavor. When you Craft alchemical food or magical morsels that allow a saving throw, or that grants an ability that allows a saving throw, you can change its DC to your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. When a creature consumes alchemical food, magical morsels, or potions made by you, it also gains 5 temporary Hit Points that last for 1 hour. If you're a master in Crafting, it gains 10 temporary Hit Points instead.
