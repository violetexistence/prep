## Feat 1
### [[nephilim]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You have a halo of light and goodness that sheds light with the effects of a divine [[Spells/Light|Light]] cantrip. A cantrip is heightened to a spell rank equal to half your level rounded up. You can Sustain to suppress or reestablish the halo.
