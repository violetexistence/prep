# Regurgitate Mutagen `pf2:1`
## Feat 4
### [[alchemist]][[manipulate]]

**Category** class; 




**Requirements** You are under the effects of a mutagen.

* * *

You redirect a mutagen within your body to spit a stream of stomach acid at a foe. A creature within 30 feet takes 1d6 acid damage for every 2 levels you have (0d6 acid), with a `Reflex check` save against your class DC. On a failure, the creature is also [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] (or [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]] on a critical failure). The mutagen's duration immediately ends.
