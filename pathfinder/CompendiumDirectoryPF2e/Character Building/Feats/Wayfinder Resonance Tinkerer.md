# Wayfinder Resonance Tinkerer
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Pathfinder Agent Dedication
* * *
You can use the unusual resonance of your _wayfinder_ to grant it additional effects. Choose one cantrip from the arcane, divine, occult, or primal list. You can activate your _wayfinder_ to cast that cantrip at will. As normal, this cantrip is heightened to a spell rank equal to half your level rounded up. Additionally, you can Activate your _wayfinder_ with a `pf2:1` (envision) activation to transform it into a nondescript pin or brooch to hide your affiliation with the Pathfinder Society. This transformation lasts for 1 hour.
