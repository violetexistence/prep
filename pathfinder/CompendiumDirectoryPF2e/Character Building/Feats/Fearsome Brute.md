# Fearsome Brute
## Feat 10
### [[fighter]]

**Category** class; 




Fear makes your foes weak and more vulnerable to your attacks. You gain a circumstance bonus to damage rolls for Strikes against [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened]] creatures. The bonus is equal to double the target's frightened value.

If you're a master in Intimidation, increase the bonus to triple the target's frightened value.
