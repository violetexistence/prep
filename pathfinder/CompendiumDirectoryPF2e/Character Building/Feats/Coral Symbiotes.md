# Coral Symbiotes
## Feat 1
### [[athamaru]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You've tended to your coral jewelry so well that you have formed a symbiotic relationship with it. The powerful filtration properties of this coral protect you from impurities. You gain a +1 status bonus to saving throws against poisons, and your flat check to remove persistent poison damage is DC 10 instead of DC 15, which is reduced to DC 5 if another creature uses a particularly appropriate action to help. You must submerge yourself in water once every 24 hours to hydrate your coral or you lose the bonuses granted by the symbiotes.
