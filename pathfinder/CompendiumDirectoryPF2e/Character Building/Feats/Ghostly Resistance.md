# Ghostly Resistance
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Ghost Dedication
* * *
Your ghostly form becomes innately weaker but also gains resistance to many forms of damage. Your maximum HP is reduced by your level. You gain resistance 1 to all damage except for force, vitality, and any damage done by a weapon with the ghost touch rune (or any other source that acts like a ghost touch rune). This resistance increases to 2 if the source is non-magical.

At 10th level, the resistance increases to 2, or 4 if the source is non-magical. At 16th level, the resistance increases to 3, or 5 if the source is non-magical.
