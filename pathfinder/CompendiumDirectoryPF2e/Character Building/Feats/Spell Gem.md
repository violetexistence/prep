# Spell Gem
## Feat 16
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Lich Dedication; legendary in Crafting
* * *
Inspired by the degenerate demiliches your kind sometimes devolves into, you've embedded a gem into your brow, fusing it to your necrotic flesh. This gem has been specially calibrated to hold one of the following spells: [[Spells/Repulsion|Repulsion]], [[Spells/Scrying|Scrying]], or [[Spells/Truesight|Truesight]]. You must decide which spell your gem contains when you take this feat; changing the spell requires retraining the feat. Once per day, you can drain the gem's magical energy to Cast the Spell without spending a spell slot.

At 18th level, you can heighten whichever spell you chose to 7th level. At 20th level, you can heighten whichever spell you chose to 8th level; regardless of which spell you chose, you can instead drain the gem's magical energy to cast an 8th-rank spell turning without spending a spell slot.
