# Lunging Spellstrike `pf2:2`
## Feat 10
### [[arcane]][[magus]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Spellstrike; twisting tree hybrid study
* * *
**Requirements** You're wielding a staff.

* * *

Your spell unwinds the structure of your staff to make it exceptionally long, or even separate it into shards held together by magical power.

Make a Spellstrike with a staff, with a spell that isn't a cantrip or focus spell. Increase the staff's reach by 5 feet Ã— the spell's rank.
