# Area Armor
## Feat 4
### [[guardian]]

**Category** class; 




The armor you wear protects you and shelters your allies against explosions and other large-scale assaults. While you're wearing medium or heavy armor, allies adjacent to you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Reflex saves against area effects. If you're a master in the armor, the bonus is +2 instead.
