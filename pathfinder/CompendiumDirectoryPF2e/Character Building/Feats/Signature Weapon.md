# Signature Weapon
## Feat 5
### [[yaoguai]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Your energy saturates one of your weapons; it might be one inherited or one tied to your history. Pick a weapon and give it a name; this weapon gains the unique trait. You gain access to its critical specialization effect. You can spend one action saying the name of your weapon, summoning it into your empty hand if the weapon is unattended and within 1 mile; this is an occult teleportation effect.

If your signature weapon is destroyed, you can spend three days and three nights saturating a new weapon with your energy, creating a new signature weapon.
