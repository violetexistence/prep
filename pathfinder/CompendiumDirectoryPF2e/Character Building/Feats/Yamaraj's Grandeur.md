# Yamaraj's Grandeur `pf2:2`
## Feat 17
### [[duskwalker]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per day

* * *

You have been granted a sliver of the power of the yamaraj, the magistrates of the dead who agreed to allow duskwalkers to exist at all. You exhale a blast of icy wind and ravenous insects. This is a 30-foot cone that deals 14d6 slashing + 4d6 persistent slashing damage (`Reflex check` save using your class or spell DC, whichever is higher). On a critical failure, targets also become [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]].
