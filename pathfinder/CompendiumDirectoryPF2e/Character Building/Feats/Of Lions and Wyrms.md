You starred in a war drama depicting First Emperor Taldaris's battles against the Grogrisant, a massive six-eyed lion, and Verksaris the Kingeater, a mighty dragon. To prepare for your role, you spent weeks in the wild observing and occasionally scrapping with any creature resembling Taldaris's legendary foes. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against effects from beasts and dragons.
