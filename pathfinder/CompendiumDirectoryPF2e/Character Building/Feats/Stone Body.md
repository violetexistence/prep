## Feat 16
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** stalwart defender dedication
* * *
**Requirements** You are in Tenacious Stance.

Emulating the great defenders throughout dwarven history, you close your mind to the sensation of pain, becoming as resolute as stone itself. You gain resistance 10 to all damage. This effect lasts until the end of your next turn or immediately upon being critically hit.
