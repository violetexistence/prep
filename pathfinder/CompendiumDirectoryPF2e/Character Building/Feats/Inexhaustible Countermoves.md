## Feat 20
### [[swashbuckler]]

**Category** class; 




You can react whenever a foe leaves a gap in their defenses. At the start of each enemy's turn, you gain an extra reaction you can use only during that turn to perform an [[Class Features/Opportune Riposte|Opportune Riposte]], or an [[Class Features/Reactive Strike|Reactive Strike]] if you have that reaction.
