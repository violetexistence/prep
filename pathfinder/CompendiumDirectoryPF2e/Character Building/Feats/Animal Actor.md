# Animal Actor
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Kitharodian Actor Dedication
* * *
You participated in a performance of The Leaping Lion, a play focusing on Cyricas, the animal-loving adventurer who traveled with his ape friend Mardu and remains a favorite hero among Taldan youth. You become trained in Nature and a Lore skill related to a particular type of animal commonly used in show business (such as Canine Lore, Ursine Lore, or Primate Lore); if you were already trained in either, you become an expert in that skill instead. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to all checks to Command an Animal and [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] about creatures with the animal trait. You can use your chosen animal Lore to Command an Animal of that type.
