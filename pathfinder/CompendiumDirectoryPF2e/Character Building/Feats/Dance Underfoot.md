# Dance Underfoot
## Feat 9
### [[halfling]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Step Lively
* * *
You dart under the legs of your enemies in combat. You can end a successful [[Actions/Tumble Through|Tumble Through]] action in a Large or larger enemy's space. Also, when using the Step Lively feat, you can Step into the triggering enemy's space. The enemy must have limbs or otherwise leave you enough room for this maneuver, as determined by the GM. For instance, you could share space with a giant or dragon, but not an ooze.
