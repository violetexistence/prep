# I've Had Many Jobs
## Feat 5
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[downtime]][[reincarnated]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Finding and excelling at odd jobs is child's play to one who has worked many occupations during many lives. When you attempt to [[Actions/Earn Income|Earn Income]], you function as if you were trained in the skill used. If you are at least expert in the skill used, the DC for your skill check is reduced by 2.
