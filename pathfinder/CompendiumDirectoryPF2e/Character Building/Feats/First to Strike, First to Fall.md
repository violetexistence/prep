# First to Strike, First to Fall
## Feat 17
### [[gnoll]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Whenever you successfully Strike a creature that has not acted in the first round of combat, that creature is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the end of your next turn. If that creature is reduced to 0 Hit Points before the end of your next turn, you and all allies within 30 feet of the creature become [[Conditions/Quickened|Quickened]] until the end of your next turn. You can use the extra action only to Step, Stride, or Strike.
