# Rampaging Form
## Feat 17
### [[kitsune]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Change Shape with a fox alternate form
* * *
Once per day, when you Change Shape into a fox, you can instead gain the effects of both the canine form of 5th-rank [[Spells/Animal Form|Animal Form]] and 7th-rank [[Spells/Fiery Body|Fiery Body]] for 1 minute or until you shift back, whichever comes first. You can cast [[Spells/Ignition|Ignition]] from the _fiery body_ effect even though you're in a battle form.

* * *

**Special** If you are a frozen wind kitsune, your form is ice instead of fire. This changes the immunity and damage from the _fiery body_ effect to cold, changes the weakness to fire, and changes produce flame to [[Spells/Ray of Frost|Ray of Frost]].
