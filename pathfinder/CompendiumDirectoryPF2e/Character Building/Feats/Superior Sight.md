# Superior Sight
## Feat 20
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[ranger]]

**Category** class; 




Your senses are peerless. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks, and you gain low-light vision. If you already have low-light vision, gain darkvision instead.

Furthermore, when you target an enemy, you automatically succeed at the flat check if that enemy is [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]], [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]], or [[Conditions/Undetected|Undetected]].
