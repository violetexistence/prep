## Feat 14
### [[concentrate]][[rogue]]

**Category** class; 




You distract your opponent with a few choice words or a rude gesture. Choose a target within 30 feet. It's [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] against your attacks until the end of your next turn. Depending on the way you describe your distraction, this action gains either the auditory or visual trait.
