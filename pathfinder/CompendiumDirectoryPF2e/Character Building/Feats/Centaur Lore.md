### [[centaur]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You've learned how to nurture your environment and to care for your people. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Medicine and Nature. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.

You also gain the [[Feats/Additional Lore|Additional Lore]] general feat for Centaur Lore.
