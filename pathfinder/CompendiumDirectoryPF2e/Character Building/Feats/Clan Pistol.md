# Clan Pistol
## Feat 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[dwarf]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Access** You are from Dongun Hold or Alkenstar.

* * *

Raised in the ancient halls of Dongun Hold or the surrounding region, you display your lineage with a clan pistol, rather than a clan dagger. You get one clan pistol of your clan for free, as it was given to you at birth. This replaces your clan dagger. Selling this pistol is a terrible taboo and earns you the disdain of other dwarves. You are trained with the clan pistol. In addition, when your clan pistol is visible, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus on checks to [[Actions/Gather Information|Gather Information]] or [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] when interacting with citizens of Alkenstar, Dongun Hold, or their allies.
