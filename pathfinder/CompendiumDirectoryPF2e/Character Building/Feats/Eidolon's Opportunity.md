# Eidolon's Opportunity `pf2:r`
## Feat 6
### [[eidolon]][[evolution]][[summoner]]

**Category** class; 




**Trigger** A creature within your eidolon's reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.

Your eidolon makes a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, your eidolon disrupts that action. This Strike doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike.
