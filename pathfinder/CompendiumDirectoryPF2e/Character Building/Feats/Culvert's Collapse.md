### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[monk]][[water]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Flood Stance
* * *
**Requirements** You are in Flood Stance and were damaged by an enemy since your previous turn.

Under your foes' onslaught, the water within your violent blood stirs. Your killing intent swells, your agonies marshaling your inevitable resurgence. Make a flooded river Strike against the enemy who dealt damage to you since your previous turn. That Strike deals an additional 1d8 bleed damage.
