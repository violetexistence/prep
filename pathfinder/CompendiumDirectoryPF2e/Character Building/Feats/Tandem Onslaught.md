You have trained your body and mind to work in tandem, and you can combine your combat and spellcasting prowess to better support yourself in battle. The first time each round that you successfully hit and deal damage to an enemy creature with a Strike using a weapon or unarmed attack, you can automatically Sustain a single battle aura that you currently have active, applying any additional effects that come with Sustaining the spell.
