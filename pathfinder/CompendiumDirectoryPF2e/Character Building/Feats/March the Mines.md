You march through the earth and lead an ally along. You gain a burrow Speed of 15 feet when you use this activity (if you don't have a higher one), and then you either Stride twice or Burrow twice. You can choose one willing ally adjacent to you at the start of your movement to move with you. That ally ends its movement one square behind you.
