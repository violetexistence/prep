# Storming Breath `pf2:2`
## Feat 6
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[deviant]][[magical]]

**Category** class; 




You spit out a freezing breath or sonic scream. You deal 4d6 damage, plus 1d6 damage for every level you have beyond 6th (-1d6 untyped), to all creatures in a 30-foot cone, with a `Reflex check` save.

* * *

**Awakening** Your blast powerfully batters your foes. A creature that critically fails its save is knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]].

* * *

**Awakening** The kickback of your blast helps you make a speedy escape. When you use this ability, you Fly backward 15 feet in a straight line directly opposite your blast. This movement doesn't trigger reactions based on movement.
