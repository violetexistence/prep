# Conrasu Weapon Understanding
## Feat 5
### [[conrasu]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You have come to know conrasu weapons as you know yourself. Whenever you critically hit using a [[Equipment/Composite Shortbow|Composite Shortbow]], [[Equipment/Glaive|Glaive]], [[Equipment/Longspear|Longspear]], [[Equipment/Longsword|Longsword]], [[Equipment/Shortbow|Shortbow]], [[Equipment/Spear|Spear]], or a conrasu weapon([[Equipment/Buugeng|Buugeng]]), you apply the weapon's critical specialization effect.
