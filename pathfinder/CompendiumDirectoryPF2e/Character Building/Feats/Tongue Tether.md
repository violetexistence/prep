### [[grippli]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** snaptongue tripkee
* * *
Your tongue can momentarily latch on as readily as your hands. So long as you can freely open your mouth, you do not need free hands in order to [[Actions/Disarm|Disarm]], [[Actions/Grab an Edge|Grab an Edge]], [[Actions/Reposition|Reposition]], or [[Actions/Trip|Trip]]. If you have the [[Feats/Long Tongue|Long Tongue]] feat, you can Disarm, Grab an Edge, Reposition, and Trip with your tongue at a distance that is 5 feet beyond your normal reach.
