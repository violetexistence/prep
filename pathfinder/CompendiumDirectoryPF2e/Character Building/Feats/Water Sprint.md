# Water Sprint
## Feat 7
### [[general]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** master in Athletics
* * *
Experience and training have taught you that water has just enough surface tension for a master sprinter to traverse the surface.

When you Stride in a straight line, if you move at least half your Speed over ground, you can move any amount of the remaining distance across a level body of water. If you don't end your Stride on solid ground, you fall into the water.

If you're legendary in Athletics, as long as you start on solid ground, any part of your Stride can cross the water's surface, even if you aren't moving a straight line, though you still fall into the water if you don't end your movement on solid ground.
