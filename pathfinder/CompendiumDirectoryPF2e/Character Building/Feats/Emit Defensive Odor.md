# Emit Defensive Odor `pf2:1`
## Feat 1
### [[athamaru]][[inhaled]][[poison]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per day

* * *

While athamarus' natural pheromones are typically used for communication, you have developed yours into a defense mechanism to ward off foes. You emit a thick spray of defensive pheromones at an adjacent creature, who takes 2d6 poison damage with a `Fortitude check` save against your class DC.

At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the damage increases by 1d6.
