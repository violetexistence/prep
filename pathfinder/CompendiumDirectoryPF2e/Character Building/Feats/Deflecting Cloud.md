# Deflecting Cloud `pf2:r`
## Feat 16
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Dragon Disciple Dedication; dragon wings sorcerer bloodline spell
* * *
**Frequency** once every 10 minutes

**Trigger** You are the target of a ranged attack.

**Requirements** You are aware of the attack and currently have dragon wings active.

* * *

You've mastered a defensive technique unique to the ancient dragons of Bloodsalt: beating your wings to create a billowing cloud of mist. You become momentarily [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] from the triggering attack if vision is the attacker's only precise sense. Normally this means the attacker must succeed at a `DC 11 Flat check` check to target you. You also gain a +4 circumstance bonus to AC against the triggering attack.
