# Gift of the Moon
## Feat 13
### [[beastkin]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You can share your power with others, but they can't escape the werecreature's curse as easily as you can. You can cast a 5th-rank [[Spells/Moon Frenzy|Moon Frenzy]] as a primal innate spell once per day. At 15th level, you cast a 6th-rank _moon frenzy_ instead. At 17th level, your 6th-rank _moon frenzy_ grants its standard effects, except the temporary Hit Points increase to 15 and the silver weakness increases to 15. At 20th level, you cast a 10th-rank _moon frenzy_ instead. The spell uses your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.
