## Feat 14
### [[rogue]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** master in Athletics

**Trigger** A [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] foe within your reach Stands.

You have ways of keeping your foes down. Attempt an `Athletics check` check against the triggering foe's Fortitude DC. On a success, the action is disrupted, causing the creature to remain prone. On a critical success, the creature also can't Stand until its next turn.
