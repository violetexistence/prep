# Unshakable Grit
## Feat 12
### [[gunslinger]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Grit and Tenacity
* * *
You've become hardened by conflict after everything you've faced, and you possess a certain intractable stubbornness. If the reroll granted to you by your [[Feats/Grit and Tenacity|Grit and Tenacity]] reaction is a success, you get a critical success instead; if it's a critical failure, you get a failure instead.
