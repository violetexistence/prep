# Ambersoul
## Feat 1
### [[ardande]][[lineage]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Your elemental heritage is reflected in the oils and fragrances of plants, in tree resin that fossilizes into amber, or in the gentle smell of a flower. Sticky, golden sap runs through your veins instead of blood. Each time a creature deals slashing or piercing damage to you with a melee Strike, your sap coats its weapon or unarmed attack. The creature takes a â€“1 circumstance penalty on attack rolls with that weapon or unarmed attack until the end of its turn.
