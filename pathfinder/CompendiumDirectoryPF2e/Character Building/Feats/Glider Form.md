# Glider Form `pf2:1`
## Feat 1
### [[eidolon]][[evolution]][[move]][[summoner]]

**Category** class; 




Your eidolon evolves wings, a buoyant body, or some other means to control descent.

It glides slowly toward the ground, 5 feet down and up to 25 feet forward through the air.

As long as it spends at least 1 action gliding each round and has not yet reached the ground, it remains in the air at the end of your turn.
