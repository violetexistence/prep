# Woodworker
## Feat 1
### [[ardande]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Denizens of the Plane of Wood take immense pride in the magnificent works of art they can craft from wood, and practicing your own woodcraft helps you feel a connection with your planar heritage. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Crafting. If you would automatically become trained in Crafting (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You gain the [[Feats/Specialty Crafting|Specialty Crafting]] skill feat for woodworking.
