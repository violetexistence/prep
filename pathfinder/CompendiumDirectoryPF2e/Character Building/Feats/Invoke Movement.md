# Invoke Movement `pf2:1`
## Feat 12
### [[archetype]][[morph]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Rivethun Invoker Dedication
* * *
**Requirements** You're under the effects of Enter Spirit Trance.

* * *

You manifest a form of locomotion of the spirits all around, such as the wings of an animal spirit or the watery flow of a nature spirit. Choose a movement type: burrow, climb, fly, or swim. You gain a Speed in the chosen movement type equal to your base Speed (or half your Speed if you selected burrow) for the duration of your spirit trance. If you use Invoke Movement again, you can choose a different movement type, but you lose the previous form of movement.
