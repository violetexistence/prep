The most important thing you've learned living with fear is how to overcome it. When you roll a success on a saving throw against a fear effect, you get a critical success instead. In addition, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Will saves against fear effects and a +2 circumstance bonus to your Will DC against attempts to Demoralize you.
