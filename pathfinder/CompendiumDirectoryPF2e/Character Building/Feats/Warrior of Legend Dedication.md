# Warrior of Legend Dedication
## Feat 2
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[archetype]][[class]][[dedication]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** warrior of legend
* * *
You have been given a powerful blessing of battle that is also your cursed doom. As long as you aren't wearing heavy armor or wielding a shield, spears and polearms you wield gain the parry trait. If the weapon already has the parry trait, increase the bonus when parrying to +2. In addition, you deal an additional amount of damage equal to your [[Conditions/Doomed|Doomed]] value with weapons in the spear and polearm groups. This damage is the same type as the required weapon.
