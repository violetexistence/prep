* * *
Undead creatures find it all but impossible to resist your commands. When you use [[Feats/Command Undead|Command Undead]], if the undead succeeds at its save but doesn't critically succeed, it is your minion for 1 round. If the undead fails its save, it is your minion for 10 minutes. If it critically fails, it is your minion for 24 hours.
