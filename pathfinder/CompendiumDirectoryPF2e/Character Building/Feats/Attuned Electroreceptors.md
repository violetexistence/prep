# Attuned Electroreceptors
## Feat 13
### [[athamaru]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You grow specialized organs that allow you to detect even the faintest of heartbeats. You can sense living creatures and any creature with the electricity trait as an imprecise sense with a range of 20 feet. This range doubles while you are underwater, though only in the body of water you're in.
