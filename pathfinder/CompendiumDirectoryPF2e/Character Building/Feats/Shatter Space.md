# Shatter Space
## Feat 14
### [[amp]][[psychic]]

**Category** class; 




The sheer power of your magic fractures reality. Use this amp in place of a psi cantrip's normal amp entry. The cantrip must be one that takes 2 or more actions to cast.

* * *

**Amp** You or one target of the spell are surrounded by a spiral of torn space. This is an aura, and you choose the radius of the emanation, up to 20 feet. A creature that starts its turn in the aura or enters the aura during its turn takes 1d6 slashing damage for every level of the amped psi cantrip, with a basic Reflex save against your spell DC. If the creature critically fails, the torn space throws it off balance and it falls [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]. The aura lasts until the beginning of your next turn. You can choose whether the aura affects the creature emitting it.
