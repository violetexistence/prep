# Fearsome Form
## Feat 17
### [[auditory]][[awakened-animal]]

**Category** ancestry; 




A fearsome illusion covers you, evoking the terror of the most dangerous animals. You can cast [[Spells/Mask of Terror|Mask of Terror]] as a primal innate spell once per day. You can target only yourself, and your appearance is always a monstrous version of yourself.
