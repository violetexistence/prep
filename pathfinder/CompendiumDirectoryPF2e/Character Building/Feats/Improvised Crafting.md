You've learned to repair your equipment even in challenging circumstances, making use of what you have available. You can attempt to Repair an item without a repair kit, instead improvising tools out of your gear or found items. This adds 5 minutes to the time it takes to Repair the item. You can also Repair an item while on the move without needing a stable surface. This adds 10 minutes to the times it takes to Repair the item.
