## Feat 9
### [[concentrate]][[jotunborn]][[move]][[occult]][[teleportation]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You temporarily move just beyond the threshold of the current plane, granting you concealment until the end of your next turn. You remain clearly visible while stepping outside of a plane in this way and you can't use this concealment to Hide or [[Actions/Sneak|Sneak]].
