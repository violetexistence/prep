# Fey Fellowship
## Feat 1
### [[gnome]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Your enhanced fey connection (either through your blood or via prolonged contact with their kind) affords you a warmer reception from creatures of the First World as well as tools to foil their tricks or withstand their magic. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to both Perception checks and saving throws against fey.

In addition, whenever you meet a fey creature in a social situation, you can immediately attempt a Diplomacy check to [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] on that creature rather than needing to converse for 1 minute. You take a â€“5 penalty to the check. If you fail, you can engage in 1 minute of conversation and attempt a new check at the end of that time rather than accepting the failure or critical failure result.
