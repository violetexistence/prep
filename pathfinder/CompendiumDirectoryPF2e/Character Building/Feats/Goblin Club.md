You can summon a mass of magic energy in your hand that, naturally, you use to smack those who offend you. You conjure forth a spectral bangmangi club for 1 minute, which appears in your hands, though you can give it to another creature to wield. This weapon is a _+1 striking ghost touch club_.

At 13th level, the bangmangi is a _+2 greater striking ghost touch club_.
