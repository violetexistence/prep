# Synergistic Spell `pf2:1`
## Feat 20
### [[archetype]][[spellshape]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Halcyon Spellcasting Initiate; Fulminating Synergy; legendary in Arcana; legendary in Nature
* * *
You combine your synergy and spells into a fantastic web of magic, allowing you to cast two spells at once. If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell from one of your halcyon spell slots, after that spell resolves, you can Cast another Spell as a free action. This spell must be cast from one of your halcyon spell slots and be a spell that would normally take two actions to cast.
