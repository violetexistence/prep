* * *
You believe that treating others with respect is the fastest way into their hearts, and in turn others are more likely to believe in your good intentions and write off bad first impressions as flukes. If a creature's attitude toward you becomes lower over the course of a social interaction (for example, from friendly to indifferent, or from indifferent to unfriendly), their impression of you returns to its starting level an hour after the social interaction ends. This ability has no effect if the creature you are interacting with becomes hostile.
