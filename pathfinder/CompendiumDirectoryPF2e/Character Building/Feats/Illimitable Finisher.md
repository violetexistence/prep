# Illimitable Finisher
## Feat 20
### [[finisher]][[flourish]][[swashbuckler]]

**Category** class; 




Your strikes flow endlessly. Step and attempt a single one-action finisher. This Strike gains the bravado trait, possibly replenishing your panache; if you regain panache, you can immediately attempt another finisher as part of this action, ignoring the restriction of using actions with the attack trait after a finisher.
