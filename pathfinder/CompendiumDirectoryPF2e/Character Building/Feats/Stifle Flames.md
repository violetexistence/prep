Your forestry experience helped you develop techniques for fighting wildfires. Any time you attempt a skill check to extinguish a non-magical fire, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the check. Your DC on flat checks to end persistent fire damage is reduced from 15 to 10, or from 10 to 5 after receiving especially appropriate assistance.
