# Dazzling Display `pf2:1`
## Feat 10
### [[fighter]][[ranger]][[rogue]][[swashbuckler]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** expert in Intimidation
* * *
You perform a bewildering show of prowess, such as by whirling and flashing a weapon, that unnerves foes. Attempt Intimidation checks to [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] each enemy within 30 feet. If your last action was a critical hit against an enemy or reduced an enemy to 0 Hit Points, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your Intimidation checks. Regardless of the results of your checks, each creature is then temporarily immune to Dazzling Display for 1 minute.
