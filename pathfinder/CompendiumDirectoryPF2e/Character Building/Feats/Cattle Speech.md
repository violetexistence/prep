# Cattle Speech
## Feat 1
### [[minotaur]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You can understand the lowing of cattle and similar animals as its own language. You can ask questions of, receive answers from, and use the Diplomacy skill with cattle, bison, antelopes, and other grazing mammals that travel in herds. The GM determines which other animals count for this ability.
