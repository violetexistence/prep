# Celestial Cacophony `pf2:3`
## Feat 12
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[fire]][[inventor]][[manipulate]][[sonic]][[visual]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** weapon innovation
* * *
**Access** Tian Xia origin

* * *

Your weapon contains a detonation chamber that launches fireworks, sparklers, and black powder pellets that sizzle, twist, and scatter on the ground in a cacophonous manner liable to annoy the entire Celestial Court. All creatures in a 15-foot cone extending from your innovation take 3d4 fire + 3d4 sonic damage with a `Fortitude check` save against your class DC; both the fire and sonic damage increase by 1d4 at 14th level and every 2 levels thereafter. The area affected by the cone becomes difficult terrain until the start of your next turn. Creatures moving through this area must succeed at a `Reflex check` save against your class DC or take 2d4 persistent fire damage.

**Unstable Function** You rattle your weapon violently to make it belch out even more pyrotechnics. Add the unstable trait to Celestial Cacophony. The area increases to a 30-foot cone, and all damage dice increase from d4s to d8s.
