# Fascinating Performance
## Feat 1
### [[general]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Performance
* * *
When you [[Actions/Perform|Perform]], compare your result to the Will DC of one observer. If you succeed, the target is [[Conditions/Fascinated|Fascinated]] by you for 1 round. If the observer is in a situation that demands immediate attention, such as combat, you must critically succeed to fascinate it and the Perform action gains the incapacitation trait. You must choose which creature you're trying to fascinate before you roll your check, and the target is then temporarily immune for 1 hour.

If you're an expert in Performance, you can fascinate up to four observers; if you're a master, you can fascinate up to 10 observers; and if you're legendary, you can fascinate any number of observers at the same time.
