# Death from Above `pf2:2`
## Feat 8
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Canopy Predator; expert in Athletics
* * *
**Requirements** You are standing, climbing, or balancing on a surface at least 10 feet above your target.

* * *

You leap down on your target, using their body to cushion your fall and your momentum to empower your attack. Attempt an Athletics check to [[Actions/Leap|Leap]] to a space adjacent to the target. If you land adjacent to the target, compare the `Athletics check` check result against your target's Reflex DC.

When you leap onto a creature in this way, you do not also deal damage for falling on a creature. Regardless of your result, the target is temporarily immune to your Death from Above for 1 minute.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target falls and lands [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]], reducing the falling damage you take by an amount equal to twice your level. You then can make a melee Strike against the target. The Strike gains the deadly d8 weapon property and deals an additional 1d6 bludgeoning damage. This additional damage increases to 2d6 if you are a master in Athletics, and to 3d6 if you are legendary in Athletics.

**Success** The target is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the beginning of your next turn, reducing the falling damage you take by an amount equal to your level. You can then make a melee Strike against the target, adding the deadly d8 weapon property to the attack.

**Failure** You can make a Strike against the target.

**Critical Failure** You fall prone, whether you take falling damage or not.
