# Graceful Leaper
## Feat 7
### [[archetype]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** Acrobat Dedication; Master in Acrobatics
* * *
Mass and muscle are meaningless when you propel yourself through the air; only grace and balance matter.

You can roll an Acrobatics check instead of an Athletics check when making a [[Actions/high-jump skill=acrobatics|high-jump skill=acrobatics]] or [[Actions/long-jump skill=acrobatics|long-jump skill=acrobatics]].
