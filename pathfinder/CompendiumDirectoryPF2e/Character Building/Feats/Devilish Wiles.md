# Devilish Wiles
## Feat 5
### [[nephilim]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Traditionally, fiends are exceptionally good at persuading people to do things, even when their targets know it's a bad idea. You're also rather good at it, compelling the weak and weak-willed to your bidding. You can cast [[Spells/Charm|Charm]] once per day as a 1st-rank divine innate spell.
