# Head of the Night Parade `pf2:3`
## Feat 20
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[bard]]

**Category** class; 




You remember the revelry of the Night Parade and call them to your aid in a riotous display. You Perform and cast 8th-rank [[Spells/Mad Monkeys|Mad Monkeys]] three times, except that the spell calls various apparitions such as dancing tsukumogami or drinking oni rather than monkeys. Each casting can produce a different kind of mischief. You can Sustain all three Spells each round using a single Perform action.
