# Mythic Casting `pf2:1`
## Feat 10
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[mythic]][[spellshape]]

**Category** class; 




You can infuse mythic power directly into your spells to make them exceptionally potent. Spend a Mythic Point; if the next action you use is to Cast a Spell, use mythic proficiency to determine your spell attack rolls and save DC for that spell.
