# Three Clear Breaths
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Cultivator Dedication; Constitution +2
* * *
Through your disciplined condensations and circulations of qi, you've caught a fleeting glimpse of cultivation's promise, and your health has handsomely profited along the way. You gain the [[Feats/Breath Control|Breath Control]], [[Feats/Diehard|Diehard]], and [[Feats/Fast Recovery|Fast Recovery]] feats. You must meet the prerequisites for these feats as normal. For each of these feats you already have, you can instead gain a different feat from the following list: [[Feats/Canny Acumen|Canny Acumen]], [[Feats/Fleet|Fleet]], and [[Feats/Toughness|Toughness]].
