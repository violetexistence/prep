# Quiet Allies
## Feat 2
### [[general]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** expert in Stealth
* * *
You're skilled at moving with a group. When you are [[Actions/Avoid Notice|Avoiding Notice]] and your allies [[Actions/Follow the Expert|Follow the Expert]], you and those allies can roll a single Stealth check, using the lowest modifier, instead of rolling separately. This doesn't apply for initiative rolls.
