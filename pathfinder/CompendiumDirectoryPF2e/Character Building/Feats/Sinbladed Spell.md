# Sinbladed Spell `pf2:1`
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]][[spellshape]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Runelord Dedication
* * *
**Requirements** You are holding a weapon in the polearm or spear group.

* * *

You punctuate your spellcasting with a flourish of your weapon, imparting physical force to your magic. If the next spell you cast is a non-cantrip sin or curriculum spell that affects a single target, and you either succeed on your attack roll or the target fails its saving throw against the spell, a wound in the shape of your personal rune appears on the target, dealing additional persistent bleed damage equal to the spell's rank, in addition to its regular effects.
