# Commander's Companion
## Feat 1
### [[commander]]

**Category** class; 




You gain the service of a young animal companion. You can affix your banner to your companion's saddle, barding, or a simple harness, determining the effects of your commander's banner and other abilities that use your banner from your companion's space, even if you are not currently riding your companion. A companion granted by this feat always counts as one of your squadmates and does not count against your maximum number of squadmates.

**Special** When you use Command an Animal to command the companion granted by this feat, it gains a reaction it can only use in response to your tactics. This reaction is lost if it is not used by the end of your turn.
