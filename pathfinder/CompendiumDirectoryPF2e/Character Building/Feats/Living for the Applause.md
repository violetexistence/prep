# Living for the Applause `pf2:r`
## Feat 8
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Gladiator Dedication
* * *
**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** You would be reduced to 0 Hit Points (but not immediately killed) during a combat encounter that has spectators.

* * *

Nothing can stop you as long as you have an audience cheering you on. The attention reinvigorates you and keeps you from being knocked out. You remain at 1 Hit Point, and your [[Conditions/Wounded|Wounded]] condition increases by 1.

In addition, attempt a `Performance check` check; the DC is determined by the GM but is typically the standard DC for your level or the DC to [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] on the spectators, whichever is higher. On a success, the crowd erupts in applause and cheers at your comeback, much to the dismay of your enemies. Concern for the crowd's reaction should your opponent deliver a finishing blow gives you a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the end of your next turn. On a critical success, you don't expend your daily use of Living for the Applause and can use the reaction an additional time on the same day.
