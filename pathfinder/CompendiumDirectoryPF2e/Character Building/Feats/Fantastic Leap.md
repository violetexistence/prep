# Fantastic Leap `pf2:2`
## Feat 12
### [[rogue]]

**Category** class; 




You launch yourself through the air at a foe. Attempt a [[Actions/High Jump|High Jump]] or [[Actions/Long Jump|Long Jump]]. If you attempt a High Jump, determine the height of your jump as though determining the length of a Long Jump. At the end of your jump, you can make a melee Strike.

After your Strike, you fall to the ground if you're in the air. If the distance of your fall is no more than the height of your jump, you take no damage and land upright.
