# Lingering Echoes
## Feat 9
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[reincarnated]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Not everyone is reincarnated, and you feel a strong connection with the spiritual echoes of those who didn't receive the same opportunity as you. You gain [[Spells/Talking Corpse|Talking Corpse]] as an occult innate spell that you can cast once per day. You can ask a fourth question of a corpse when you cast this spell. The corpse attempts its `Will check` save against your spell DC or your class DC, whichever is higher.
