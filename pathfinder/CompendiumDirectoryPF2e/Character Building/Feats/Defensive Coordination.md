# Defensive Coordination `pf2:1`
## Feat 6
### [[auditory]][[bard]][[concentrate]][[spellshape]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** warrior muse; Rallying Anthem
* * *
Like the storied heroes who persist in the face of overwhelming odds, you and your allies will hold the line. If your next action is to cast the [[Spells/Rallying Anthem|Rallying Anthem]] composition cantrip, you can Raise a Shield, and one ally of your choice who gains a status bonus from the spell can immediately use their reaction to Raise a Shield.
