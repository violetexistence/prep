# Become Destiny `pf2:0`
## Feat 10
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[concentrate]][[mythic]]

**Category** class; 




You defy any external force blocking your mythic purpose. Spend a Mythic Point, and remove any one condition you're afflicted with, end the ongoing effects of any one spell you're currently affected by, or free yourself from the effects of any one trap or hazard (such as a snare or bottomless pit). When freeing yourself from a hazard in this way, you immediately move to the nearest safe location adjacent to the hazard.
