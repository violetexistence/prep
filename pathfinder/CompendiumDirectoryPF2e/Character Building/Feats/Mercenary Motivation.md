* * *
A large part of being in the Mercenary League entails doing mercenary work. You spend 1 minute planning a course of action that will allow you to complete a task you've been hired or requested to do. Work with your GM to determine the circumstances of any job or task if need be, but typically, they can involve protecting a place or person, defeating a foe or enemy force, or retrieving an item. The course of action you plan must be something you believe you can accomplish.

**Active Plan** You can have only one course of action planned at a time. If you use Mercenary Motivation to plan a second course of action, you no longer receive the bonus to checks related to the first course of action.

**On the Job** Whenever you attempt a Perception check or skill check that will advance your course of action, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the check. The exact checks this bonus applies to depend on your current job and are determined by the GM.

**Finishing a Plan** When you complete the course of action you planned to do, you don't lose the bonus or other benefits until you make a different plan with Mercenary Motivation or voluntarily Dismiss the current plan.
