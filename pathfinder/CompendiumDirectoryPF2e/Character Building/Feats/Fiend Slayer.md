# Fiend Slayer `pf2:1`
## Feat 16
### [[archetype]][[death]][[void]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Wylderheart Dedication
* * *
**Requirements** Your last action was a successful Strike against a fiend that dealt damage.

* * *

Your attack tears through a fiend, possibly sending it back to where it came from. The fiend you just struck takes 80 void damage with a `Fortitude check` save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. On a critical failure, the target is also [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]]. Regardless of the results of the saving throw, the target is then temporarily immune to Fiend Slayer for 24 hours.
