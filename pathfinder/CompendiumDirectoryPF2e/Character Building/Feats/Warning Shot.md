# Warning Shot `pf2:1`
## Feat 2
### [[gunslinger]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Intimidation
* * *
**Requirements** You're wielding a loaded firearm.

* * *

Who needs words when the roar of a gun is so much more succinct? You attempt to [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] a foe by firing your weapon into the air, using the firearm's maximum range rather than the usual range of 30 feet. This check doesn't take the â€“4 circumstance penalty if the target doesn't share a language with you.
