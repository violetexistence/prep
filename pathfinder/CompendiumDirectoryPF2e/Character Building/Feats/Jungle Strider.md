# Jungle Strider
## Feat 1
### [[grippli]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You are adept at dodging roots, foliage, and other jungle obstacles. You ignore difficult terrain in forests and jungles. In addition, when you use the Acrobatics skill to [[Actions/Balance|Balance]] on narrow surfaces or uneven ground made of plant material, you aren't [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]], and when you roll a success at one of these Acrobatics checks, you get a critical success instead.
