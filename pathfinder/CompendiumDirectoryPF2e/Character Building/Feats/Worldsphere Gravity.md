**Category** class;

Though creating demiplanes usually requires lengthy rituals, you know how to establish minor planar effects in imitation of Syndara's masterpieces. If your next action is to Cast a Spell of at least 5th rank from your spell slots that affects an area, you can apply one of the following planar effects to a 20-foot burst centered within the spell's area. The effect persists for 1 minute.

**Gravitational Morass** The pull of gravity is amplified here, creating greater difficult terrain. Flying creatures that pass through the area must succeed at a Reflex save against your spell DC or fall to the ground, taking bludgeoning damage equal to half the distance fallen.

**Flowing Time** Erratic timestreams aid you within this space. A creature that starts its turn in the burst is affected by [[Spells/Haste|Haste]] on that turn.
