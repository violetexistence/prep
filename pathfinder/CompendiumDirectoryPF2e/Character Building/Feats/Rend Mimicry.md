# Rend Mimicry `pf2:1`
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]][[flourish]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Wild Mimic Dedication; you have seen a creature use Rend or have identified a creature that has Rend in combat
* * *
**Requirements** You have hit the same enemy with two consecutive melee Strikes that each dealt slashing damage.

* * *

Taking advantage of the brutal efficiency of hacking away at a target with two slashing attacks, you've mastered the art of punishing a foe caught between your slices. You deal 1d6 slashing damage to the target. This damage increases to 2d6 at 10th level and to 3d6 at 16th level.
