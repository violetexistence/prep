# Ember's Eyes
## Feat 1
### [[naari]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Your eyes blaze with inner flame. You gain low-light vision, or you gain darkvision if your ancestry already has low-light vision.

* * *

**Special** If your ancestry has neither low-light vision nor darkvision, you can take this ancestry feat a second time to gain darkvision. You can't retrain out of this feat.
