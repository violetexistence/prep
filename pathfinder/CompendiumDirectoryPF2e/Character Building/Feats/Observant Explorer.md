Thanks to the time you've spent wandering through wild and untamed environments, you've gained an intuitive sense about creatures. You sometimes notice them before they attack, or spot them nearby even if they weren't planning on attacking. You can attempt a check to notice hidden creatures attempting to Avoid Notice nearby even if you aren't actively Searching for them. You still need to meet any other requirements to notice a particular creature.
