# Stasian Charge
## Feat 8
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** In Lightning, Life
* * *
Charging a living body with electricity may seem like a bad idea, but you know better. When a creature gains temporary Hit Points from your In Lightning, Life, they gain the [[Conditions/Quickened|Quickened]] condition until the end of their next turn. They can use the extra action only for Stride and Strike actions.
