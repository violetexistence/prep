# Spectral Dagger `pf2:1`
## Feat 2
### [[archetype]][[manipulate]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** You have a hand free and aren't already wielding a spectral dagger.
* * *
By touching the splinter of finality in your neck, you conjure a [[Equipment/Spectral Dagger|Spectral Dagger]] into your hand that resembles the splinter wrapped in a crude hilt. This weapon acts like a _+1 ghost touch dagger_, and each successful Strike with it deals 1 additional spirit damage. If the attack is a critical hit, this damage increases to 1d6.

If the _spectral dagger_ ever leaves your hand, it vanishes and you must spend an action to conjure it again. If this occurs as the result of you making a ranged thrown Strike with the dagger, you resolve the attack before the weapon vanishes.

You can increase the power of your _spectral dagger_ with runes like you can other weapons, transferring the rune from a _runestone_ or other weapon by meditating over the rune as a downtime activity that takes 1 day.
