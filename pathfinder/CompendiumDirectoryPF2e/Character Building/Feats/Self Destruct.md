### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Clockwork Reanimator Dedication

**Trigger** Your reanimated clockwork companion is reduced to 0 Hit Points.

You've installed a self-destruct device within your construct companion, which you can trigger with a special device from up to 60 feet away. When you activate the device, your reanimated construct companion explodes, dealing 2d6 fire damage per level (2d6 fire) to all creatures in a 30-foot radius. Creatures caught in the blast can attempt a `Reflex check` save, with a DC equal to the higher of your class DC or spell DC.
