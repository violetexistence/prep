# Sense Holiness
## Feat 8
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[champion]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** unholy
* * *
The presence of goodness sickens you with its saccharine self-righteousness. You can sense the presence of creatures with the holy trait within 120 feet. This functions as a vague sense, similar to humans' sense of smell. A holy creature using a disguise or otherwise trying to hide its presence attempts a `Deception check` check against your Perception DC to hide its sanctification from you. If the creature succeeds at its Deception check, it is then temporarily immune to your Sense Holiness for 1 day.
