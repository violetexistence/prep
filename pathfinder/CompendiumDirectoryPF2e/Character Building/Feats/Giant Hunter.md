# Giant Hunter
## Feat 4
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[ranger]]

**Category** class; 




You have studied giants and hunt them with efficiency. When you roll initiative and can see a giant, you can [[Actions/Hunt Prey|Hunt Prey]] as a free action, designating that enemy as your prey.

You can use this free action even if you haven't identified the giant yet with Recall Knowledge. The benefit doesn't apply against giants disguised as other creatures, and the GM determines whether it applies against a creature disguised as a giant.
