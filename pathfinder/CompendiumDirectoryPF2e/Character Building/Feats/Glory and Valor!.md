You call upon your ascendant blood with a mighty cry that fills you with a revitalizing energy for 1 minute or until you critically fail a Strike, whichever comes first. For the duration, the first time each round you successfully Strike a creature of your level or higher, you regain Hit Points equal to half your level.
