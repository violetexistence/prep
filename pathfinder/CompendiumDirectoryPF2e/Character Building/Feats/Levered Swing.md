You can wrap your lash around a tree branch or railing, then pull yourself where you need to go. Choose a solid anchor point within reach of your lash. You Fly up to your Speed as you pivot around the anchor, ending in an open space where the anchor is still within reach of your lash. If you don't end your turn in a space you could stand, you fall.
