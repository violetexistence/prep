# Command Undead `pf2:1`
## Feat 4
### [[cleric]][[concentrate]][[spellshape]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** harmful font; evil alignment
* * *
You grasp the animating force within an undead creature and bend it to your will.

If the next action you use is to cast [[Spells/Harm|Harm]] targeting one undead creature, you transform the effects of that _harm_ spell.

Instead of harm's normal effects, the target becomes controlled by you if its level is equal to or lower than your level - 3. It can attempt a Will saving throw to resist being controlled by you.

If the target is already under someone else's command, the controlling creature also rolls a saving throw, and the undead uses the better result.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected and is temporarily immune for 24 hours.

**Success** The target is unaffected.

**Failure** The undead creature becomes a minion under your control. The spell gains a duration of 1 minute, but it is dismissed if you or an ally attacks the minion undead.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the duration is 1 hour.
