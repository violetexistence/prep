# Pact of the Fey Paths
## Feat 14
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[archetype]][[primal]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Pactbinder Dedication
* * *
You've sworn a pact with a powerful fey creature that longs to see the wonders of the Universe. You gain the [[Actions/Fey Jump|Fey Jump]] ability. In exchange, you can no longer see the moon or stars as the fey steals those wonders from your eyes, and you must gaze at the empty sky for at least 10 minutes each night. If you do not, the fey revokes your benefits for the next day. If you go a week without gazing, the fey revokes your benefits until you atone.
