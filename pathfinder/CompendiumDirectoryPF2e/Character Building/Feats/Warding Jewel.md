# Warding Jewel
## Feat 5
### [[occult]][[sarangay]]

**Category** ancestry; 




A life of hunting and battle has caused your head gem to attune to the waxing moon, which has manifested in the power to protect you from harm. Your head gem protects you by making your skin difficult to pierce. While you possess your head gem, you gain resistance 2 to piercing damage and resistance 1 to slashing damage. The resistance to each type of damage increases by 1 at 9th level and every 4 levels thereafter.
