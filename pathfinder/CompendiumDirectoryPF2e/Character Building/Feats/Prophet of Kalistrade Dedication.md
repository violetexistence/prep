After induction into the ranks of the Kalistocrats, you learned the skills necessary to succeed in business and rise above others by following a set of detailed strictures. Unless you take measures to hide your affiliation, anyone who has heard of the Prophets of Kalistrade will know you're one of them when they see you. You become an expert in Society and can use [[Actions/make-an-impression skill=society|make-an-impression skill=society]]{Society} instead of Diplomacy to [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] on merchants and traders.

Additionally, if you don't already cast spells from spell slots, you learn to cast spontaneous spells and gain the Cast a Spell activity.
