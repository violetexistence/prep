# Reinforced Chassis
## Feat 1
### [[automaton]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Your body is designed to be particularly resilient. Your chassis is made from reinforced armor plating that grants a +3 item bonus to AC with a Dexterity cap of +1. If you are at least 5th level, the item bonus increases to +4 and at 10th level it increases to +5. You can never wear other armor or remove your chassis; however, you still don't become [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]] from sleeping. You can etch armor runes onto your chassis.

**Enhancement** Your chassis becomes difficult to overcome. You gain the [[Actions/Chassis Deflection|Chassis Deflection]] reaction.
