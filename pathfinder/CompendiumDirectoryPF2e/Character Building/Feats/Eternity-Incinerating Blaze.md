# Eternity-Incinerating Blaze
## Feat 18
### [[exemplar]][[ikon]][[void]]

**Category** class; 




**Usage** imbued into a weapon ikon

* * *

The blaze of your divine spark is hot enough that it burns in not just the present, but the past and future as well. Whenever you score a critical hit with the imbued ikon, the target becomes [[Conditions/Doomed|Doomed 1]] or increases its doomed condition by 1. If the target's maximum dying value is reduced to 0 by this ability, it immediately dies in a flash of spiritual fire that reduces its body to ash. This effect applies even when the ikon is not empowered. The ikon also gains the following transcendence ability.

**Transcendenceâ€”**[[Actions/Burn out of Time|Burn out of Time]] `pf2:2` (spirit, transcendence, void)

[[Actions/Burn out of Time]]
