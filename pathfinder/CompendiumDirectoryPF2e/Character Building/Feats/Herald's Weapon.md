Your weapon becomes a wrathful instrument of your deity's power. Choose a weapon you are currently wielding or an unarmed attack, which is wreathed in pure spiritual energy for 1 minute. For the duration, the chosen weapon and unarmed attack deals spirit damage instead of its regular damage. In addition, the chosen weapon or unarmed attack gains the sanctified trait and deals an additional 2d4 spirit damage.
