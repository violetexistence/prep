# Spinning Stand `pf2:1`
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Clawdancer Dedication
* * *
**Requirements** You're [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]].

* * *

You flare your legs around, using the momentum to both lash out and return to a standing position. You enter talon stance if you weren't in it already, make a spinning talon Strike against an enemy in reach, and then Stand. You don't take the -2 circumstance penalty for attacking while prone, and your Stand action doesn't trigger reactions. You can spend two actions using Spinning Stand to make two spinning talon Strikes instead of one; these Strikes must be against separate targets.
