The Gravelands are full of fallen spirits seeking to move on, and you consider it your obligation to assist in that regard. You gain the ability to store spirit wisps in your body, becoming a living _spirit dwelling_ (see the [[PF2e Journals/Archetypes/Exorcist|Exorcist]] archetype). Each day during your daily preparations, your _spirit dwelling_ attracts a spirit wisp who comes to dwell inside. If your _spirit dwelling_ contains no wisps, you can spend 10 minutes in a minor ritual to cast your _spirit dwelling_ around an area and attract another wisp. Additionally, you gain a spirit wisp when a haunt or incorporeal undead creature is destroyed within 30 feet of you.

You gain the [[Actions/Spirit Sanctification|Spirit Sanctification]] action.

Every day before your daily preparations, any spirit wisps remaining within your _spirit dwelling_ from the previous day are purified and can continue along the River of Souls.
