# Evangelize `pf2:1`
## Feat 7
### [[auditory]][[general]][[linguistic]][[mental]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** master in Diplomacy; follower of a specific religion or philosophy
* * *
You point out a detail that incontrovertibly supports your faith, causing a listener's mind to whirl. Attempt a `Diplomacy check` check and compare the result to the Will DC of a single target that can hear you and understands your language; that target is then temporarily immune to Evangelize with respect to your deity or philosophy for 1 day. A creature that already agrees with you is unaffected, and at the GM's discretion, a target that genuinely changes its perspective to support your faith as a result of the argument is also otherwise unaffected.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] for 1 round.

**Success** The target is [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] for 1 round.

**Failure** The target is unaffected.
