# Draining Touch `pf2:1`
## Feat 2
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[attack]][[cold]][[deviant]][[magical]]

**Category** class; 




You reach out your arm, grasping hungrily for a source of energy. Attempt a melee Strike. If you succeed, you deal 1d8 cold damage for every 2 levels you have to the target (0d8 cold), or double damage on a critical success.

**Awakening** You drain enough energy from a creature to leave it with lingering aftereffects. Your Draining Touch also leaves a creature [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]], or [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 2]] if your attack was a critical success.

**Awakening** You can pull away not just physical energy, but a creature's spirit as well. Your Draining Touch can deal your choice of cold, spirit, or void damage, changing the cold trait to spirit or void as appropriate.
