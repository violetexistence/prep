# Channel Divine Spark `pf2:1`
## Feat 14
### [[concentrate]][[mythic]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Ascended Celestial Dedication
* * *
**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

You embrace your divine spark, unleashing your full potential. Your nimbus automatically activates (if it isn't already) and the area of your nimbus doubles; you shed bright light for 60 feet (and dim light to the next 60 feet). You can't suppress your nimbus while Channeling your Divine Spark. You gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to your level, and resistance to physical damage equal to half your level. You gain the [[Conditions/Quickened|Quickened]] condition and can use the extra action each round only for Strike and Stride actions. Each time that you damage a creature with a melee Strike, you can attempt to [[Actions/Shove|Shove]] or [[Actions/Trip|Trip]] that creature as a free action. These effects last for 1 minute.
