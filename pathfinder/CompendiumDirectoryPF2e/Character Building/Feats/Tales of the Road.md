The blessings of Isthralei connect you to the thrum of the stories that underlie all settlements. When attempting a check to [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] about a city you have visited, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus and can use an associated Lore skill (such as Nerosyan Lore) with your level as your proficiency bonus even if you're untrained.
