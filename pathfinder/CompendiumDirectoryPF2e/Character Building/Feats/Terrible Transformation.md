**Prerequisites** Ursine Avenger Form

You let out a mighty roar as part of your transformation. When you use Ursine Avenger Form, you can make an Intimidation check to [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] against each enemy within 30 feet that can see you, and you don't take a penalty to your Demoralize check if the creature doesn't understand your language.
