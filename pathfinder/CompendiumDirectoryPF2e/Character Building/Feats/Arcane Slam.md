# Arcane Slam `pf2:2`
## Feat 9
### [[automaton]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** warrior automaton
* * *
**Requirements** You have a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]].

* * *

You channel magical power from your core into your arm, empowering your attack as you attempt to slam your foe into the ground. Attempt an [[Action Macros/Athletics_ Arcane Slam|Athletics]] check against the foe's Fortitude DC. You take a –2 circumstance penalty to your check if the target is one size larger than you and a –4 circumstance penalty if it's larger than that. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your check if the target is one size smaller than you and a +4 circumstance bonus if it's smaller than that.

* * *

**Critical Success** You slam the foe down and the magical energy overwhelms it. The creature is knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]], becomes [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] for 1 round, and takes damage equal to 2d6 plus your Strength modifier. The foe is no longer [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]] by you.

**Success** You slam the foe down. The creature is knocked prone and takes damage equal to your Strength modifier. The foe is no longer grabbed or restrained by you.

**Failure** You are unable to slam the creature, but your hold on the creature remains.

**Critical Failure** The creature breaks free and is no longer grabbed or restrained by you.

**Enhancement** Your arms better channel your core's power. You no longer take penalties for attempting to slam larger foes. Your foe takes damage equal to 2d6 plus your Strength modifier on a success (or double that on a critical success).
