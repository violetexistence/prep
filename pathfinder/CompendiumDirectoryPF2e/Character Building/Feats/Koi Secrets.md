Due to their beautiful colors, ornamental koi are often found in parks and gardens where townsfolk roam. They hear the gossip and rumors that folks above the water spread. You can ask questions of, receive answers from, and use the Diplomacy skill with fish. As you are a friend of koi—who also strive to be a mighty being one day—koi (as well as carp and goldfish) have a starting attitude toward you of one step better (typically making them friendly).
