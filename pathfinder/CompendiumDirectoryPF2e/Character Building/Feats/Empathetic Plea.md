# Empathetic Plea `pf2:r`
## Feat 1
### [[auditory]][[emotion]][[gnome]][[mental]][[visual]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Diplomacy
* * *
**Trigger** You are attacked by a creature that you haven't yet acted hostile toward. You must use this reaction before the creature rolls its attack.

* * *

The way you cringe or use those puppy-dog eyes you've been practicing elicits an empathetic response in the attacker. Attempt a `Diplomacy check` check against your attacker's Will DC.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature pulls its attack, wasting its action, and can't use hostile actions against you until the beginning of its next turn.

**Success** The creature takes a -2 circumstance penalty to damage on the triggering Strike and all its Strikes against you until the beginning of its next turn. The penalty is -4 if you're an expert in Diplomacy, -6 if you're a master, and -8 if you're legendary.

**Failure** The creature's attack is unaffected, and the creature is temporarily immune to your Empathic Pleas for 24 hours.
