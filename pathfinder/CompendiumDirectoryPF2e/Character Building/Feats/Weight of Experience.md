# Weight of Experience
## Feat 1
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[reincarnated]]

**Category** ancestry; 




The experience you've accumulated over multiple lifetimes envelops you like a weighted blanket, providing comfort and bestowing confidence under pressure. You gain the trained proficiency rank in one skill of your choice and the [[Feats/Assurance|Assurance]] skill feat in that skill as a bonus feat.
