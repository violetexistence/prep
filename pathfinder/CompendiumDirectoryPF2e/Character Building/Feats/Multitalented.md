# Multitalented
## Feat 9
### [[human]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You've learned to split your focus between multiple classes with ease. You gain a 2nd-level multiclass dedication feat, even if you normally couldn't take another dedication feat until you take more feats from your current archetype.

If you have the aiuvarin versatile heritage, you don't need to meet the feat's attribute modifier prerequisites.
