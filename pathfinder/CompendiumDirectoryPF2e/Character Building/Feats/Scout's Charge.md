# Scout's Charge `pf2:2`
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]][[flourish]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Scout Dedication
* * *
You meander around unpredictably, and then ambush your opponents without warning.

Choose one enemy. Stride, [[Actions/Feint|Feint]] against that opponent, and then make a Strike against it. For your Feint, you can attempt a [[Actions/feint skill=stealth|feint skill=stealth]]{Stealth} check instead of the Deception check that's usually required, using the terrain around you to surprise your foe.
