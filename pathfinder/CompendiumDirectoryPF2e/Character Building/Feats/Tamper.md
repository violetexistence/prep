## Feat 1
### [[inventor]][[manipulate]]

**Category** class; 




You tamper with a foe's weapon or armor, using a free hand. Choose either a weapon held by an enemy in your reach or a suit of armor worn by an enemy in your reach. Attempt a Crafting check against the enemy's Reflex DC.

**Critical Success** Your tampering is incredibly effective. If you tampered with a weapon, the enemy takes a -2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls and damage rolls with that weapon. If you tampered with armor, the armor hampers the enemy's movement, making the enemy [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] and inflicting a -10-foot penalty to its Speeds. The effect lasts until the enemy Interacts to remove it, regardless of which one you used. [[Feat_Feature Effects/Effect_ Armor Tampered With (Critical Success)|Effect: Armor Tampered With (Critical Success)]] [[Feat_Feature Effects/Effect_ Weapon Tampered With (Critical Success)|Effect: Weapon Tampered With (Critical Success)]]

**Success** Your tampering is temporarily effective. As critical success, but the effect ends at the start of your next turn, even if the enemy doesn't Interact to end it. [[Feat_Feature Effects/Effect_ Armor Tampered With (Success)|Effect: Armor Tampered With (Success)]] [[Feat_Feature Effects/Effect_ Weapon Tampered With (Success)|Effect: Weapon Tampered With (Success)]]

**Critical Failure** Your tampering backfires dramatically, creating a small explosion from your own tools or gear. You take fire damage equal to your level.
