# Avenge Ally `pf2:1`
## Feat 13
### [[elf]][[fortune]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once every 10 minutes

**Requirements** You are within 30 feet of an ally with the [[Conditions/Dying|Dying]] condition.

Though you know that you will eventually outlive your companions, seeing them at death's door brings clarity to your attacks. Make a Strike. Roll twice on the attack roll and use the higher result.
