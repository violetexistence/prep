# Safe House
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Vigilante Dedication
* * *
You establish a safe house-a secure space in which to hide your secrets from the outside world.

This safe house is roughly the size of two 10-foot cubes. It's in a location you have access to, and it can be part of a larger building or structure, like a hidden room or an underground cave.

The safe house protects objects and people inside it from magical detection. This has the effects of [[Spells/Veil of Privacy|Veil of Privacy]], using your Deception modifier for the counteract DC and half your level rounded up for the counteract rank.

Setting up or moving your safe house takes a week of downtime.

The size of the safe house expands to four 10-foot cubes if you're an expert in Deception, eight cubes if you're a master, and 16 cubes if you're legendary.
