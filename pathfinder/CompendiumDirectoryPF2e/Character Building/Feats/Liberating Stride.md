# Liberating Stride
## Feat 12
### [[champion]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** liberator cause
* * *
Instead of you taking a Step at the end of your [[Actions/Liberating Step|Liberating Step]], the triggering ally can Stride up to half their Speed.

Even if you have [[Class Features/Exalted Reaction|Exalt]], only the triggering ally gains this benefit.
