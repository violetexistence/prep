# Dragon's Rage Breath `pf2:2`
## Feat 6
### [[barbarian]][[concentrate]][[rage]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** dragon instinct
* * *
**Frequency** once per 10 minutes

* * *

You breathe deeply and exhale powerful energy in a 30-foot cone, dealing 1d6 damage to each creature in the area with a `Reflex check` save against your class DC. The damage type matches your instinct's dragon breath, and this action gains the trait of your dragon instinct's tradition.
