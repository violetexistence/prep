# Halfling Luck `pf2:0`
## Feat 1
### [[fortune]][[halfling]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** You fail a skill check or saving throw.

* * *

Your happy-go-lucky nature makes it seem like misfortune avoids you, and to an extent, that might even be true. You can reroll the triggering check, but you must use the new result, even if it's worse.
