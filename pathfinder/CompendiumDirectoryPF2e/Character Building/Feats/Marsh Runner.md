# Marsh Runner
## Feat 1
### [[lizardfolk]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** You have a swim Speed
* * *
When you use the Step action, you can ignore difficult terrain caused by flooding, swamps, or quicksand. In addition, when you use the Acrobatics skill to [[Actions/Balance|Balance]] on narrow surfaces or uneven marshy ground, you aren't [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]], and if you roll a success on the Acrobatics check, you get a critical success instead.
