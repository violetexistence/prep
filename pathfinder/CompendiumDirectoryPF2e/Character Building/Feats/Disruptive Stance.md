# Disruptive Stance `pf2:1`
## Feat 10
### [[fighter]][[stance]]

**Category** class; 




The slightest distraction can provoke your wrath, and you're prepared to foil enemies' actions. As long as you are in this stance, you can use [[Actions/Reactive Strike|Reactive Strike]] when a creature within your reach uses a concentrate action, in addition to manipulate and move actions. Furthermore, you disrupt a triggering concentrate or manipulate action if your Strike hits (not only if it's a critical hit).
