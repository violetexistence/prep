# Solar Rejuvenation
## Feat 9
### [[ghoran]][[leshy]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Ghoran** - The warmth and light of the sun gives you life. If you rest outdoors for 10 minutes during the day, you regain Hit Points equal to your Constitution modifier × half your level. You gain this benefit in addition to any healing from [[Actions/Treat Wounds|Treat Wounds]].

**Leshy** - If you rest outdoors for 10 minutes during the day, you regain Hit Points equal to your Constitution modifier × half your level. You gain this benefit in addition to any healing from [[Actions/Treat Wounds|Treat Wounds]]. Leshies whose plant nourishment does not rely on photosynthesis require a similarly suitable environment. For example, fungus leshies need dark, damp environments and a pile of decaying plant matter.
