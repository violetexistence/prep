# Show-Off `pf2:0`
## Feat 8
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[archetype]][[flourish]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Acrobat Dedication
* * *
**Frequency** once per minute

**Trigger** You succeed at an Acrobatics or Athletics check deemed suitably challenging and meaningful by the GM.

* * *

As is the tradition with many Firebrands, you call your shot and look to impress with an extra bit of panache or a greater stunt. Attempt the triggering check again, using the second result. On a success, you gain the normal results of the check, plus you feel invigorated by your stunt and gain temporary Hit Points equal to your level (double your level on a critical success). You lose any remaining temporary Hit Points after 1 minute. Typically, a challenging task is one with at least a standard DC for your level, though the difficulty may be higher depending on the situation. A meaningful context is one where the action's success or failure is relevant to the pursuit of your goals.
