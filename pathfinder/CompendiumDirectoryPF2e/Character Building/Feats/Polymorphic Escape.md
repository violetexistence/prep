# Polymorphic Escape `pf2:r`
## Feat 1
### [[yaoguai]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Trigger** You would become [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]], [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]], [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]], or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]].

* * *

You polymorph into a tiny vermin, a cloud of leaves, or another shape that allows you to escape. Attempt a `DC 16 Flat check`; on a success, you ignore the triggering effect and can Step. You then return to your humanoid shape.
