# Embodiment of the Balance
## Feat 2
### [[animist]]

**Category** class; 




Your place in the balance between the forces of life and entropy expands the spells you can pull from the spirit realms. You add [[Spells/Heal|Heal]] and [[Spells/Harm|Harm]] to your apparition spell repertoire, allowing you to cast them with your apparition spellcasting.
