# Bright Lion Dedication
## Feat 2
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[archetype]][[dedication]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** member of the Bright Lions; not a worshipper of Walkena; trained in Stealth; Bright Lion Background
* * *
**Access** [[Backgrounds/Bright Lion|Bright Lion]] background

* * *

You become trained in your choice of Deception or Diplomacy and in Mzali Lore; if you were already trained, you become an expert instead. You incorporate enough worship of Walkena in your daily life to avoid suspicion. You typically don't need to [[Actions/Lie|Lie]] or [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] to pass yourself off as a worshipper of Walkena. Against careful inspection, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to Deception checks specifically to pass yourself off as a version of yourself faithful to Walkena.
