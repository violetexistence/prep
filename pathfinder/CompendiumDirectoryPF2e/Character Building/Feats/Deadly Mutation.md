# Deadly Mutation
## Feat 8
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Ostilli Host Dedication
* * *
The dart fired by your ostilli is more dangerous. The damage dice of your Spit Ambient Magic increase to d8s, and when a target critically fails its save against the ability, it also takes 1d6 persistent bleed damage. If you dealt a type of energy damage with Spit Ambient Magic (such as when dealing fire damage with Versatile Mutation), the persistent damage is damage of that type instead of bleed.
