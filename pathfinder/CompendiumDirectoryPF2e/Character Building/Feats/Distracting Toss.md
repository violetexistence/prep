# Distracting Toss `pf2:2`
## Feat 8
### [[bravado]][[flourish]][[swashbuckler]]

**Category** class; 




You toss one weapon into the air as a distraction as you throw another. Choose a creature within 30 feet and [[Actions/feint traits=bravado|feint traits=bravado]] against it; you can attempt this Feint even if the target is not within melee range, and if the target becomes [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] as a result of the Feint, this applies to your thrown weapon attacks for the duration.

Regardless of the result, you can then Interact to draw a thrown weapon and make a thrown weapon Strike against the target. If you have an open hand, you then catch the weapon you originally tossed into the air unless you critically failed at your attempt to Feint, in which case it lands on the ground at your feet.
