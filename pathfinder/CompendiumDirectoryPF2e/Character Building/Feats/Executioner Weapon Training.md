# Executioner Weapon Training
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Vigilante Dedication; Member of the Grey Gardeners
* * *
Your Gray Gardener training has made you deeply skilled with the weapons that execute with a swift chop to the neck. You become trained with the following weapons: [[Equipment/Battle Axe|Battle Axe]], [[Equipment/Falchion|Falchion]], [[Equipment/Greataxe|Greataxe]], and [[Equipment/Scimitar|Scimitar]].

Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency with a given weapon or weapons, you also gain that proficiency for these weapons.
