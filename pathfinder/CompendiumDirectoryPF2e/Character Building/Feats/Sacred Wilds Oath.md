You've sworn an oath to protect the holy places within nature and the spirits that dwell within, from ancient trees to primordial wild guardians. You can use Diplomacy to [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] on animals and to make very simple Requests of them. In most cases, wild animals will give you time to make your case. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Diplomacy checks to Make an Impression when interacting with a beast, fey, or kami. You gain the following edict.

**Edict** You must aid any animal or nature spirit in need unless it violates your other tenets or puts someone else at risk of immediate harm.
