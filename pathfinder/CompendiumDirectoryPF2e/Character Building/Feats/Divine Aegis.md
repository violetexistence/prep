# Divine Aegis `pf2:r`
## Feat 2
### [[divine]][[oracle]]

**Category** class; 




**Trigger** You attempt a saving throw against a magical effect, but you haven't rolled yet.

A barrier offers protection against other magic but leaves you exposed to divine energy. Until the beginning of your next turn, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against nondivine magical effects, but you also take a â€“1 circumstance penalty to saves against divine effects
