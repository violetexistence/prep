The Salt Breakers learned to use whatever they could during the Vidric Revolution, and they quickly mastered the art of making a rope into a useful tool in combat. You take hold of a nearby rope, throw a rope from your hand, or fire a grappling weapon at a solid surfaceâ€”and then swing up to twice your Speed. If you end your movement next to an enemy, attempt an Athletics check to [[Actions/Grapple|Grapple]] that enemy, tying them up in your rope.
