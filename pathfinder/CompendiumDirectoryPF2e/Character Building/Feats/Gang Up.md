# Gang Up
## Feat 6
### [[rogue]]

**Category** class; 




You and your allies harry an opponent in concert. You can flank an enemy if it's within reach of both of you and an allyâ€”you and your ally don't have to be on opposite sides. This benefits your allies as well as you, but only if they're flanking with you, not each other. The other requirements for flanking must still be met.
