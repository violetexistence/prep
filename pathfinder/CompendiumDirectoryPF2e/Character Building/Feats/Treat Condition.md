# Treat Condition `pf2:2`
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]][[healing]][[manipulate]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** Medic Dedication
* * *
**Requirements** You are holding healer's tools, or you are wearing them and have a hand free.

* * *

You treat an adjacent creature in an attempt to reduce the clumsy, enfeebled, or sickened condition. If a creature has multiple conditions from this list, choose one. Attempt a counteract check against the condition using your Medicine modifier as your counteract modifier and the condition's source to determine the DC. You can't treat a condition that came from an artifact or effect above 20th level unless you have Legendary Medic; even if you do, the counteract DC increases by 10. Treating a Condition that is continually applied under certain circumstances (for instance, the enfeebled condition a holy character gains from carrying a weapon with the unholy rune) has no effect as long as the circumstances continue.

**Critical Success** Reduce the condition value by 2.

**Success** Reduce the condition value by 1.

**Critical Failure** Increase the condition value by 1.
