When you came of age, you were blessed by the Mother Earth with a thickened skull, which was celebrated as an auspicious sign among your community. Your horns come together to form a bony plate that protects your head from heavy impacts. The damage die for your horns unarmed attack increases to 1d8, and it gains the concussive trait.
