# Marshall Fiendish Forces
## Feat 16
### [[mythic]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Archfiend Dedication
* * *
You have been in contact with a retinue of fiends, brokering all manner of deals so that they may eventually serve you. When you [[Actions/Manifest Realm|Manifest your Realm]], you can choose to have one such fiend come to your aid. This fiend is a common fiend of level 11 or lower, which you select when you take this feat. The fiend appears in a place of your choosing within your manifested realm and has the minion trait. They remain for as long as your realm is manifested, until they're reduced to 0 Hit Points, or until you command them to leave, at which point they immediately vanish and return to their place of origin.

At 20th level, you can choose a common fiend of level 15 or lower to appear instead when you Manifest your Realm.
