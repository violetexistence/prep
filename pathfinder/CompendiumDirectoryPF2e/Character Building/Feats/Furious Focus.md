**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Vicious Swing

You've learned to maintain your balance even when swinging furiously. When you make a [[Feats/Vicious Swing|Vicious Swing]] with a melee weapon you're wielding in two hands, it counts as one attack toward your multiple attack penalty instead of two.
