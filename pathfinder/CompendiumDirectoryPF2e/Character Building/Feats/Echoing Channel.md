# Echoing Channel `pf2:1`
## Feat 18
### [[animist]][[cleric]][[concentrate]][[spellshape]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Embodiment of Balance or Cleric
* * *
**Animist** When you channel the powers of life and death, your apparition absorbs and enhances the spiritual energy, carrying it to a nearby ally.

**Cleric** When you pull forth vitality or void energy, you also create a smaller pocket of that energy.

* * *

If the next action you use is to cast a 2-action [[Spells/Harm|Harm]] or [[Spells/Heal|Heal]] to heal or damage a single creature, choose one additional creature in range. Target that creature with a 1-action version of the same spell. This spell is the same rank as the 2-action _harm_ or _heal_ you cast and doesn't cost another spell slot.
