# Ever-Vigilant Senses
## Feat 16
### [[evolution]][[summoner]]

**Category** class; 




Your eidolon has enhanced senses. It gains a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception, and can't be flanked except by creatures that are higher level than it.

It can see [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]] creatures and objects; they appear translucent and are [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]].

When your eidolon moves within 30 feet of an illusion that can be disbelieved, the GM rolls a secret check to disbelieve it, even if your eidolon didn't spend an action to Interact.
