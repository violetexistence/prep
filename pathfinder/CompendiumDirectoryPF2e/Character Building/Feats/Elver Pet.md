# Elver Pet
## Feat 1
### [[athamaru]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Athamarus have bonded with eels more closely than any other fish. You have formed a strong connection with a young eel that serves as your pet. Typically, these eels are tended until they grow large enough to serve as a mount. You gain the [[Feats/Pet|Pet]] general feat. Instead of the normal choice of pet abilities, your eel has aquatic, [[Familiar Abilities/Fast Movement|Fast Movement]], and the [[Familiar Abilities/Damage Avoidance|Damage Avoidance]] familiar ability for Reflex saves. The aquatic ability means it gains the aquatic trait, breathes water instead of air, and has a swim Speed instead of a land Speed.

When you aren't in an aquatic environment, you can easily carry your pet eel around in a small water-filled globe that has light Bulk.
