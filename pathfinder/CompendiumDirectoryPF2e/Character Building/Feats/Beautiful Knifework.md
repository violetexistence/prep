# Beautiful Knifework
## Feat 7
### [[archetype]][[exploration]][[manipulate]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** Lepidstadt Surgeon Dedication; master in Medicine
* * *
You perform surgical adjustments to disguise a willing ally or your construct companion. This counts as preparing a disguise to Impersonate, taking 10 minutes and requiring a healer's toolkit instead of a disguise kit. The DC to see through the deception with [[Actions/Seek|Seek]] is your Medicine DC (`Perception check`) unless the disguised character's Deception DC is higher. If the target directly interacts with someone while disguised, they gain a +2 circumstance bonus to their Deception check.

You can reverse this effect with another 10-minute surgery. The disguised character can also end it as a free action when they receive any healing effect.
