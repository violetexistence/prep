# Mirror Shield `pf2:r`
## Feat 10
### [[fighter]]

**Category** class; 




**Trigger** An opponent casting a spell that targets you critically fails a spell attack roll against your AC.

**Requirements** You have a shield raised.

* * *

You reflect the spell back against its caster. Make a ranged attack against the attacker using your highest proficiency with a ranged weapon. If you can cast spells, you can choose to make a spell attack roll instead. If you succeed, your opponent takes the effects of a successful spell attack roll for their own spell (or the effects of a critical success if your attack roll was a critical success).
