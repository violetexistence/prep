# Rejoice in Solstice Storm `pf2:2`
## Feat 8
### [[concentrate]][[divine]][[exemplar]][[manipulate]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** whose cry is thunder or dancer in the seasons
* * *
**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

You hold your arms out, and the fury of the seasons comes to your jubilant embrace. A storm spirals out from you, dealing 5d8 damage (see below) to each creature in a 30-foot emanation, with a `Reflex check` save against your class DC. At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, the damage increases by 1d8.

The emanation is quartered into four non-overlapping cones, each of a different season, which must be arranged clockwise from spring, to summer, to fall, to winter. Each cone has different traits, damage type, and a different effect to a creature that critically fails its saving throw; a creature large enough to be in multiple seasons can choose which it is affected by.

*   **Spring** (electricity) Spring lightning deals electricity damage. Creatures who critically fail are left numb, becoming [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 2]] until the end of their next turn.
*   **Summer** (water) A summer monsoon deals bludgeoning damage. Creatures who critically fail are knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] by hurricane winds.
*   **Fall** (emotion, mental, wood) Falling leaves deal slashing damage. Creatures who critically fail are gripped by melancholy, becoming [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the end of their next turn.
*   **Winter** (cold) A blizzard deals cold damage. Creatures who critically fail are [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] until the end of their next turn as the cold numbs their senses.
