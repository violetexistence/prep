# Secrets of Steel
## Feat 10
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Arcana of Iron
* * *
As your prowess with weapons increases, so does the ferocity of magic you channel through those weapons. When you use [[Feats/Bespell Strikes|Bespell Strikes]], you gain access to the critical specialization effect of the chosen weapon or unarmed attacks used with Bespell Strikes. If you critically hit with an attack modified by Bespell Strikes, you deal an additional 1d8 damage of the same type as the extra damage from Bespell Strikes; this damage is added after all other calculations and is not multiplied as part of the critical hit.
