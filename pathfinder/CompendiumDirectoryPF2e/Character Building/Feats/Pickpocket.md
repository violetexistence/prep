# Pickpocket
## Feat 1
### [[general]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Thievery
* * *
You can [[Actions/Steal|Steal]] or [[Actions/Palm an Object|Palm an Object]] that's closely guarded, such as in a pocket, without taking the –5 penalty. You can't steal objects that would be extremely noticeable or time consuming to remove (like worn shoes or armor or actively wielded objects). If you're a master in Thievery, you can attempt to Steal from a creature in combat or otherwise on guard. When doing so, Stealing requires 2 actions instead of 1, and you take a –5 penalty.
