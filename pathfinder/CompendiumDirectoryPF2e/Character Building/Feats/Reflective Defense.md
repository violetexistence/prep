# Reflective Defense `pf2:r`
## Feat 1
### [[light]][[talos]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per 10 minutes

**Trigger** A creature within 30 feet of you targets you, and you can see the attacker.

**Requirements** You are in dim or bright light.

* * *

Your body's natural luster has been polished to a gleaming shine. You use this to reflect light back into your enemy's eyes, disrupting its aim and focus; it must succeed at a Reflex save against your class DC or be [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] until the end of your next turn.
