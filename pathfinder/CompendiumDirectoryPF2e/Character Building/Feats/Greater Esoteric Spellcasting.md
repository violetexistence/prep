# Greater Esoteric Spellcasting
## Feat 12
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Esoteric Spellcasting
* * *
Your understanding of magic has evolved, and so has your spellcasting. You become an expert in the spell attack modifier and spell DC statistics. Also, choose a tradition from which you can cast innate spells due to the Esoteric Spellcasting feat. You also gain a 4th-rank spell of that tradition as an innate spell you can cast once a day. At 12th level, you gain a 5th-rank spell, and at 14th level, you gain a 6th-rank spell, both of the same tradition.

* * *

**Special** You can take this feat a second time, choosing a different eligible tradition.
