# Wing Shove `pf2:1`
## Feat 8
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Winged Warrior Dedication
* * *
**Requirements** You're flanked by at least two enemies.

* * *

You spread your wings wide, pushing foes away from you. Attempt to [[Actions/Shove|Shove]] one of the flanking enemies, and then make a second Shove attempt against a different enemy that is flanking you. You don't need one hand free. The second Shove attempt has the same multiple attack penalty as the first and doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty. On a success or critical success, you can't Stride after a target, but that target is also [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the beginning of their next turn. On a critical failure, you're off-guard until the beginning of your next turn instead of falling [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]].
