# Break the Cycle
## Feat 14
### [[mythic]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Broken Chain Dedication
* * *
Sometimes people with no underlying quarrel have been fighting each other simply out of spite. You come to break that vicious cycle of hate. You gain the [[Feats/Legendary Negotiation|Legendary Negotiation]] skill feat, even if you would not normally qualify. Additionally, whenever you attempt a Diplomacy check, you may spend a Mythic Point to do so at mythic proficiency.
