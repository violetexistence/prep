**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Beast Gunner Dedication
* * *
You've unlocked the first secrets of beast guns, granting you your own pool of magical might through the amplifying power of their synergistic magic. You gain the [[PF2e Journals/Archetypes/basic spellcasting benefits|basic spellcasting benefits]]. Each time you gain a spell slot of a new rank from this archetype, add a spell of the appropriate spell rank to your repertoire, either a common spell of your chosen tradition or another spell of that tradition you've learned or discovered.
