# Primal Evolution
## Feat 4
### [[primal]][[sorcerer]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** bloodline that grants primal spells
* * *
You can call upon the creatures of the wild for aid. You gain an additional spell slot of your highest rank, which you can use only to cast [[Spells/Summon Animal|Summon Animal]] or [[Spells/Summon Plant or Fungus|Summon Plant or Fungus]]. You can cast either of these spells using that spell slot, even if it they aren't in your spell repertoire.
