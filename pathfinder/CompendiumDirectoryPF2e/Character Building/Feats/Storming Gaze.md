# Storming Gaze `pf2:2`
## Feat 5
### [[hungerseed]][[primal]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You can open or energize a notable third eye on your forehead to strike with storming power. You deal 3d4 electricity or 3d4 sonic damage in a 15-foot cone; Storming Gaze gains this trait. Each creature in the area must attempt a `Reflex check` saving throw against the higher of your class DC or spell DC. You can't use this ability again for 1d4 rounds.

At 7th level and every 2 levels thereafter, the damage increases by 1d4.
