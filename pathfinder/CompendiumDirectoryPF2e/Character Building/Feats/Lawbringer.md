# Lawbringer
## Feat 1
### [[lineage]][[nephilim]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You trace your lineage to archons, guardians of the seven-tiered mountain of Heaven and nurturers of law and virtue within mortals. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saves against emotion effects, and if you roll a success on a save against an emotion effect, you get a critical success instead.
