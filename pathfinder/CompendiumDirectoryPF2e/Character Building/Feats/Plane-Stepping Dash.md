# Plane-Stepping Dash `pf2:1`
## Feat 1
### [[jotunborn]][[occult]][[teleportation]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per day

* * *

You move with magical swiftness, treading between planar boundaries to shorten your journey. Stride once; this Stride does not trigger reactions normally triggered by movement. Once this Stride is complete, you gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speed until the start of your next turn.
