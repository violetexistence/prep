# Half-Truths
## Feat 2
### [[general]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** expert in Deception and Diplomacy
* * *
You are able to weave your words in such a way that you never use actual lies, but still mislead people to certain conclusions. You can attempt to make a [[Actions/Request|Request]] of a creature using Deception instead of Diplomacy. You can attempt to [[Actions/Lie|Lie]] to a creature using Diplomacy instead of Deception. If you fail your check to Lie, the creature realizes that you were twisting words to fool them without outright lying.
