## Feat 4
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Pistol Phenom Dedication
* * *
**Requirements** You're wielding a loaded one-handed firearm.

Your flair keeps foes' attention, as your motions with your gun draw your foes into a deadly game. As you toy with them and performatively brandish your weapon, you build their tunnel vision, leaving them trapped in a perceptual gauntlet of your own making. Attempt a `Performance check` check against the Will DC of a single target within your one-handed firearm's first range increment.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target takes a –2 status penalty to attack rolls against creatures other than you until the beginning of your next turn.

**Success** The target takes a –1 status penalty to attack rolls against creatures other than you until the beginning of your next turn.
