# Sickening Bite
## Feat 8
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Ghoul Dedication
* * *
Your saliva causes severe nausea and mild fever in the living, weakening them so that you can more easily finish them off. When you critically hit a creature with your jaws, the creature is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]]. This is a disease effect.

If you are satiated, you can end your satiation to make the target [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] on a regular hit instead.
