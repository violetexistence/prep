# Graceful Poise `pf2:1`
## Feat 16
### [[fighter]][[stance]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Double Slice
* * *
With the right positioning, your off-hand weapon can strike like a scorpion's stinger. While you are in this stance, if you make your second Strike from [[Feats/Double Slice|Double Slice]] with an agile weapon, Double Slice counts as one attack when calculating your multiple attack penalty.
