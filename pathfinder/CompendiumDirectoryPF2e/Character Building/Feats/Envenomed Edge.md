# Envenomed Edge
## Feat 13
### [[grippli]]

**Category** ancestry; 




With a combination of your poison glands and herbal concoctions, you can consistently deliver venomous attacks when you hit an enemy's weak points. When you critically hit using a Strike with a weapon or unarmed attack and deal slashing or piercing damage with that Strike, you deal an additional 1d4 persistent poison damage to your target.
