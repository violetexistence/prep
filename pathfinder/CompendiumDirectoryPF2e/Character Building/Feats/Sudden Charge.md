# Sudden Charge `pf2:2`
## Feat 1
### [[barbarian]][[fighter]][[flourish]]

**Category** class; 




With a quick sprint, you dash up to your foe and swing. Stride twice. If you end your movement within melee reach of at least one enemy, you can make a melee Strike against that enemy. You can use [[Feats/Sudden Charge|Sudden Charge]] while Burrowing, Climbing, Flying, or Swimming instead of Striding if you have the corresponding movement type.
