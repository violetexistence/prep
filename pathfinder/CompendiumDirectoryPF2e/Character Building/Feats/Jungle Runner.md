# Jungle Runner
## Feat 5
### [[vanara]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You run through the jungle as easily as you would through an open field. You ignore difficult terrain from underbrush within forests and jungles. You can always use the [[Actions/Take Cover|Take Cover]] action when you're within forest or jungle terrain to gain cover, even if you aren't adjacent to an obstacle you can Take Cover behind.
