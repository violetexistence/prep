# Robust Recovery
## Feat 2
### [[general]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** expert in Medicine
* * *
You learned folk medicine to help recover from diseases and poison, and using it diligently has made you especially resilient. When you Treat a Disease or a Poison, or someone else uses one of these actions on you, increase the circumstance bonus granted on a success to +4, and if the result of the patient's saving throw is a success, the patient gets a critical success.
