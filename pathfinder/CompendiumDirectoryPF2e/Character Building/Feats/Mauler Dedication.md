# Mauler Dedication
## Feat 2
### [[archetype]][[dedication]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Strength +2
* * *
You specialize in melee weapons that require two hands. You have familiarity with all melee weapons that require two hands to wield or have the two-hand trait. For the purposes of proficiency, you treat any of these that are martial weapons as simple weapons and any that are advanced weapons as martial weapons.

If you are at least an expert in such a weapon, you gain access to the critical specialization effect with that weapon.
