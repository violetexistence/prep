# Thaumaturge's Demesne
## Feat 12
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[arcane]][[thaumaturge]]

**Category** class; 




You have claimed an area or location as your demesne, granting you the ability to ward and protect it. When you select this feat, choose a demesne, an area of no more than 2,000 square feet. You must legitimately own the area or, if its a public area, you must lay claim to the area without anyone contesting it.

Once you've chosen your demesne, it's automatically protected by an arcane [[Spells/Peaceful Bubble|Peaceful Bubble]] spell with an unlimited duration, heightened to half your level rounded up and using your thaumaturge class DC in place of a spell DC, if necessary. Additionally, the demesne is attended by three unseen custodians, as a successful [[Spells/Phantasmal Custodians|Unseen Custodians]] ritual, and one object in the area gains an elemental sentinel, as a successful [[Spells/Elemental Sentinel|Elemental Sentinel]] ritual.
