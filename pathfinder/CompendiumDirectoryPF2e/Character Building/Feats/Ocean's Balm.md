## Feat 1
### [[healing]][[impulse]][[kineticist]][[manipulate]][[primal]][[vitality]][[water]]

**Category** class; 




A blessing of the living sea salves wounds and douses flames. Touch a willing living creature. It regains 1d8 healing HP and gains resistance 2 to fire for 1 minute. If it has persistent fire damage, it can attempt a flat check to remove it with especially appropriate help. The target is temporarily immune to healing from Ocean's Balm for 10 minutes.

**Level (+2)** The healing increases by 1d8, and the resistance increases by 1.
