# Pyrophilic Recovery
## Feat 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[leshy]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You rely on fire and extreme heat to sprout and regrow. Whenever you take fire damage, at the beginning of your next turn, you regain Hit Points equal to half your character level (minimum 1). The total number of Hit Points you recover in this way, including any adjustments that increase the effects of healing, can't exceed half the Hit Points you lost from the fire damage you took. For example, if an effect deals 15 fire Damage and you have fire resistance 5, you would take 10 fire Damage and Pyrophilic Recovery could recover at most 5 Hit Points, regardless of any other effects that increase healing. If you take fire damage more than once before your next turn, the Hit Points recovered from Pyrophilic Recovery are cumulative, though still no more than half the fire damage taken each time.
