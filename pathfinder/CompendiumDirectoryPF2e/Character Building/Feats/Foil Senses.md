# Foil Senses
## Feat 7
### [[general]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** master in Stealth

You are adept at foiling creatures' special senses and cautious enough to safeguard against them at all times. Whenever you use the [[Actions/Avoid Notice|Avoid Notice]], [[Actions/Hide|Hide]], or [[Actions/Sneak|Sneak]] actions, you are always considered to be taking precautions against special senses.
