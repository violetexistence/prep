# Water to Water `pf2:1`
## Feat 13
### [[samsaran]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You allow your body to collapse into water, then reconstitute your corporeal form elsewhere. You can cast [[Spells/Translocate|Translocate]] as an occult innate spell twice per day; the spell additionally gains the water trait. If you Cast this Spell while standing in a body of water of at least ankle depth, you don't need to perform any incantations or gestures to Cast the Spell (typically preventing reactions, such as Reactive Strike), and the spell gains the subtle trait as you simply fall into the water without so much as a splash.
