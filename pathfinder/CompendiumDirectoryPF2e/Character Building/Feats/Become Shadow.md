# Become Shadow
## Feat 4
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[mythic]]

**Category** class; 




You unleash your mythic power to shroud yourself in darkness and silence to stalk your prey. When you attempt a check to [[Actions/Hide|Hide]] or [[Actions/Sneak|Sneak]], or when you roll Stealth for initiative, you can spend a Mythic Point to become [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] and to attempt the check or roll using mythic proficiency.
