# Secrets of Shadow
## Feat 12
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Shadow Reservoir
* * *
Your shadow's voice grows ever clearer; it whispers secrets of true power to you and shields your flesh from harm. Your shadow reservoir gains an additional spell 1 rank below the highest rank spell you can cast, in addition to the spells it already contains for all the levels below that.

In addition, the tattoos generated by casting shadow spells protect your body against harmful energies. You gain void resistance equal to the highest rank of spell you can cast from spell slots; if you have void healing (or are otherwise harmed by vitality damage and not void damage), you instead gain vitality resistance in the same amount.
