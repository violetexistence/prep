# Barbarian Dedication
## Feat 2
### [[archetype]][[dedication]][[multiclass]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Strength +2; Constitution +2
* * *
You become trained in Athletics; if you were already trained in Athletics, you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You become trained in barbarian class DC.

You can use the Rage action. While raging, you take a â€“1 penalty to AC.

Choose an instinct as you would if you were a barbarian. You have that instinct for all purposes, but you don't gain any of the other abilities it grants. If that instinct has anathema, you're bound by them.
