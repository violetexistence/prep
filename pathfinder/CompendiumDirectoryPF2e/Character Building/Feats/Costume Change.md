Enough of your life has been spent performing that you've mastered the art of the quick changeâ€”especially when it comes to armor or invested items. You can remove any armor as a 3-action Interact activity. You can don light armor in 2 rounds, or in 1 minute for medium or heavy armor. You gain the [[Actions/Impromptu Investment|Impromptu Investment]] activity.
