# Teakettle Form
## Feat 1
### [[tanuki]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Your shapeshifting is advanced enough to take the form of not just creatures, but objects as well. When you Change Shape, you can assume the form of a simple tool or object of 1 Bulk or less, such as a teakettle or umbrella. When transformed into an object, you can function as that object for allies to use; for instance, turning into a crowbar so you can help an ally pry open a crate. You can speak while in object form, but you can't attack, cast spells, or move except to [[Actions/Crawl|Crawl]] (usually by hopping or flopping across the ground in an undignified manner).
