You've fiddled with knots, locks, and blacksmith's puzzles since you were a child to give your hands something to do. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Thievery (or another skill of your choice, if you're already trained in Thievery). If you roll a success on a Thievery check to Pick a Lock, you get a critical success instead.
