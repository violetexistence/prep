Your weapon whirls and darts, striking foes whenever the slightest opening or moment of weakness presents itself. You can use [[Feats/Dueling Riposte|Dueling Riposte]] even if you aren't benefiting from [[Feats/Dueling Parry|Dueling Parry]]. At the start of each of your turns, you gain an additional reaction that you can use only to make a Dueling Riposte.
