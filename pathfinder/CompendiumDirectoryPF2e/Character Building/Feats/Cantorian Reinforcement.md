# Cantorian Reinforcement
## Feat 1
### [[hobgoblin]]

**Category** ancestry; 




The life energy that helped create the first hobgoblins is particularly potent in you, protecting you from ongoing maladies. If you roll a success on a saving throw against a disease or poison, you get a critical success instead. If you have a different ability that would improve the save in this way (such as the [[Class Features/Battle Hardened|Battle Hardened]] fighter class feature), if you roll a critical failure on the save you get a failure instead.
