# Elemental Wrath
## Feat 1
### [[elf]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You are so attuned to the land that you can call forth a bolt of energy from your surroundings. When you gain this feat, select acid, cold, electricity, or fire. You can call to the land to cast the [[Spells/Acid Splash|Acid Splash]] cantrip as an innate primal spell at will, except the spell has only verbal components and deals the type of damage you chose instead of acid damage; the spell gains the trait appropriate to its damage instead of the acid trait. A cantrip is heightened to a spell rank equal to half your level rounded up.
