# Apparition's Enhancement `pf2:0`
## Feat 4
### [[animist]][[apparition]][[divine]][[spirit]]

**Category** class; 




**Frequency** once per turn

**Requirements** Your most recent action was to cast a non-cantrip spell.

Spiritual power encases your weapon or unarmed attack. Until the end of your turn, one wielded weapon or unarmed attack you have deals an extra 1d6 spirit damage and gains the divine trait, if it didn't have it already.
