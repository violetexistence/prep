# Rod of Rule
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Runelord Dedication
* * *
Your personal rune is connected more closely to your arcane bond. You gain the critical specialization effects of your arcane bonded weapon. In addition, whenever you critically hit a creature with your arcane bonded weapon, they begin to feel the pull of your sin, imposing a â€“2 circumstance penalty to saves against any of your curriculum or sin spells until the end of your next turn.
