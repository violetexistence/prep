# Sage of Scattered Leaves
## Feat 1
### [[yaksha]]

**Category** ancestry; 




The epics of your people's tragic yet proud history blaze like burning leaves in the forests of ancestral memory. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Nature and Religion. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.

You also gain the [[Feats/Additional Lore|Additional Lore]] general feat for Yaksha Lore.
