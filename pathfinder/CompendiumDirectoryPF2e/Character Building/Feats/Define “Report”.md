# Define “Report” `pf2:0`
## Feat 10
### [[archetype]][[fortune]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Venture-Gossip Archetype; master in Diplomacy
* * *
Look, getting caught in a lie is a normal part of venture-gossip life. Sometimes you have to give a sheepish smile and apologize for what you've done. When you fail a Deception check, reroll with your Diplomacy modifier. On a success, there are no hard feelings and the other person's attitude condition doesn't worsen. On a critical success, you can attempt the Deception again with no consequences.
