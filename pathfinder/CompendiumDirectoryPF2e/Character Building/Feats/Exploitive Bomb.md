# Exploitive Bomb
## Feat 16
### [[additive]][[alchemist]]

**Category** class; 




You can mix a refractile substance into an alchemical bomb to foil resistances. Choose one damage type the bomb can deal. Any damage dealt by the bomb—including initial, splash, and persistent damage—ignores an amount of that resistance equal to your level.
