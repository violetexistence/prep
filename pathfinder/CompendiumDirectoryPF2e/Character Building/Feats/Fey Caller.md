# Fey Caller
## Feat 8
### [[druid]]

**Category** class; 




You have learned some of the tricks the fey use to bend primal magic toward illusions and trickery. Add [[Spells/Illusory Disguise|Illusory Disguise]], [[Spells/Illusory Object|Illusory Object]], and [[Spells/Illusory Scene|Illusory Scene]] to your spell list, which you cast as primal spells.
