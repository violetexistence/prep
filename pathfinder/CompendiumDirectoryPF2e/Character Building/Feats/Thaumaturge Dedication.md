**Prerequisites** Charisma +2
* * *
You've uncovered basic thaumaturgy. You become trained in thaumaturge class DC. Choose an implement; you can use it to Glimpse Vulnerability, but don't gain its benefits. You also gain a few esoterica, allowing you to use esoterica actions. You become trained in your choice of Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion; if you were already trained in these, you become trained in a skill of your choice. You gain the [[Actions/Glimpse Vulnerability|Glimpse Vulnerability]] action.
