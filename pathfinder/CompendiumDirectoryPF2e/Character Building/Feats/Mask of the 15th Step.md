# Mask of the 15th Step
## Feat 14
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Razmiran Priest Dedication; master in Crafting
* * *
You have ascended to the 15th Step and stand among the greatest of Razmir's priests. You can Craft your _Razmiri mask_ out of gold or upgrade your existing mask to a gold one in the same time it takes to Craft one made of iron. A gold _Razmiri mask_ grants a +3 item bonus to Deception checks to [[Actions/Lie|Lie]] or [[Actions/Feint|Feint]], is a 14th-level item, and gains the following activation in addition to those possessed by the standard and silver masks.

* * *

**Activateâ€”Call Upon Razmir's Wrath** `pf2:2` (concentrate, manipulate, occult)

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You cry out to Razmir to reveal his fiery wrath, as he did upon the unbelievers at Melcat. You cast [[Spells/Sunburst|Sunburst]] as an 8th-rank occult spell, but for undead targets the spell has the incapacitation trait.
