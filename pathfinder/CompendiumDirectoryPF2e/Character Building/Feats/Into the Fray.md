# Into the Fray `pf2:2`
## Feat 8
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Viking Dedication
* * *
**Requirements** You are wielding a one-handed melee weapon in one hand and a shield in another hand.

* * *

You charge into battle with shield-splintering fury. You [[Actions/Leap|Leap]], Stride, or Swim. Make two melee Strikes during this movement, one with your one-handed melee weapon and one with your shield or a weapon attached to the shield (like a shield boss or shield spikes). You can make these Strikes at any points during your movement, and each must target a different enemy. Both attacks count toward your multiple attack penalty, but don't increase your penalty until you have made both attacks.
