# Sure-Footed
## Feat 10
### [[guardian]]

**Category** class; 




Even if you're knocked off balance, your armor continues to protect you. You don't take a penalty to AC from the clumsy condition if you're wearing medium or heavy armor. Your clumsy condition still applies to other Dexterity-based checks and DCs, and this benefit is negated if the armor is broken.
