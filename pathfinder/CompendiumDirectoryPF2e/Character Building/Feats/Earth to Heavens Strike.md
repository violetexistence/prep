## Feat 14
### [[mythic]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Eternal Legend Dedication
* * *
Your blows hamper both a foe's mobility and cognitive functions by focusing first on their lower extremities and then their head. Make a Strike; if you hit and deal damage, the creature is also [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] until the end of your next turn. Then, make another Strike against the same creature. If that Strike hits and deals damage, the creature is also [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] until the end of your next turn. If both Strikes hit and deal damage, the duration of both conditions increases to 1 minute. Each Strike counts toward your multiple attack penalty, but you don't increase your multiple attack penalty until after you've made both Strikes.
