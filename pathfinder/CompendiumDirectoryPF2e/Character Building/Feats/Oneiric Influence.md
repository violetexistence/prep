# Oneiric Influence
## Feat 12
### [[archetype]][[incapacitation]][[mental]][[occult]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Infiltrate Dream
* * *
While Infiltrating a Dream, you can also implant a suggestion in the target's mind. The target must attempt a `Will check` save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher, to resist your modification, which has the effects of a [[Spells/Subconscious Suggestion|Subconscious Suggestion]] spell, but even on a critical success, the target doesn't realize you were trying to control them and may not recognize your presence in the dream. The suggestion remains in the target's subconscious for 1 week or until triggered. Their memories of carrying out the suggestion are hazy and dreamlike and they may not remember doing it unless later reminded.
