# Adaptive Vision
## Feat 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[dwarf]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Access** You are from Dongun Hold or Alkenstar.

* * *

After years of using black powder weaponry in dimly lit spaces, you've become accustomed to dazzling flashes of light and sudden shifts in illumination. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against visual effects. If you roll a success on a saving throw against a visual effect, you get a critical success instead.
