## Feat 5
### [[orc]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Orc Ferocity

You're exceptionally difficult to kill. The DC of your recovery checks is equal to 9 + your dying value, or 8 + your dying value if you have the [[Feats/Toughness|Toughness]] general feat. In addition, whenever someone returns you to life using magic that would normally leave you debilitated for a week (such as [[Spells/Raise Dead|Raise Dead]] or the resurrect ritual), you don't suffer that condition.
