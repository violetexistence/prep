# Strategist Stance `pf2:1`
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]][[stance]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Marshal Dedication; trained in Society or Warfare Lore
* * *
You find the most strategic options for you and your allies. When you use this action, attempt a `Society check` or `Warfare Lore check` check. The DC is usually a standard-difficulty DC of your level, but the GM can assign a different DC based on the circumstances.

* * *

**Critical Success** Your marshal's aura increases to a 20-foot emanation, and it grants you and allies a +1 status bonus to Reflex saving throws. Once per turn, when you succeed or critically succeed at a Recall Knowledge check to gain information about an enemy creature, the target of the Recall Knowledge check becomes [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] to the next attack made against it by you or an ally in your aura.

**Success** As critical success, but your aura's size doesn't increase.

**Failure** You fail to enter the stance.

**Critical Failure** You fail to enter the stance and can't take this action again for 1 minute.
