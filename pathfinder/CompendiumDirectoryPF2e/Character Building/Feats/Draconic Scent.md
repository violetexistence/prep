# Draconic Scent
## Feat 5
### [[dragonblood]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Your sense of smell has heightened to be as keen as that of a dragon. You gain imprecise scent with a range of 30 feet. At their discretion, the GM might double this range if you're downwind from the creature or halve this range if you're upwind.
