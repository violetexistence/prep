# Telekinetic Slip `pf2:r`
## Feat 9
### [[kashrishi]][[occult]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** Your turn begins, and you're [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]].

* * *

A thin shell of telekinetic energy pushes from your skin, widening your enemy's grasp enough for you to slip free. You gain a +2 status bonus to checks to [[Actions/Escape|Escape]] from whatever has you grabbed or restrained. This bonus lasts until either you're no longer grabbed or restrained, or you fall [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]].
