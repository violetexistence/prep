# Efficient Alchemy (Paragon)
## Feat 20
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[alchemist]]

**Category** class; 




Your daily preparations are particularly efficient and plentiful. When using your infused reagents to create alchemical items during your daily preparations, you make a batch of three of a given item instead of a batch of two, or a batch of four if your field normally lets you create three of that item.

_Note: This feat is incompatible with the Alchemist class presented in Player Core 2, and is not automated as a result._
