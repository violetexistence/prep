# Apparition Cloud `pf2:r`
## Feat 12
### [[animist]][[misfortune]][[wandering]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Spirit Familiar
* * *
**Trigger** You are targeted by an attack.

**Requirements** Your familiar is adjacent to you or in your space.

* * *

With a mere thought, you discorporate your familiar into a thousand shards of spiritual magic, protecting both it and yourself from physical harm while making it difficult for enemies to move near you. You are [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] from the triggering attack. Until the start of your next turn, your familiar can't be targeted and your enemies treat all spaces adjacent to you as difficult terrain.
