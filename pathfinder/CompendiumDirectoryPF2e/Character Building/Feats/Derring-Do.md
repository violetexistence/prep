# Derring-Do
## Feat 10
### [[fortune]][[swashbuckler]]

**Category** class; 




When you compound panache with even more derring-do, it somehow tends to work out. When you already have [[Class Features/Panache|Panache]], you can roll twice and use the higher result on checks to which the circumstance bonus from [[Class Features/Stylish Combatant|Stylish Combatant]] applies ([[Actions/Tumble Through|Tumble Through]] and any skill actions with the bravado trait).
