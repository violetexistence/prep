# Apparition Sense
## Feat 1
### [[animist]][[divine]]

**Category** class; 




You can see and interact with things others can't. You have apparition sight, an imprecise sense that allows you to detect the presence of [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]] or [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] spirits, haunts, and undead within 30 feet of you.

You can allow a spirit or undead otherwise incapable of speech to speak through you as long as you are in direct contact with it. As an activity that takes 10 minutes, you can act as a link between disembodied souls and their mortal bodies. As long as you are in contact with both a spirit and a living body that belonged to it in life during that entire time, the spirit can use you to return to that body; this does not allow you to bring the dead back to life, but can assist in restoring a disembodied soul to a still-living body. If the body is occupied by another spirit or soul, that entity must succeed at a Will save against your spell DC or be cast from the body when its original owner is returned.
