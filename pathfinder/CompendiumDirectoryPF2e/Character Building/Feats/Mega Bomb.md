# Mega Bomb
## Feat 20
### [[additive]][[alchemist]][[manipulate]]

**Category** class; 




You can add a highly explosive additive to an alchemical bomb to turn it into a mega bomb. Throwing this bomb takes a 2-action activity instead of a Strike. This isn't a Strike, and you don't make an attack roll. The mega bomb explodes in a 30-foot burst within 60 feet. It deals damage as if each creature were the primary target, with a `Reflex check` save. On a failed save, a creature also takes any extra effects that affect a primary target (such as [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] from bottled lightning). Though all targets in the area take splash damage as primary targets, there is no further splash beyond that area.
