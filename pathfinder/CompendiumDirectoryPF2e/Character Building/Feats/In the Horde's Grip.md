# In the Horde's Grip `pf2:1`
## Feat 14
### [[archetype]][[concentrate]][[flourish]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Grasping Corpses
* * *
When your skeletons and zombies attack, their skeletal claws and rotting hands clutch and tear flesh. Weaker foes are caught in their grip. You command your horde to perform a [[Actions/Mobbing Assault|Mobbing Assault]]. Instead of being [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]], a creature who takes physical damage from failing the saving throw is [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] by your horde ([[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]] on a critical failure). The DC to [[Actions/Escape|Escape]] from your horde is equal to your spell DC. Creatures grabbed by your horde that fail a saving throw against the horde's Mobbing Assault take 2d6 persistent bleed damage.
