# Venipuncture `pf2:2`
## Feat 10
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Sanguimancer Dedication
* * *
**Cost** all your remaining sanguimancy Hit Points (minimum 3)

* * *

A shell made up of hundreds of razor-thin needles of blood forms around you before exploding outward, lacerating foes in a 30-foot emanation. The needles deal piercing damage equal to double the number of sanguimancy Hit Points you spent, to a maximum of 80 damage. Creatures caught in the blast must attempt a `Reflex check` save. The DC for this save is your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.
