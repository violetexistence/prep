# This Time, Bring the Body
## Feat 17
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[reincarnated]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Death sends a soul into the River of Souls. Since your soul has experienced not only death but also rebirth, you can shift your physical body into the Ethereal Plane for brief intervals. You gain [[Spells/Ethereal Jaunt|Ethereal Jaunt]] as a 9th-rank occult innate spell that you can cast once per day. Thanks to your soul's intimate connection with the Ethereal Plane, you can move at your normal speed while this spell is in effect.
