# Eternal Legend Dedication
## Feat 12
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[destiny]][[mythic]]

**Category** class; 




As your renown as a fighter grows, your Calling comes to fruition. Almost nothing can keep you down. During your daily preparations, choose [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy]], [[Conditions/Drained|Drained]], or [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled]]. For the remainder of the day, when you roll a success against an effect that would impose that condition on you, you get a critical success instead. In addition, anytime you gain the chosen condition, reduce its value by 1. You can change the chosen condition with a single action that has the concentrate trait.
