# Elemental Transformation `pf2:1`
## Feat 10
### [[kineticist]][[polymorph]][[primal]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** exactly one kinetic element
* * *
**Frequency** once per day

**Requirements** Your kinetic gate is deactivated.

* * *

You open your kinetic gate, but rather than activating your kinetic aura, you instead become overwhelmed with transformative elemental energy. You're affected by an [[Spells/Elemental Form|Elemental Form]] spell with the same trait as your kinetic element. You can heighten it to any spell rank up to half your level rounded up.
