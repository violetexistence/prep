# Faithful Stride `pf2:2`
## Feat 8
### [[champion]][[magical]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Faithful Steed
* * *
**Requirements** You are riding your mount.

* * *

Confident in your faith, you Command an Animal to order your mount to Stride up to twice its Speed (or up to three times its Speed if you used 3 actions for Faithful Stride). During this movement, your mount can Stride across liquid and other surfaces that don't support its weight. If your mount ends its movement on a surface that can't support it, your mount (and you) fall in or it collapses as normal.
