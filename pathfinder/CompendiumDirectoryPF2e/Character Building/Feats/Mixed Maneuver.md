## Feat 8
### [[monk]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** master in Athletics
* * *
You leverage your knowledge of martial arts to mix different maneuvers together into a single flowing combination. Choose any two of [[Actions/Grapple|Grapple]], [[Actions/Reposition|Reposition]], [[Actions/Shove|Shove]], and [[Actions/Trip|Trip]]. Attempt both of the attacks you chose against the same or different creatures, but don't apply the multiple attack penalty until after resolving both attacks.
