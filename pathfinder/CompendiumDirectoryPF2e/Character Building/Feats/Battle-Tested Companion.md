# Battle-Tested Companion
## Feat 6
### [[commander]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Commander's Companion
* * *
Your companion is a tried and tested ally of unshakable reliability. The companion you gained with Commander's Companion is now a mature animal companion. While your banner is affixed to this companion, the banner's aura is 10 feet greater than it normally is (typically this means the banner's 30-foot aura becomes a 40-foot aura).
