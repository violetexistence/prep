# Sanguimancer Dedication
## Feat 2
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[dedication]][[archetype]]

**Category** class; 




The life essence in your blood recovers naturally over time. You gain a special type of temporary Hit Points called sanguimancy Hit Points that follow the normal rules for temporary Hit Points with two exceptions: you can spend them to power some sanguimancy feats, and you can never have a greater number of sanguimancy Hit Points than double your level.

After a full 8-hour rest, you gain sanguimancy HP equal to your level that last for 8 hours. If someone successfully restores HP to you with [[Actions/Treat Wounds|Treat Wounds]], you also gain 1 sanguimancy HP for every 10 Hit Points recovered (minimum 1 sanguimancy HP).

**Special** Sanguimancer actions have the trait matching your spellcasting tradition; if you don't have one, choose divine or occult when you select the Sanguimancer Dedication.
