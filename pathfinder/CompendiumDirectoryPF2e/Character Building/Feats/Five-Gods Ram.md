# Five-Gods Ram `pf2:3`
## Feat 12
### [[monk]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Rushing Goat Stance
* * *
**Requirements** You're in [[Feats/Rushing Goat Stance|Rushing Goat Stance]].

* * *

You attack in an unceasing flurry of charging headbutts. Stride or Climb and then make a ramming horn Strike. If the Strike is successful, you immediately push the target back 10 feet, then Stride or Climb and make a second ramming horn Strike against them. If the second Strike is successful, you immediately knock the target [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]], but if the second Strike is a failure or if you're unable to complete all the required actions, you become [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]].

Both Strikes count toward your multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until you've made both of them.
