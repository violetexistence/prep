# Underwater Volcano
## Feat 17
### [[azarketi]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You can cast [[Spells/Volcanic Eruption|Volcanic Eruption]] as a 7th-rank primal innate spell once per day, except that you can only evoke the volcano on the floor of a body of water, and the effects that normally happen to flying creatures happen to swimming creatures instead.
