You gain the [[PF2e Journals/Archetypes/Basic Spellcasting Feat|Basic Spellcasting Feat]] benefits. Each time you gain a spell slot of a new level from the sorcerer archetype, add a spell of the appropriate spell rank to your repertoire: a common spell of your bloodline's tradition, one of your bloodline's granted spells, or another spell you have learned or discovered.
