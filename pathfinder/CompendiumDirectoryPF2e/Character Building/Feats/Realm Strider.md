# Realm Strider
## Feat 16
### [[mythic]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Archfiend Dedication
* * *
You can teleport across the battlefield, disappearing and appearing in a burst of hellfire and brimstone, a flash of lightning, a cloud of caustic gas, or other environmental hazard common within your planned realm. You can cast [[Spells/Translocate|Translocate]] as a 4th-rank divine innate spell at will. When you do, spaces adjacent to the one you leave from and the one you appear in are momentarily filled with a damaging energy common to your realm, dealing 4d6 damage of your realm's damage type to creatures in the affected spaces (`Reflex check` save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher).
