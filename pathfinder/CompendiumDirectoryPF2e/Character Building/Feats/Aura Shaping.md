# Aura Shaping
## Feat 10
### [[kineticist]]

**Category** class; 




You control the size of your kinetic aura. You can make your kinetic aura's emanation any size from a 5-foot emanation to a 20-foot emanation (you must choose a multiple of 5). You choose the size when you Channel Elements and can change it when you use a stance impulse that affects your kinetic aura. Increase the maximum size you can choose by 5 feet at 15th and 20th levels.
