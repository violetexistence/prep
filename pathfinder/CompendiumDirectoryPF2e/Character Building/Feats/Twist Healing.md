# Twist Healing
## Feat 17
### [[dhampir]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** ability to cast heal and harm
* * *
Your connection to both life and undeath lets you twist the healing power of magic items to suit your own needs and aims. Whenever you Activate an Item to cast a [[Spells/Heal|Heal]] spell, you can invert its energy to produce the effects of an equivalent [[Spells/Harm|Harm]] spell instead.
