# Guarded Thoughts
## Feat 9
### [[nagaji]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Your mind, like a dark naga's, foils attempts to read your thoughts. Any effect that specifically attempts to read your mind to glean information must succeed at a counteract check against the higher of your class DC or your spell DC to do so successfully; otherwise, it gains no information. The counteract rank is equal to half your level rounded up.
