# Angelkin
## Feat 1
### [[lineage]][[nephilim]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You descend from an angel, a winged messenger from Nirvana or one of the other celestial realms. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Society. If you would automatically become trained in Society (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You know the Empyrean language, and you gain the [[Feats/Multilingual|Multilingual]] skill feat.
