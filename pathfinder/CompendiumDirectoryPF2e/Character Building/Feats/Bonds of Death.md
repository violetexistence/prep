# Bonds of Death `pf2:0`
## Feat 8
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Reanimator Dedication
* * *
**Frequency** once per day

**Requirements** You have cast [[Spells/Summon Undead|Summon Undead]] this turn.

* * *

You sway with the motions of your spells that animate the dead, channeling your power to sustain two at the same time. You Sustain your previous casting of animate dead, binding the necromantic energy of the two spells together with metaphysical twine. On subsequent rounds, you can Sustain both animate dead spells with a single action to Sustain the Spell. This benefit lasts until either of the spells ends.
