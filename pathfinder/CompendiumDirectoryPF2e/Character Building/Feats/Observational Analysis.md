# Observational Analysis
## Feat 4
### [[commander]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Combat Assessment
* * *
You are able to rapidly discern relevant details about your opponents in the heat of combat. When you use Combat Assessment against a target that you or an ally has targeted with a Strike or spell since the start of your last turn, you get a +2 circumstance bonus to the [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] check (+4 if the Strike from Combat Assessment is a critical hit.)
