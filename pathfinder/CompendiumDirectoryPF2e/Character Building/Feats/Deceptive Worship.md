# Deceptive Worship
## Feat 1
### [[general]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Occultism
* * *
Members of your cult frequently pass themselves off as worshippers of other religions. You can use Occultism instead of Deception to [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] a typical worshipper of another faith or to [[Actions/Lie|Lie]] specifically to claim you are a member of the faith you are Impersonating. You still need to use the Deception skill to Impersonate a specific worshipper or to perform other deceptive actions, such as attempting to Lie about any other matter.
