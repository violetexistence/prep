# Collapse `pf2:r`
## Feat 1
### [[skeleton]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per 10 minutes

**Trigger** An enemy's Strike against you is a critical hit.

* * *

You collapse into a pile of bones, mitigating the worst of the damage you would have taken, and the triggering attack deals only the amount it would deal on a hit (typically full damage instead of double damage). Any other effects caused by a critical hit still occur. While collapsed, you're [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] and can't act except to Stand, which re-forms you into a skeleton in a standing position.
