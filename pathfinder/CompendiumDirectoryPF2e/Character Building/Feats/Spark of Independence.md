# Spark of Independence `pf2:2`
## Feat 5
### [[poppet]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You touch a creature with the minion trait and share the heightened sense of autonomy you've discovered. The minion is [[Conditions/Quickened|Quickened]] for 1 round and is then temporarily immune for 10 minutes. It can use this extra action to Step, Stride, or Strike.
