# Consume Spell
## Feat 14
### [[sorcerer]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Counterspell
* * *
When you successfully [[Feats/Counterspell (Spontaneous)|Counterspell]] a spell of the tradition that matches your bloodline, you consume it, replenishing yourself with its energy.

When you do, you are nourished as if you had eaten a meal and regain Hit Points equal to twice the level of the counteracted spell.
