# Heaven's Step Offense `pf2:r`
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Kitharodian Actor Dedication
* * *
**Trigger** Your melee Strike reduces a creature to 0 Hit Points

* * *

Your lessons from the stage find life in the storied mercy and fearlessness of Grand Prince Gennaris III. With a theatrical flourish, the Strike becomes nonlethal, and you can Stride up to half your Speed in a straight line toward another enemy. This attention-arresting movement does not provoke reactions from enemies unless they are immune to mental effects.
