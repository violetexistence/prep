# Stone Blood
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Ka Stone Ritual
* * *
You can selectively stop your bleeding with ease. Reduce the DC of flat checks to stop persistent bleed damage you have from 15 to 10, and you can use a single action that has the concentrate trait to gain an early flat check without physically binding the wounds. You recover naturally from the [[Conditions/Drained|Drained]] condition twice as quickly as normal.
