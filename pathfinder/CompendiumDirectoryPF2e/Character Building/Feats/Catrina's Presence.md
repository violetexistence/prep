# Catrina's Presence
## Feat 9
### [[duskwalker]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You've adopted the calming presence of catrinas, the festive dead; you might have even danced with a catrina yourself! So long as you are visibly carrying fresh flowers or colorful ribbons somewhere on your person, you can cast [[Spells/Calm|Calm]] twice per day as a 2nd-rank divine innate spell.
