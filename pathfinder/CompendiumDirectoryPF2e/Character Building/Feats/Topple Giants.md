# Topple Giants
## Feat 8
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Overwatch Dedication
* * *
When you observe an ally try and fail to execute a strategic maneuver against your enemies, you coordinate with your other allies to finish the job, using the opening from the first attempt to keep your foe off-balance and ensure your eventual success.

When an ally within your overwatch field attempts to [[Actions/Disarm|Disarm]], [[Actions/Shove|Shove]], or [[Actions/Trip|Trip]] an opponent within your overwatch field and fails, you coordinate efforts to provide a +2 circumstance bonus to the next Athletics check rolled by a different ally to attempt the same action on the same target before that target's next turn.
