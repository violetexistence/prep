# Radiant Armament
## Feat 10
### [[champion]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** blessed armament
* * *
Your blessed armament radiates power, further enhancing your chosen weapon. When you choose the weapon for your blessed armament during your daily preparations, add the [[Equipment/Astral|Astral]] and [[Equipment/Brilliant|Brilliant]] property runes to the list of effects you can choose from. If you're holy, also add the [[Equipment/Holy|Holy]] rune, and if you're unholy, also add the [[Equipment/Unholy|Unholy]] rune.

In addition, you can change the rune you've selected for the day to a different rune from your list as a 10-minute activity that has the concentrate, divine, and exploration traits. Changing the rune doesn't restore abilities that can be used only a limited number of times, such as Holy Healing for the _holy_ rune
