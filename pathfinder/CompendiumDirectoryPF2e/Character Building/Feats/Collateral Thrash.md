# Collateral Thrash
## Feat 16
### [[barbarian]][[rage]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Thrash
* * *
You smack the foe you're thrashing into someone else. When you Thrash, choose another enemy adjacent to the [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] enemy. That enemy also takes your Thrash damage, with a `Reflex check` save against your class DC.
