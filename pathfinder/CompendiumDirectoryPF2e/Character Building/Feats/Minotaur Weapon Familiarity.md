# Minotaur Weapon Familiarity
## Feat 1
### [[minotaur]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Your elders taught you to wield weapons that can split skulls and smash through shields. You have familiarity with the battle axe, falchion, glaive, and greataxeâ€”for the purposes of proficiency, you treat these martial weapons as simple weapons.

At 5th level, whenever you get a critical hit with one of these weapons, you get its critical specialization effect.
