# Certain Stratagem
## Feat 2
### [[investigator]]

**Category** class; 




You know exactly where to strike a foe to target their weak spots. When you make a Strike that you're adding your Intelligence modifier to due to [[Actions/Devise a Stratagem|Devising a Stratagem]] and miss, you deal half of your [[Class Features/Strategic Strike|Strategic Strike]] damage to the target. This damage type is that of the weapon or unarmed attack you used for the Strike.
