**Prerequisites** Mind Smith Dedication
* * *
You focus your mind on thoughtforms of fundamental magical forces, shaping them into a property rune that you mentally etch onto your mind weapon. During your daily preparations, choose one rune from the following list of weapon property runes: _corrosive_, _vitalizing_, _flaming_, _frost_, _shock_, and _thundering_. You enhance your weapon with the chosen rune until your next daily preparations. This rune counts toward your maximum limit of runes as normal.
