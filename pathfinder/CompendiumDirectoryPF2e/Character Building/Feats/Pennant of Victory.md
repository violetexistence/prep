You wave your banner in victory, signaling to your allies that the fight is won. You and all allies within the aura of your commander's banner gain a +4 status bonus to attack and damage rolls, a +10-foot status bonus to all your Speeds, and 40 temporary Hit Points. These benefits last until the start of your next turn.
