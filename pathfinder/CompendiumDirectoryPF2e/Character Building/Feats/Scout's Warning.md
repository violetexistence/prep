You visually or audibly warn your allies of danger, granting them each a +1 circumstance bonus to their initiative rolls, or a +2 circumstance bonus if you're using the [[Actions/Scout|Scout]] exploration activity. Depending on whether you use gestures or call out, this action gains either the visual or the auditory trait, respectively.
