# Centaur Weapon Familiarity
## Feat 1
### [[centaur]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You've trained in the weapons favored by your people, becoming a skilled archer and jouster. You have familiarity with the lance, longbow, longspear, shortbow, and spearâ€”for the purposes of proficiency, you treat any of these that are martial weapons as simple weapons.

At 5th level, whenever you get a critical hit with one of these weapons, you get its critical specialization effect.
