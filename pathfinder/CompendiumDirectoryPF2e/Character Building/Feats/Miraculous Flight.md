# Miraculous Flight
## Feat 18
### [[archetype]][[magical]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Vehicle Mechanic Dedication
* * *
With superior engineering and magical application, you have freed your signature vehicle from the bonds of gravity, allowing it to soar through the sky like a dragon. The vehicle gains magical propulsion and a fly Speed equal to its fastest current Speed. If your signature vehicle already had a fly Speed, reduce the distance the vehicle needs to make a 90-degree turn to half the usual length (typically half the length of the vehicle).
