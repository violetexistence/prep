You declare a creature you are aware of within 30 feet anathema, causing their friends and strangers to shy away from them. Attempt a `DC 5 Religion check` or the action is disrupted. This curse remains until removed by [[Spells/Cleanse Affliction|Cleanse Affliction]] or a similar effect, or an atone ritual. In addition, the creature gains weakness 10 to spirit damage for 1 minute.
