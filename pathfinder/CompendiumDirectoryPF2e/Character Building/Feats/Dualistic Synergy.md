If your next action is to Cast a Spell from your spell slots, you gain a benefit. If the spell is arcane, you can attempt a skill check to [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] with a +1 status bonus to the check after casting the spell, or a +2 status bonus if the spell is 7th rank or higher. If the spell is primal, you gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to the spell's rank for 1 round. If the spell is a halcyon spell, you gain both benefits.
