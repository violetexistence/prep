# Fresh Ingredients
## Feat 2
### [[archetype]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** Herbalist Dedication
* * *
It is amazing the difference fresh herbs can make. When using [[Feats/Natural Medicine|Natural Medicine]] to [[Actions/Treat Wounds|Treat Wounds]], you gain the +2 circumstance bonus from having fresh ingredients, even if not in wilderness. If you do this in the wilderness, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus instead.
