You apply a frayed thread, a pinch of fulu ash, or a similar undone charm to your weapon, and swing to break a spell. Make a Strike against an enemy. If you hit and deal damage, you attempt to counteract a single spell active on the target (your choice). Your counteract rank is equal to half your level (rounded up), and your counteract check modifier is equal to your class DC - 10.
