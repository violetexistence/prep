If words could kill, the poet might rule the world. Your words can. You gain the [[Feats/Bon Mot|Bon Mot]] skill feat. You can spend a Mythic Point when rolling the Diplomacy check for Bon Mot to attempt the check at mythic proficiency. If the check succeeds, you can also deal mental damage equal to your level to the target (double on a critical success).
