# Childlike Plant
## Feat 1
### [[leshy]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** chrysanthemum leshy heritage or peachchild leshy heritage
* * *
You're adept at hiding your plantlike features to pass as a human. You become trained in Deception (or another skill if you're already trained in Deception). You don't require a disguise kit when attempting Deception checks to Impersonate a human. In addition, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to Impersonate checks to pretend that you're a human version of yourself, rather than a leshy. This bonus doesn't apply to other checks to Impersonate humans.
