# Bless Toxin
## Feat 7
### [[general]][[skill]][[void]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** master in Crafting; deity who grants harm divine font
* * *
You pour void energy into toxins you create to further debilitate your targets. When you [[Actions/Craft|Craft]] an alchemical poison (rather than create it with advanced alchemy, Quick Alchemy, or another means), it becomes a blessed alchemical poison and gains the void trait. When a creature is afflicted with a blessed alchemical poison, for 1 round, any Hit Points it would regain from a vitality effect are reduced by 5, or by 10 if you are legendary in Crafting.
