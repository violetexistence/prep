# Smoke Curtain `pf2:2`
## Feat 8
### [[gunslinger]]

**Category** class; 




**Requirements** You're wielding a loaded firearm and are wearing or holding a dose of black powder.

* * *

You load an extra dose of powder into your shot, causing it to belch a cloud of smoke. You make a Strike with your firearm and create a cloud of smoke in a 20-foot emanation centered on your location. Creatures are [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] while within the smoke, and creatures outside the area are concealed to creatures within the smoke. The smoke dissipates at the start of your next turn. If your Strike is a critical failure, your firearm misfires.
