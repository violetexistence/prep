# Dragon Spit
## Feat 1
### [[human]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Tian-Dan ethnicity
* * *
Many Tian-Dan claim to have dragon blood in their veins, and in your case, this is true-you can spit energy, and you might have an especially visible sign of your draconic heritage. Choose one of the following cantrips: [[Spells/Acid Splash|Acid Splash]], [[Spells/Electric Arc|Electric Arc]], [[Spells/Ignition|Ignition]], or [[Spells/Ray of Frost|Ray of Frost]]. You can cast this spell as an innate arcane spell at will, and when you cast it, the spell's energy emerges from your mouth.
