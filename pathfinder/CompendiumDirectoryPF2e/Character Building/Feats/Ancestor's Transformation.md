# Ancestor's Transformation
## Feat 13
### [[strix]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You can commune with ancestor spirits to assume the form of an enormous primeval strix. You can cast 5th-rank [[Spells/Aerial Form|Aerial Form]] as a primal innate spell once per day, but you take the form of a primeval strix, using the statistics for a bird form.
