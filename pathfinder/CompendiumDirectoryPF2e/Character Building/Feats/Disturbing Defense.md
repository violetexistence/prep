# Disturbing Defense
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Oozemorph Dedication
* * *
Your internal organs and blood vessels have shifted and changed, and even you don't know precisely where in your body they are. You gain resistance to precision damage equal to 2 + your number of class feats from the oozemorph archetype. The DC of your flat checks to recover from persistent bleed damage is 13, rather than 15.
