# Ghosts in the Storm `pf2:1`
## Feat 12
### [[air]][[electricity]][[impulse]][[kineticist]][[primal]][[stance]]

**Category** class; 




Clouds, like eager pets, are drawn to you and to those in your good graces. Fast-moving gray clouds surround you, as well as your allies while they're in your kinetic aura. Anyone surrounded by these clouds gains a +2 status bonus to Reflex saves and Acrobatics checks.

When an affected creature uses a move action, clouds dance around it. Until the start of its next turn, it's [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]], and its Strikes gain the _[[Equipment/Shock|Shock]]_ rune.
