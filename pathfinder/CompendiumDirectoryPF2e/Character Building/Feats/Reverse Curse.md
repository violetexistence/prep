# Reverse Curse
## Feat 12
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Counter Curse
* * *
When you counter a curse or misfortune effect, you send it back to destroy its originator. Whenever you succeed at the counteract check to Counter Curse, the creature is affected by its own curse or misfortune effect, attempting a saving throw against its own DC if the effect allows a saving throw. In the case of a constant ability, such as a misfortune aura, the creature is affected only until the beginning of its next turn, when the ability reasserts itself.
