**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** seneschal witch
* * *
As you work to understand the connection with your missing patron, it's increasingly easy to form bonds with those around you. Raw magical energy spills easily through the connection but, without a patron's control, it sometimes resists your demands for it to form proper spells.

You gain the Witch's Charge feat, but can't choose your familiar or another creature with the minion trait as a charge. When you cast or Sustain manifest will, as long as your charge is within 30 feet, you can choose to center the spell's emanation on your charge instead of yourself.
