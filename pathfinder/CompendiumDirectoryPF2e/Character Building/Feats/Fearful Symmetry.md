# Fearful Symmetry `pf2:1`
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]][[emotion]][[fear]][[mental]][[visual]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Werecreature Dedication; weretiger
* * *
**Requirements** You're in hybrid or tiger shape and your last action was a critically successful Strike with your unarmed attack.

* * *

You attack with a feline grace as captivatingly beautiful as it is deadly. All enemies within 30 feet of the creature you critically hit must attempt at a `Will check` save against your class DC. Enemies that fail their saves become [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]] and are [[Conditions/Fascinated|Fascinated]] with you for 1 round. Your hostile actions don't end this fascination, but those of your allies do. Regardless of the effects of the save, the creature is immune to Fearful Symmetry for 1 hour.
