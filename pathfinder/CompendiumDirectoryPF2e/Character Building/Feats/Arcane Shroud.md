# Arcane Shroud `pf2:1`
## Feat 14
### [[concentrate]][[magus]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Arcane Cascade; Spellstrike
* * *
**Frequency** once per turn

**Requirements** Your most recent action was to Cast a Spell from a spell slot or make a [[Actions/Spellstrike|Spellstrike]] with a spell from a spell slot.

* * *

Your magic has a powerful aftereffect, briefly granting you a certain spell. When you take this feat, choose three of [[Spells/False Vitality|False Vitality]], [[Spells/Fire Shield|Fire Shield]], [[Spells/Fleet Step|Fleet Step]], [[Spells/Flicker|Flicker]], [[Spells/Invisibility|Invisibility]], [[Spells/Mountain Resilience|Mountain Resilience]], and [[Spells/See the Unseen|See the Unseen]].

You use [[Actions/Arcane Cascade|Arcane Cascade]] and are subject to an additional aftereffect spell of your choice from the three you selected. This aftereffect spell's duration lasts until the end of your next turn or its normal duration, whichever is shorter. Using Arcane Shroud again ends any existing spell you gained from Arcane Shroud.
