# Animal Empathy (Ranger)
## Feat 2
### [[ranger]]

**Category** class; 




You have a connection to the creatures of the natural world that allows you to communicate with them on a rudimentary level. You can use Diplomacy to [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] on animals and to make very simple [[Actions/Request|Requests]] of them. In most cases, wild animals will give you time to make your case.
