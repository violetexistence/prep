# Exult in Violence `pf2:1`
## Feat 10
### [[concentrate]][[divine]][[exemplar]][[light]][[spirit]]

**Category** class; 




**Requirements** You critically hit an enemy this turn.

* * *

You let out a war cry as your blow lands true, and judgment descends on an enemy. A pillar of light deals 4d6 spirit damage with a `Reflex check` save against your class DC to a different enemy selected at random within 30 feet of the target struck. This damage increases to 7d6 if you are 12th level and 10d6 if you are 17th level.
