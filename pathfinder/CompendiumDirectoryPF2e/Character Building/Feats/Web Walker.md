# Web Walker
## Feat 1
### [[anadi]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You have plenty of practice navigating webs. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saves and AC against the [[Spells/Web|Web]] spell, natural webbing, and effects that entrap you in webbing, as well as a +1 circumstance bonus against other effects that snare and entangle you, like the [[Spells/Entangling Flora|Entangling Flora]] spell. Whenever you roll a success on a saving throw against an effect involving a web, you get a critical success instead.
