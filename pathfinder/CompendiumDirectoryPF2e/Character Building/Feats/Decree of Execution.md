# Decree of Execution `pf2:3`
## Feat 18
### [[death]][[incapacitation]][[mythic]][[spirit]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Prophesied Monarch Dedication
* * *
You proclaim that a foe has violated the sanctity of your realm and must die. Speak your decree; a creature you designate within 60 feet who can hear your decree must attempt a `Will check` saving throw against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. Once targeted, the creature is temporarily immune for 1 year. Whether the target perishes or is marked for death depends on their level and the result of their saving throw.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** If the target is 14th level or lower, it drops to 1 Hit point. If the target is 15th level or higher, it takes 50 spirit damage.

**Failure** If the target is 14th level or lower, it dies instantly. If the target is 15th level or higher, it takes 50 spirit damage; if this damage brings it to 0 Hit Points, it dies instantly. Otherwise, it gains weakness 20 to all damage for 1 minute.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but a target who survives the damage is [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]] for 1 minute.

When you speak a Decree of Execution, you can spend a Mythic Point as part of the action to remove the incapacitation trait.
