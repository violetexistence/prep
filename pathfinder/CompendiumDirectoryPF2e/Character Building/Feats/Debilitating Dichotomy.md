# Debilitating Dichotomy `pf2:2`
## Feat 8
### [[concentrate]][[cursebound]][[divine]][[mental]][[oracle]]

**Category** class; 




You reveal a glimpse of the impossible conflicts between the divine anathema behind your curse, forcing you to reckon with another's conflicts as well. You and one creature within 30 feet each take -3d6 mental damage with a `Will check` save, and the target is [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]] if it critically fails its save. You get a degree of success one better than you rolled for your saving throw. At 10th level, and every 2 levels thereafter, the damage increases by 3d6.
