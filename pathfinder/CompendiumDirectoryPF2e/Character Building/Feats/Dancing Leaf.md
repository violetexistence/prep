# Dancing Leaf
## Feat 2
### [[monk]]

**Category** class; 




You are as light as a leaf whirling in the breeze. When you [[Actions/Leap|Leap]] or succeed at a [[Actions/High Jump|High Jump]] or [[Actions/Long Jump|Long Jump]], increase the distance you jump by 5 feet. When calculating the damage you take from falling, don't count any distance fallen while you are adjacent to a wall.
