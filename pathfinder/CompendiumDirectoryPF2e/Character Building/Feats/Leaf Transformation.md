# Leaf Transformation
## Feat 5
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[illusion]][[tanuki]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You know how to run an enterprise that others would never be able to get off the groundâ€”some say it's your savvy acumen or jovial manner, but you know it's because you can cut costs by transforming leaves into money. You can use Deception to [[Actions/Earn Income|Earn Income]], and you gain a +1 status bonus to your check if you do so. The illusion doesn't hold long, though! The GM rolls a secret d20; that many hours after concluding your check, the money transforms back, likely inviting consequences depending on how far the bills traveled from you in the time they were transformed.
