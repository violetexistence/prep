# Robust Health
## Feat 3
### [[general]]

**Category** general; 




Your physiology responds well to first aid. You gain a circumstance bonus to the number of Hit Points you regain equal to your level from a successful attempt to [[Actions/Treat Wounds|Treat your Wounds]] or use [[Feats/Battle Medicine|Battle Medicine]] on you. After you or an ally use Battle Medicine on you, you become temporarily immune to that Battle Medicine for only 1 hour, instead of 1 day.
