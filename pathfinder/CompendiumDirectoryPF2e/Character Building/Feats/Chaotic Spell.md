# Chaotic Spell `pf2:1`
## Feat 8
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[bard]][[manipulate]][[oracle]][[sorcerer]][[spellshape]][[witch]][[wizard]]

**Category** class; 




This is the secret of chaotic magic - your foe can hardly predict and counter your moves if you yourself have no idea what will happen. If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell that deals acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage, roll a d6. The spell's damage type changes to the type below associated with the result of the roll, and each creature who is damaged by the spell takes the listed additional effect.

**1 (Acid):** [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]]

**2 (Cold):** â€“10 ft. penalty to all Speeds until the end of your next turn

**3 (Electricity):** [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the end of your next turn

**4 (Fire):** Persistent fire damage equal to the spell's rank

**5 (Force):** No added effect

**6 (Sonic):**[[Conditions/Deafened|Deafened]] for 2 rounds
