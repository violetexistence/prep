# Pheromonal Message `pf2:1`
## Feat 1
### [[athamaru]][[olfactory]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Your communicative pheromones are particularly well developed from years of living with other athamarus. You send a brief message to one ally within 60 feet, or 120 feet in water. No other creature can understand the message. The message must be short and simple, and can't convey ideas that would require complex or novel wording if spoken, such a creature's name or proper nouns.
