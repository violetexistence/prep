# All in Your Head `pf2:r`
## Feat 18
### [[psyche]][[psychic]]

**Category** class; 




**Trigger** You're about to attempt a Fortitude save or a Reflex save.

* * *

Flames scouring at your body, venom coursing through your veins-you refuse to believe they exist, and nothing can affect you if you don't believe in it. You attempt a Will save against the triggering effect, instead of a Reflex or Fortitude save. You don't gain the benefits of [[Class Features/Fortress of Will|Fortress of Will]] or [[Class Features/Walls of Will|Walls of Will]] on this save.
