You have a natural affinity for problem-solving and the unknown. Whenever you attempt to [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] about a subject or creature, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your next skill check regarding that creature or subject (even if you didn't succeed at the check). This bonus increases to +2 if you are a master in the skill used to Recall Knowledge.
