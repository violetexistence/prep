You slow down, focus, and take a careful shot. Make a ranged Strike with a weapon in the bow or crossbow weapon group. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the attack roll and ignore the target's [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] condition. If the target is [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]], reduce the flat check from being hidden from 11 to 5.
