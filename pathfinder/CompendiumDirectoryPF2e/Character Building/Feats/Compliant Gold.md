# Compliant Gold
## Feat 12
### [[exemplar]][[ikon]]

**Category** class; 




**Usage** imbued into a melee weapon ikon

* * *

You can command your weapon to shrink or grow, for convenience or power. Even when your ikon is not empowered, you can shrink it to a miniature size (with negligible Bulk) and keep it tucked behind an ear, in your hair, or in a similar discreet location. You can shrink your weapon or regrow it to its normal size as part of drawing it, putting it away, swapping it, or picking it up.

**Immanence** Your ikon gains the reach trait. If it already had the reach trait, it instead increases your reach by an additional 10 feet, instead of the usual additional 5 feet.
