# Ricochet Master
## Feat 16
### [[gunslinger]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Ricochet Shot
* * *
You have an eye for angles and can find shots that others believe are impossible. When using [[Feats/Ricochet Shot|Ricochet Shot]], you can bounce your bullet off up to two solid surfaces within your weapon's first range increment instead of just one. In addition, a creature is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] the first time you attack it with a Ricochet Shot during an encounter.
