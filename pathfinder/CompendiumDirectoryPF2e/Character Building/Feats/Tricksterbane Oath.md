You've sworn an oath to ferret out and destroy malevolent shapechangers who pose as mortals with evil intent. You gain a +4 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to detect a shapechanged creature's disguise, and a +2 circumstance bonus to attempts to Recall Knowledge about shapechangers. Whenever you use [[Actions/Overwhelming Combination|Overwhelming Combination]] against a shapechanged creature, you attempt to counteract one polymorph effect on that creature. The counteract rank is half your level rounded up, and the counteract check modifier is your Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus with the weapon used to Strike as part of your Overwhelming Combination. You gain the following edict.

**Edict** You must reveal and slay evil or predatory shapechangers you discover or encounter, as long as you have a reasonable chance of success.
