# Fox Possession
## Feat 17
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[kitsune]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You can project a spiritual form to possess another. You can cast [[Spells/Possession|Possession]] as an innate divine spell once per day. The target of your possession assumes one or more unusual quirks, such as more angular features or strange food preferences, giving the target a â€“1 circumstance penalty to their Deception DC when someone uses [[Actions/Sense Motive|Sense Motive]] to see if they're possessed.
