# Deimatic Display `pf2:1`
## Feat 8
### [[druid]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Intimidation
* * *
Imitating animal threat displays, you make yourself appear larger and more imposing. Attempt an Intimidation check to [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] each enemy within 30 feet. This attempt has the visual trait, loses the auditory trait, and you don't take a penalty if the creature doesn't understand your language. Roll your check only once and compare it to the Will DC of each target. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the check against animal, fungus, and plant creatures and take a â€“2 circumstance penalty against other creatures. Each target is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.
