Whether as a dealer or player, you've learned to spot cheaters. When another creature attempts to [[Actions/Conceal an Object|Conceal an Object]] from you, use your Gambling Lore DC if it's higher than your Perception DC to determine whether they succeed. When you search a creature for a [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] object, you can use Gambling Lore in place of Perception.
