# After You `pf2:0`
## Feat 2
### [[swashbuckler]]

**Category** class; 




**Trigger** You're about to roll initiative.

* * *

You allow your foes to make the first move in a show of incredible confidence. You don't roll initiative; instead you voluntarily go last. You gain [[Feat_Feature Effects/Effect_ Panache|Panache]]. If more than one character uses this ability or another ability to go last, use the normal rules for resolving a tie: NPCs and monsters act before PCs, and within those groups, the creatures can choose whichever order they want.
