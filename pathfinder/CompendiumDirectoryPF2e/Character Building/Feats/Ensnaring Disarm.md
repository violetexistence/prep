# Ensnaring Disarm `pf2:0`
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Iridian Choirmaster Dedication
* * *
**Trigger** Your last action was a critical success to [[Actions/Disarm|Disarm]].

**Requirements** Your student is within 15 feet of the Disarmed creature.

* * *

You smack your foe's item out of their hand so that your student can grab it. Instead of the item falling to the ground in the target's space, you aim your blow to send the disarmed item flying, allowing your student to immediately catch it as a free action; they must have a free hand to do so.
