# Greater Interpose
## Feat 14
### [[champion]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Sacrifice Armor
* * *
Your divine grace empowers you to avoid hits when you otherwise could not.

You can use Sacrifice Armor to reduce any type of damage from an attack or effect requiring a Reflex save. When you use Sacrifice Armor against a critical hit or a critical failure on a Reflex save that would otherwise cause you to take double damage, you take the normal amount of damage instead.
