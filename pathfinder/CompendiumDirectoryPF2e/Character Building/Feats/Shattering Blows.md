# Shattering Blows
## Feat 16
### [[barbarian]][[rage]]

**Category** class; 




Your forceful blows shatter objects with ease. While you are raging, damage from your melee Strikes ignores the first 5 Hardness of an object. If you have the [[Class Features/Devastator|Devastator]] class feature, the damage instead ignores the first 10 points Hardness of an object.
