# Mask of Rejection `pf2:r`
## Feat 5
### [[fortune]][[orc]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Orc Warmask
* * *
**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** You fail a saving throw against an effect from your _warmask_'s magical tradition.

**Requirements** You're wearing your _warmask_.

* * *

Your _warmask_ projects a white-hot fury that attempts to vaporize the offending magic. You reroll the triggering check with a +2 circumstance bonus, but you must use the new result, even if it's worse than your first roll.
