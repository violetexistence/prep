# Bloc Tactics
## Feat 14
### [[mythic]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Broken Chain Dedication
* * *
You have experience in undertaking direct action and know how to protect the identity and health of you and your allies when doing so. During your daily preparations, you can select a number of targets equal to half your level. You disguise the targets to hide their identities, which gives them a +4 status bonus to Deception checks to prevent others from seeing through their disguises, and lets them add their level even if untrained. Additionally, the disguises also protect from smoke, fumes, and inhaled substances, giving the targets a +3 status bonus to saving throws against them. The targets can quickly doff or don their disguises with a two-action activity.
