# Lavasoul
## Feat 1
### [[lineage]][[naari]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Your elemental lineage manifests as magma and molten rock, and you can focus the magma into your hand to attack your foes. You gain a magma spike unarmed attack, which requires a free hand to use. This is an agile, finesse, unarmed attack in the brawling weapon group that deals 1d4 piercing damage, as well as 1 fire damage. Instead of the normal critical specialization effect, the target takes 1d6 persistent fire damage; you gain a bonus on this persistent damage equal to your item bonus to attack rolls on unarmed attacks.
