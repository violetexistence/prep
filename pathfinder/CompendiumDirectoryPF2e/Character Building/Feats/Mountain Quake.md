# Mountain Quake `pf2:1`
## Feat 14
### [[monk]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Mountain Stronghold
* * *
**Requirements** You are in [[Feats/Mountain Stance|Mountain Stance]]

You stomp, shaking the earth beneath you. Creatures on the ground within a 20-foot emanation take damage equal to your Strength modifier (minimum 0), with a `Fortitude check` save against your class DC. On a failure, they also fall [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]. After you use this action, you can't use it again for 1d4 rounds.

* * *

**Special** If you have this feat, the Dexterity modifier cap to your AC while using Mountain Stance increases from +1 to +2.
