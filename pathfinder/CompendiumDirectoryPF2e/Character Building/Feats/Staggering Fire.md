You've learned how to fire at enemies to slow them down, allowing innocents and fellow knights alike time to escape. Make a ranged Strike with a weapon in the bow or crossbow weapon group. On a hit, the target takes a -5-foot circumstance penalty to its Speed until the end of its turn, or a -10-foot circumstance penalty on a critical hit.
