# Siege Ritualist
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** War Mage Dedication
* * *
Sometimes, magical warfare requires the application of more complex arcana. When you attempt a Warfare Lore check as one of the casters of a ritual, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the check. You learn a siege ritual of 2nd rank or lower. You must meet all prerequisites to be the primary caster of a ritual to select it.

At 8th level and every 4 levels thereafter, you learn another siege ritual with the same restriction and with a maximum rank of half that level.
