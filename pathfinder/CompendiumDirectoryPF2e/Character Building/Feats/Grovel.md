# Grovel `pf2:1`
## Feat 5
### [[auditory]][[concentrate]][[emotion]][[kobold]][[mental]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Deception
* * *
You convince your foe you're less of a threat. You attempt to [[Actions/Feint|Feint]] against a creature. Unlike a normal Feint, the creature can be within 30 feet instead of in your melee reach, and you make your check against its Will DC instead of its Perception DC.
