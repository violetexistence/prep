## Feat 18
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Knight Reclaimant Dedication; master proficiency in a weapon
* * *
Inspired by the sixth line of the Crimson Oath, when you oppose the enemies of Lastwall, you aim to excise the rot from the land itself. Make a Strike against an undead creature using a weapon with which you have master proficiency. On a success, in addition to the attack's other effects, the creature takes a –2 status penalty to the DC of any curses, diseases, or poisons it can inflict for 1 round. On a critical success, the undead creature takes the –2 status penalty for 1 round, then a –1 status penalty for an additional round.
