# Azarketi Purification
## Feat 9
### [[azarketi]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You can cast [[Spells/Cleanse Cuisine|Cleanse Cuisine]] as a primal innate spell, but only on liquids. You can cast this spell once every 10 minutes.

You can also use your innate _cleanse cuisine_ on a touched creature instead of a liquid to purify their blood, giving that creature a +2 status bonus for 1 minute on their ongoing saves against poisons already present in their body when you cast the spell.
