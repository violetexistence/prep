Your church ensures that you are cared for. You can use Religion to [[Actions/Coerce|Coerce]], [[Actions/Gather Information|Gather Information]], [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]], or make a [[Actions/Request|Request]] as long as you are in a town or city with a church dedicated to your deity. If the target of the check is also a worshipper of your deity or is your hunted prey, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the check.
