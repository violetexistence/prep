# Courtly Graces
## Feat 1
### [[general]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Society
* * *
You were raised among the nobility or have learned proper etiquette and bearing, allowing you to present yourself as a noble and play games of influence and politics. Unless you are intentionally presenting yourself differently, anyone who speaks with you will assume you are a noble or closely associated with the nobility (such as a prominent servant). You can use Society to [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] on a noble, as well as with Impersonate to pretend to be a type of noble or a specific individual noble. If you use the normal skills in those situations, you receive a +1 circumstance bonus to the check instead.
