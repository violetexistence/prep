# Beast Gunner Dedication
## Feat 6
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[archetype]][[dedication]][[magical]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** expert with at least one type of firearm; trained in Arcana or Crafting; you own a beast gun and have slain the type of creature associated with your beast gun in a fair hunt
* * *
You've unlocked the first hints of your weapon's hidden potential. You treat all beast guns as martial firearms when determining your proficiency with them, even beast guns that are normally advanced weapons. You can change your bonded beast gun to another beast gun you own each day during your daily preparations, as long as you've previously performed a ritual hunt associated with the new beast gun.

The beast gun also acts as a conduit, amplifying any latent or active magic power you have. Unlocking this ability allows you to master it with other magical firearms. You learn to cast spontaneous spells and gain the Cast a Spell activity. You gain a spell repertoire with one cantrip of your choice, from either the arcane or primal spell list. You choose this cantrip from the common spells on your chosen spell list or from other spells you have access to on the list. This cantrip must require a spell attack roll. You're trained in the spell attack modifier and spell DC statistics. Your key spellcasting ability for these spells is either Charisma or Intelligence, chosen when you take this feat.

If you already cast arcane or primal spells from spell slots, you learn one additional cantrip from that tradition. If you're a prepared caster, you can prepare this spell in addition to your usual cantrips per day; if you're a spontaneous caster, you add this cantrip to your spell repertoire.

You also gain [[Actions/Spellsling|Spellsling]].
