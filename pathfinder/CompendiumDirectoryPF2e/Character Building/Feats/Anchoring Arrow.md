# Anchoring Arrow `pf2:2`
## Feat 13
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[arcane]][[elf]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

You can prevent demonic foes from fleeing your wrath via teleportation. Make a bow Strike against a demon. In addition to the normal effects of the Strike, the target must attempt a `Will check` save against your class DC.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target avoids any additional effect.

**Success** The target takes a –5 circumstance penalty to all their movement Speeds for 1 round as arcane coils of magic meddle with their mobility.

**Failure** As success, but a –5 foot circumstance penalty for 1 minute. While the target is affected by this, Anchoring Arrow attempts to counteract any teleportation effect that would move the target, or any effect that would transport the target to a different plane. The arrow has a counteract rank of 7th and a +20 modifier to the roll.

**Critical Failure** As failure, except a –10 foot circumstance penalty, and the duration is 10 minutes.
