# Unleash the Blight `pf2:2`
## Feat 10
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[deviant]][[magical]][[void]]

**Category** class; 




You unleash the rot infecting you, spreading the blight to those nearby. All living creatures in a 60-foot emanation take 1d6 void damage for every 2 levels you have, with a `Fortitude check` save.

**Awakening** The blight is infectious. Creatures damaged by your blight take an additional 1d6 persistent void damage, as they begin to decompose.

**Awakening** The blight is debilitating. Creatures damaged become [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]] for one round on a success, drained 1 for 1 minute on a failure, and [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 2]] for 1 minute on a critical failure.
