# Hell of 1,000,000 Needles `pf2:3`
## Feat 18
### [[impulse]][[kineticist]][[metal]][[overflow]][[primal]]

**Category** class; 




The landscape fills with monumental filaments of metal. The needles lance into a cube 30 feet on a side within 500 feet. Each creature in the area takes 13d6 piercing damage, with a `Reflex check` save against your class DC. Each creature that fails its save is impaled, becoming [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] until it [[Actions/Escape|Escapes]] (the DC is your class DC); a creature that critically failed is also off-guard as long as it's impaled. The hell remains until the end of your next turn, but you can Sustain it up to 1 minute. Using this impulse again ends any previous one. The first time you Sustain it each round, lightning crisscrosses the needles. Each creature in the area takes 3d12 electricity damage with a `Reflex check` save against your class DC. Squares in the area are hazardous terrain. A creature takes 6 piercing damage for every square of the area it moves through.

**Level (20th)** The initial damage is 17d6, and the hazardous terrain damage is 7.
