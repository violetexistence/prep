# Hidden Paragon `pf2:r`
## Feat 20
### [[rogue]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** legendary in Stealth
* * *
**Frequency** once per hour

**Trigger** You successfully use Stealth to [[Actions/Hide|Hide]] and become [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] from all of your current foes, or use Stealth to [[Actions/Sneak|Sneak]] and become [[Conditions/Undetected|Undetected]] to all your current foes.

When you slip out of sight, you disappear. You become [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]] for 1 minute, even if you use a hostile action.
