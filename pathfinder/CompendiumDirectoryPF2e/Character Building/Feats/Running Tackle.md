You charge, throwing your body at your foe in a vicious tackle. Stride twice or make a [[Actions/High Jump|High Jump]] or [[Actions/Long Jump|Long Jump]], then attempt to [[Actions/Grapple|Grapple]] or [[Actions/Shove|Shove]]. If you made a High Jump or Long Jump, you can make the [[Actions/grapple|grapple]] or [[Actions/shove|shove]] at any point in the jump, but you can't travel any farther on the jump after you do.
