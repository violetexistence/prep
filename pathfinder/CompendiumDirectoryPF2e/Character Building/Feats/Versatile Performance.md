# Versatile Performance
## Feat 1
### [[bard]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** polymath muse
* * *
You can rely on the grandeur of your performances rather than ordinary social skills. You can use Performance instead of Diplomacy to [[Actions/make-an-impression statistic=performance|make-an-impression statistic=performance]] and instead of Intimidation to [[Actions/demoralize statistic=performance|demoralize statistic=performance]]. You can also use an acting Performance instead of Deception to [[Actions/impersonate statistic=performance|impersonate statistic=performance]].

In addition, you can use your proficiency rank in Performance to meet the prerequisites of skill feats that require a particular proficiency rank in Deception, Diplomacy, or Intimidation.
