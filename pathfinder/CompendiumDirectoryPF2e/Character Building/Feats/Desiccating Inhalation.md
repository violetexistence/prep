# Desiccating Inhalation `pf2:2`
## Feat 12
### [[archetype]][[divine]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Mummy Dedication
* * *
**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

You draw in the moisture from nearby creatures, draining them dry to heal your wounds. Creatures in a 30-foot cone take 0d8 void damage, with a `Reflex check` save against your class DC. A creature that critically fails this saving throw is also [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]]. As long as at least one creature was damaged by your Desiccating Inhalation, you regain HP equal to your level.

At 14th level and every 2 levels thereafter, the damage increases by 1d8.
