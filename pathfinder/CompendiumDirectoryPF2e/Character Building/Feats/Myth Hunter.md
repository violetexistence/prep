# Myth Hunter `pf2:0`
## Feat 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[skill]][[general]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Hero-God Lore or Legendary Beast Lore
* * *
**Trigger** You successfully [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] to identify a creature that has the mythic trait.

**Frequency** once per 10 minutes

* * *

Your ancestors confronted and bested mythic beasts of Iblydan antiquity. Through a combination of hearing these tales and channeling a hint of those warriors' mythic power, you've developed a knack for bypassing a mythic creature's fabled defenses. The next time you successfully Strike the triggering creature, your Strike treats its mythic resistance as 2 lower. You treat its resistance as 4 lower if your Hero-God Lore or Legendary Beast Lore proficiency rank is expert, 6 lower if your rank is master, and 8 lower if your rank is legendary.

If your Strike would already ignore mythic resistance (because you are a mythic character or wield a mythic weapon), your next successful Strike against the creature instead deals an additional 1d6 precision damage. This additional damage increases to 1d8 if your Hero-God Lore or Legendary Beast Lore proficiency rank is expert, 1d10 if your rank is master, or 1d12 if your rank is legendary.
