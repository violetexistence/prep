**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** animal companion
* * *
You have trained with your animal companion to become a terrifying juggernaut on the battlefield. Your animal companion becomes trained in Intimidation. If your animal companion uses Support while serving as your mount, it grants you the effects of the [[Actions/Aid|Aid]] reaction on your first Intimidation check to [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] on the same turn, even though it can't take reactions.
