# Paralyzing Slash `pf2:2`
## Feat 8
### [[archetype]][[incapacitation]][[occult]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Feverish Enzymes
* * *
Your enzymes can paralyze your foes rather than merely making it harder for them to heal their wounds. Strike with your claw or jaws. If you hit a living non-elf creature, it becomes [[Conditions/Paralyzed|Paralyzed]] unless it succeeds at a `Fortitude check` save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. Regardless of the result of the save, the creature is temporarily immune to Paralyzing Slash for 24 hours. A creature that becomes paralyzed can attempt a new save to end the paralysis at the end of each of its turns, and the DC cumulatively decreases by 1 on each such save.
