# Consume Power `pf2:r`
## Feat 6
### [[impulse]][[kineticist]][[metal]][[primal]]

**Category** class; 




**Trigger** You would take acid, electricity, fire, or sonic damage.

* * *

You absorb energy and hold it in your kinetic gate. You gain resistance equal to your level to the triggering damageâ€”choose one eligible type of resistance. If this reaction prevents any damage, you gain a status bonus equal to half your level to the damage roll of the next metal impulse you use before the end of your next turn.
