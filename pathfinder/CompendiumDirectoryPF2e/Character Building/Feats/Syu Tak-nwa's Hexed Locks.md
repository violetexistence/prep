# Syu Tak-nwa's Hexed Locks
## Feat 8
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[witch]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Living Hair
* * *
Your hair unarmed attack gains the reach trait. You can deliver hexes through your hair. When you successfully cast a hex focus spell that requires 2 or more actions to cast and that doesn't require a spell attack roll, if your target is within your reach, as part of the spellcasting activity you can make a hair Strike against the foe before applying any effects of the hex. If this Strike misses, the hex has no effect.
