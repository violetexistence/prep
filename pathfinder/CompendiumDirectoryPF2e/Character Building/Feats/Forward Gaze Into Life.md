# Forward Gaze Into Life `pf2:2`
## Feat 8
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[concentrate]][[divine]][[exemplar]][[vitality]][[void]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** trespasser in death's realm
* * *
**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

Despite the constant cold of death at your back, you keep your gaze forward into the realm of life. You release two 15-foot cones, aimed exactly opposite each other, one ahead of you that deals 5d10 vitality damage and one behind you that deals 5d10 void damage, each with a `Reflex check` save against your class DC. Creatures that critically fail also take 5 persistent damage, of the same damage type dealt (5 persistent vitality or 5 persistent void).
