# Banner's Inspiration `pf2:1`
## Feat 4
### [[brandish]][[commander]][[emotion]][[flourish]][[mental]][[visual]]

**Category** class; 




You wave your banner, inspiring allies to throw off the shackles of fear. Each ally currently benefiting from your commander's banner reduces their frightened condition by 1 and can immediately attempt a new saving throw against any one mental effect currently affecting them. Regardless of the result, any ally that attempts this save is temporarily immune to Banner's Inspiration for 10 minutes.

* * *

_PFS Note:_ This feat allows a new saving throw, so anything that happens on a failed save still occurs if a PC fails.
