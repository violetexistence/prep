# Denier of Destruction `pf2:r`
## Feat 20
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[cleric]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** healing font
* * *
**Requirements** You have a [[Spells/Heal|Heal]] spell prepared and you aren't [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] to the source of the damage.

**Trigger** Any ally within 30 feet that you can heal with your _heal_ spell would take damage from an attack or effect from a source you can observe.

* * *

You can manipulate the same energies that the _aeon orbs_ use to sustain life. You cast _heal_ on the triggering target. Instead of its normal effects, the _heal_ spell reduces the triggering damage by an amount equal to the Hit Points a 1-action _heal_ spell of that rank would have recovered. As usual, if this reduces the damage to 0, it might also remove additional effects of the triggering attack, such as injury poisons.
