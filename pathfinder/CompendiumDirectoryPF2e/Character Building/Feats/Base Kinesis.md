# Base Kinesis
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Kineticist Dedication
* * *
You gain the Base Kinesis impulse. For the purposes of determining when the range and Bulk improvements of the action occur, your kineticist level is equal to half your level (for example, Base Kinesis for a 10th-level character with this feat would have a range of 45 feet and could affect 1 Bulk of their chosen element).
