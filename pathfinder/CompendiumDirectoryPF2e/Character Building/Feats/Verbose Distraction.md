# Verbose Distraction `pf2:r`
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]][[auditory]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Venture-Gossip Archetype
* * *
**Trigger** You are the target of a physical melee attack.

* * *

You talk so much it can be distracting to your enemies and you're often quick to remind your enemies that you're just a little guy! You don't need to be targeted! You don't need to be the focus of their frustrations! Have they tried writing to their mom or talking to a local priest of Desna? Ow!

You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your AC against the triggering attack.
