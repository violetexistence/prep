# Wall Jump
## Feat 7
### [[general]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** master in Athletics
* * *
You can use your momentum from a jump to propel yourself off a wall. If you're adjacent to a wall at the end of a jump (whether performing a [[Actions/High Jump|High Jump]], [[Actions/Long Jump|Long Jump]], or [[Actions/Leap|Leap]]), you don't fall as long as your next action is another jump. Your previous jump gives you momentum, letting you use High Jump or Long Jump as a single action, but you don't get to Stride as part of the activity.

You can use Wall Jump only once in a turn, unless you're legendary in Athletics, in which case you can use it as many times as you can use consecutive jump actions in that turn.
