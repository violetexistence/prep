# Didactic Strike
## Feat 16
### [[investigator]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Shared Stratagem
* * *
When you find a glaring weakness, you can set your allies up to annihilate your foe.

When you use [[Feats/Shared Stratagem|Shared Stratagem]], you can designate up to 10 allies instead of just one. The foe is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] against the first attack from each designated ally before your next turn, and each ally's first attack deals an extra 2d6 precision damage to the target if it hits.
