# Cruelty
## Feat 4
### [[champion]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** touch of the void
* * *
The harm you deal with your corrupting touch saps the strength from your enemy's body. You can cast touch of the void targeting a living creature using 2 actions instead of 1. If you do, the target is also [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]] for 1 minute if it fails its save ([[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 2]] if it critically fails).
