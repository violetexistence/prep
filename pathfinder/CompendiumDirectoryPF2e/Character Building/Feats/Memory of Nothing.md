# Memory of Nothing `pf2:2`
## Feat 18
### [[manipulate]][[mental]][[mythic]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Apocalypse Rider Dedication
* * *
With a look and a gesture, you turn a thinking creature's mind against itself, causing the creature to struggle to remember how to perform more complex actions. Choose a target within 30 feet and spend a Mythic Point. The target must attempt a `Will check` save against your class DC or spell DC (whichever is higher) at mythic proficiency.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** For the next 3 rounds, if the target performs an activity that requires three or more actions, they take 12d8 mental damage.

**Failure** For the next 3 rounds, if the target performs an activity that requires two or more actions, they take 12d8 mental damage.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target is also [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]] as its mind struggles to function.
