## Feat 5
### [[fetchling]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Your body is almost as flexible as your shadow. When you critically fail at Squeezing, you get a failure instead. Additionally, when you roll a success at an Escape check, you get a critical success instead; if you roll a critical success, you can Step instead of Striding up to 5 feet.
