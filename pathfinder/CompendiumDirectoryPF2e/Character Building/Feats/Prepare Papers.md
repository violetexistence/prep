You're practiced at creating forgeries that establish your outlaw credentials or augment your legal authority. You can [[Actions/Create Forgery|Create Forgery]] as an exploration activity. It takes you about 1 hour per page of the document that you're forging. This time is reduced to 10 minutes per page if you're legendary in Society.
