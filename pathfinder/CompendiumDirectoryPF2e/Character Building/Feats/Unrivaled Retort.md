# Unrivaled Retort `pf2:r`
## Feat 6
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[mythic]]

**Category** class; 




**Trigger** You are about to attempt a Fortitude or Reflex save against an area effect and are wielding a ranged weapon.

* * *

You defy the death and destruction around you while using it to fuel your mythic power, spurring you on to acts of incredible speed and empowering a mighty ranged counterattack. Spend a Mythic Point and attempt the triggering save at mythic proficiency. If the save is successful, you can immediately reload and make a ranged Strike targeting the originator of the triggering effect.
