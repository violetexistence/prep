# Skull Creeper
## Feat 1
### [[ratfolk]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You wear skulls to demoralize foes. You become trained in Intimidation and gain the [[Feats/Intimidating Glare|Intimidating Glare]] skill feat. If you're already trained in Intimidation, you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. If you pay 50 gp for a [[Equipment/Splendid Skull Mask|Splendid Skull Mask]], the mask grants you a +1 item bonus to Intimidation; its usage is worn (mask).
