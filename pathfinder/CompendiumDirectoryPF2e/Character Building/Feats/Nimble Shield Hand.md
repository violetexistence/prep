# Nimble Shield Hand
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Bastion Dedication
* * *
You are so used to wielding a shield that you can do so even while using the hand that's holding it for other tasks that require the dexterity of a hand. The hand you use to wield a shield counts as a free hand for the purposes of the [[Actions/Interact|Interact]] action.

You can also hold another object in this hand (but you still can't use it to wield a weapon). This benefit doesn't apply to tower shields, which are still too cumbersome.
