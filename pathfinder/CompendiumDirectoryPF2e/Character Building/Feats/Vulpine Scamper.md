You're especially nimble while in your full fox shape. While you've Changed Shape into a fox, you gain the following benefits.

*   You can use your own Athletics modifier for checks to [[Actions/High Jump|High Jump]] or [[Actions/Long Jump|Long Jump]].
*   You can scale short distances with a bit of a running start. When you attempt to Climb, and your previous action was to Stride at least 20 feet along solid ground, you gain a climb Speed of 20 feet for the duration of that Climb action.
