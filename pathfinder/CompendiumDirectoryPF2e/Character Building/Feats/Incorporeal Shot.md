## Feat 16
### [[archetype]][[magical]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Eldritch Archer Dedication
* * *
**Frequency** once per day

You can concentrate an immense amount of magic to create a piece of ammunition that phases through everything but your target.

Make a bow or crossbow Strike against a foe who is [[Conditions/Observed|Observed]] or [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] to you (but not [[Conditions/Undetected|Undetected]]).

The ammunition travels to your target in a straight line, passing through any non-magical barriers or walls in its way, though magical barriers stop the arrow. The shot ignores all cover, the [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] condition, the hidden condition, and circumstance bonuses to AC from shields. It has a +4 status bonus to hit creatures wearing any type of armor.

The Strike's damage can't be reduced with a Shield Block reaction using a non-magical shield.
