# Werecreature Dedication
## Feat 2
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[archetype]][[dedication]]

**Category** class; 




**Requirements** You were born into a lineage of true werecreatures or were afflicted with the curse of the werecreature.

* * *

You're a werecreature, able to shift between your humanoid shape, an animal shape, and a monstrous hybrid of the two. You gain the beast and werecreature traits. Choose your werecreature type.

Once chosen, this can't be changed. You gain the [[Feats/Toughness|Toughness]] feat but also a weakness to silver equal to half your level. You gain the [[Actions/Change Shape|Change Shape]] action. On the night of the full moon, you automatically use Change Shape to assume your hybrid shape, and you can't voluntarily activate or dismiss Change Shape until sunrise.

* * *

**Special** If you're a beastkin, you can use unarmed attacks from your hybrid shape while you're in your werecreature hybrid shape. These forms are otherwise separate.
