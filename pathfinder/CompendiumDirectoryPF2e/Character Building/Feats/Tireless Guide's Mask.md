Your mask hosts the legacy of Golden Snake, the Tireless Guide, allowing you to guide others with ease. Your allies can use Follow the Expert to follow you for any of your trained skills, in addition to skills in which you are an expert or better. When they follow you when you use a trained skill, their circumstance bonus is +1. Immediately after you Cast a non-cantrip Spell that targets only one ally, that ally can Stride as a free action.
