# Helpful Halfling
## Feat 9
### [[halfling]]

**Category** ancestry; 




When you aid a friend with a task, you find many ways to help and avoid interfering. On a critical success to [[Actions/Aid|Aid]], you grant your ally a +3 circumstance bonus if you have expert proficiency in the skill (rather than +2), and you grant your ally a +4 circumstance bonus if you have master proficiency (rather than +3). If you roll a critical failure on a check to Aid, you don't give your ally a -1 circumstance penalty to their check.
