# The Bigger They Are `pf2:1`
## Feat 12
### [[bravado]][[swashbuckler]]

**Category** class; 




With reckless speed, you dash, jump and swing around a creature to find a more vulnerable spot. Attempt to [[Actions/tumble-through|tumble-through]] a creature at least one size category larger than you, using the following effects.

* * *

**Critical Success** You move through the enemy's space, treating the squares in its space as difficult terrain (every 5 feet costs 10 feet of movement). If you don't have enough Speed to move all the way through its space, you get the same effect as a failure. If you successfully pass through the target's square, the target gains weakness to your precision damage equal to half your level, which lasts until the end of your turn.

**Success** As success, but the weakness applies only against the next attack you make against the target.

**Failure** Your movement ends, and you trigger reactions as if you had moved out of the square you started in.

**Critical Failure** As failure, and you fall [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]].
