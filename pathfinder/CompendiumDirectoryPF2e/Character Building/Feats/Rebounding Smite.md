# Rebounding Smite `pf2:r`
## Feat 16
### [[cleric]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Channel Smite
* * *
**Trigger** You miss with your Strike during [[Feats/Channel Smite|Channel Smite]].

* * *

The energy from your smite persists for a moment, allowing you to pass it to a new target. Cast the 1-action version of the [[Spells/Harm|Harm]] or [[Spells/Heal|Heal]] spell you expended, targeting a creature other than the target of your Strike.
