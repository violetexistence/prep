# Deceptive Tactics
## Feat 1
### [[commander]]

**Category** class; 




**Requirements** You can prepare at least three tactics.

* * *

Your training has taught you that the art of war is the art of deception. You can use your Warfare Lore modifier in place of your Deception modifier for Deception checks to [[Actions/Create a Diversion|Create a Diversion]] or [[Actions/Feint|Feint]], and can use your proficiency rank in Warfare Lore instead of your proficiency rank in Deception to meet the prerequisites of feats that modify the Create a Diversion or Feint actions (such as Lengthy Diversion). You gain the Lengthy Diversion feat.
