# Mind Shards `pf2:2`
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]][[concentrate]][[magical]][[mental]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Mind Smith Dedication
* * *
With a swing and a thought, you detonate your mind weapon into a burst of psychic shards that shred the mind. You concentrate and unleash a 15-foot cone that deals 1d6 mental damage to all creatures in the area, with a `Will check` save against the higher of your class DC or spell DC. After the attack, your mind weapon automatically re-forms, and you can't use this ability again for 1 minute. Mind Shards' damage increases by 1d6 at level 7 and every two levels thereafter.
