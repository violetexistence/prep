**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** charhide goblin heritage
* * *
You've spent enough time on fire that you know how to use it to your advantage. You can light yourself thoroughly on fire with a held torch, a bottle of alchemist's fire, or a similar incendiary, dealing yourself 1d6 persistent fire damage.

As long as you are suffering persistent fire damage, all your melee attacks against adjacent creatures deal an additional 1 fire damage per weapon damage die. Any creature that successfully Grapples, Shoves, or Trips you takes 1d6 fire damage; if it uses a weapon for that action, the weapon takes the damage instead.

You must still attempt the flat check to remove the Persistent Fire Damage each round, as normal.
