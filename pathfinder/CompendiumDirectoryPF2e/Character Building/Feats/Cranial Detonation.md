# Cranial Detonation `pf2:0`
## Feat 18
### [[death]][[mindshift]][[psyche]][[psychic]]

**Category** class; 




**Frequency** once per round

**Trigger** You successfully reduce one or more non-mindless enemies to 0 Hit Points with a spell.

* * *

As your overwhelming psyche fells a creature, you use its flickering consciousness to detonate psychic energy from the creature's head. Each enemy you reduced to 0 Hit Points dies and its head explodes. Each exploding head generates a shockwave in a 15-foot emanation around that enemy. Each creature in any of the emanations takes 10d6 bludgeoning damage with a `Reflex check`. If this damage reduces an enemy to 0 Hit Points, its head also explodes, potentially damaging more creatures and potentially causing more detonations. A given creature can take damage only once from a single use of Cranial Detonation.
