## Feat 10
### [[archetype]][[stance]]

**Category** class;

* * *

You clear your mind, regulate your breathing, and prepare your muscles in a stance inspired by Kemen Kayton, a graduate of Zimar's Monastery of the Seven Forms. Kemen controversially shunned monastic life and instead used his martial skills as a death-defying stunt performer, winning acclaim for exhibitions that saw him survive great falls and escape deadly traps. While in this stance, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Reflex saving throws and skill checks to [[Actions/Escape|Escape]], as well as resistance 2 to all physical damage.
