You have untold ages of knowledge beneath your belt, focused on the pursuit of enlightenment. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Religion and Society. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.

You also gain the [[Feats/Additional Lore|Additional Lore]] general feat for Samsaran Lore.
