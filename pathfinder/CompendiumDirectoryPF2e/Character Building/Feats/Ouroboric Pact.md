# Ouroboric Pact
## Feat 8
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[archetype]][[occult]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Pactbinder Dedication; master in Occultism
* * *
You've studied pacts at Cobyslarni, or learned under someone who has, and understand them to not only create a bargain between individuals, but a separate entity altogether: the pact itself. You gain the [[Actions/Entreat Pact|Entreat Pact]] action, which you can use in association with any pact from the pactbinder archetype. For example, if you have the [[Feats/Pact of Draconic Fury|Pact of Draconic Fury]], you could Entreat Pact to aid a skill check to obtain an item the dragon desires.

* * *

**Special** Your pacts continually enforce themselves in a circular magical loop. You lose the ability to retrain out of any feats from the pactbinder archetype.
