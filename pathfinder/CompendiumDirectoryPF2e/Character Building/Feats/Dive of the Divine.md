You dive from the sky, bringing down the might of the divine with you. You Fly straight down, landing safely in the nearest unoccupied space directly below you. When you land, all creatures in a 10-foot emanation take 8d10 spirit damage (`Fortitude check` save against the higher of your class DC or spell DC). On a failure, the target is pushed 5 feet (or 10 feet on a critical failure).

At 20th level, the spirit damage increases to 10d10.
