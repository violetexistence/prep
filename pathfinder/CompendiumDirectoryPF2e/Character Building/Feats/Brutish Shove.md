# Brutish Shove `pf2:1`
## Feat 2
### [[fighter]][[press]]

**Category** class; 




**Requirements** You are wielding a two-handed melee weapon.

* * *

Using the momentum of your last attack to throw your weight into another, you make your opponent stumble back. Make a Strike with a two-handed melee weapon. If you hit a target that is your size or smaller, that creature is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the end of your current turn, and you can automatically [[Actions/Shove|Shove]] it, with the same benefits as the Shove action (including the critical success effect, if your Strike was a critical hit). If you move to follow the target, your movement doesn't trigger reactions.

This Strike has the following failure effect.

**Failure** The target becomes [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the end of your current turn.
