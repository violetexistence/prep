# Flamboyant Cruelty
## Feat 8
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[swashbuckler]]

**Category** class; 




You love to kick your enemies when they're down, and you look fabulous when you do.

When you make a melee weapon Strike against a foe that has at least two of the following conditions, you gain a circumstance bonus to your damage roll equal to the number of these conditions the foe has.

The qualifying conditions are [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy]], [[Conditions/Drained|Drained]], [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled]], [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened]], [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened]], and [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied]].

If you hit such a foe, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to skill checks to [[Actions/Tumble Through|Tumble Through]] and to perform your style's Panache-granting actions until the end of your turn.
