# Hand of the Lich
## Feat 14
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Lich Dedication
* * *
Void energy intensifies your undead form and makes your very touch the antithesis of life. You gain the [[Ancestry Features/Advanced Undead Benefits|Advanced Undead Benefits]] The damage die for your fist increases to 1d6 instead of 1d4, it deals void damage instead of bludgeoning damage, and it loses the nonlethal trait. Your fist becomes magical.

When you critically hit a living creature with your fist Strike, the creature is [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] until the end of your next turn unless it succeeds at a `Fortitude check` save against your spell DC. This is a critical specialization effect.
