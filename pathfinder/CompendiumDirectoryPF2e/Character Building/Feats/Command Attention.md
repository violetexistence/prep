# Command Attention `pf2:1`
## Feat 10
### [[archetype]][[auditory]][[aura]][[concentrate]][[emotion]][[mental]][[visual]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Celebrity Dedication

You command the attention of all around you with style, ensuring their gaze falls only upon you until the end of your next turn. Whenever a creature in a 30-foot emanation around you attempts a saving throw against a different visual effect, it gets a result one degree of success better than it rolled. This is a fortune effect.

When an enemy within the aura attempts to use a visual effect that involves focusing its attention on a particular creature (such as a medusa's Focus Gaze), it must succeed at a `Will check` save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher, in order to target any creature except you.

Allies in the aura can attempt to [[Actions/Hide|Hide]] even if they don't have cover, as you are continually providing a distraction.
