# Unkillable `pf2:r`
## Feat 8
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Zombie Dedication
* * *
**Frequency** once per hour

**Trigger** You would be reduced to 0 HP.

* * *

You're relentless and nigh unkillable, shrugging off blows that should destroy you, though they might make your body start to fall apart. You are reduced to 1 HP instead of 0 HP. You must succeed at a `DC 6 Flat check` or your body deteriorates.
