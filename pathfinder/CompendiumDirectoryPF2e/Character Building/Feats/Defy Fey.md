You are keen to the wiles of the fey and can usually shake off their magic. Whenever you fail, but don't critically fail, a save against a spell with a duration of at least 1 round cast by a fey creature, you can attempt a second save against the original DC at the start of your next turn to end any lingering effects the spell might have. This can end persistent damage caused by a spell but can't reverse any effects that have been resolved already (such as damage dealt when the spell was cast).
