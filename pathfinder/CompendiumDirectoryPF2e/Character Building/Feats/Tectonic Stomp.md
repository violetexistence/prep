# Tectonic Stomp `pf2:2`
## Feat 10
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[deviant]][[magical]]

**Category** class; 




You cause minor tremors that topple your enemies. All creatures in a 30-foot emanation who are standing on the ground take 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 2 levels you have, with a `Reflex check` save. A creature that fails its save also falls [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]].

* * *

**Awakening** Your stomp also ejects large fragments from the ground. You raise up to three stone chunks from the ground in unoccupied squares in the emanation; the stones can't be adjacent to one another. The chunks are 5 feet tall, block movement, and are large enough to [[Actions/Take Cover|Take Cover]] behind. They have AC 10, Hardness 8, and Hit Points equal to your level. They are immune to critical hits and precision damage. A stone chunk crumbles away when it has 0 Hit Points, and all of them crumble after 1 minute or when you use Tectonic Stomp again.

* * *

**Awakening** Your stomp rattles those who fail horribly. A creature that critically fails its save is also [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]].
