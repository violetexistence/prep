# Specialized Spirit Companion
## Feat 14
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Spirit Companion; Incredible Companion
* * *
Your animal companion gains a unique specialization, spirit-blessed. Thanks to the blessing bestowed upon it by the spirits of this world. If your animal companion already has the spirit-blessed specialization, it gains one additional specialization of your choice.

**Spirit-blessed:** Your companion is capable of harming wayward spirits, ghosts, and other incorporeal creatures as easy as if they were made of flesh and bone. Your companion's Strikes all gain the effects of the ghost touch property rune.

**Special** You can select this feat up to three times. Each time, add a different specialization to your companion. It's first specialization must be spirit-blessed.
