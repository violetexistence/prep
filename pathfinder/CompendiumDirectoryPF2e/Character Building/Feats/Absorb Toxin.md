# Absorb Toxin `pf2:r`
## Feat 9
### [[grippli]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** You are not immune to diseases or poisons
* * *
**Trigger** You attempt a saving throw against a disease or poison effect that affects an area.

* * *

Your skin readily absorbs poison and can consciously draw toxins into your body to spare others. Attempt a counteract check against the triggering effect; your counteract rank equals half your level (rounded up), and for the roll use either your class DC – 10 or your spellcasting attribute modifier plus your spellcasting proficiency bonus. If you counteract the triggering effect, you end the effect for all other creatures in the area; however, you must still save against the effect with a –2 penalty to the initial save.
