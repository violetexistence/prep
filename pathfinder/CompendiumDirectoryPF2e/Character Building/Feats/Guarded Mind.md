# Guarded Mind `pf2:0`
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]][[fortune]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Ulfen Guard Dedication
* * *
**Frequency** once per 10 minutes

**Trigger** You fail a saving throw against an effect that has the mental trait.

* * *

When your enemies try to turn your mind against you, thoughts of your anathema bolster you. You can reroll the triggering saving throw with a +2 circumstance bonus, but you must use the new result, even if it's worse.
