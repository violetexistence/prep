# Majestic Proclamation `pf2:2`
## Feat 8
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Starlit Sentinel Dedication
* * *
**Requirements** You're in your sentinel form.

* * *

You announce your name to your enemies, bringing your constellation to bear in a blinding display. Attempt to [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] all enemies within 30 feet. Demoralize loses the auditory trait and gains the visual trait when used this way. In addition to the regular effects of Demoralize, enemies become [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] for 1 minute on a successful check (and also [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] for 1 round on a critical success).

You can use Majestic Proclamation as a single action if your previous action was [[Actions/Starlit Transformation|Starlit Transformation]].
