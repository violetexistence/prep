# Gear Gnash
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** Trapsmith Dedication; expert in Crafting
* * *
Snares you create have complicated inner workings that are quite difficult to disable. Creatures attempting to Disable your snares that use gears must succeed at an additional Thievery check in order to disable the snare. On a failed check, while the snare doesn't fully trigger, the grinding mechanisms deal bludgeoning damage to the creature equal to half your level. The snare still triggers on a critical failure, as normal.
