# Spelldrinker `pf2:1`
## Feat 8
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Rising Blood Magic
* * *
**Requirements** Your last action was to Harvest Blood.

**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

You temporarily add a 3rd-rank spell to your spell repertoire, as determined by the type of creature whose blood you just drank (see table below). If the creature has more than one of the listed traits, choose one and gain the appropriate spell. If the granted spell is not on your chosen tradition's list, you cast the spell as though it was from your chosen tradition. The spell is removed from your spell repertoire after 24 hours, the next time you use Spelldrinker, or when you next make your daily preparations, whichever comes first.
