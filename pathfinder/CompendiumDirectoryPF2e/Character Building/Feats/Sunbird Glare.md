# Sunbird Glare `pf2:1`
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Winged Warrior Dedication
* * *
**Requirements** You're in bright light.

* * *

By keeping your feathers clean and sleek, you can catch the light across your wings to create a startling glare in the eyes of a creature within 20 feet. The target must succeed at a `Fortitude check` save against your class DC or be [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] for 1 round (1 minute on a critical failure). Regardless of their result, the target is temporarily immune to Sunbird Glare for 10 minutes.
