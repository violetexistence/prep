You become a brilliant example of dedication and poise in battle, encouraging your allies to follow suit. When you spend this action, attempt a `Diplomacy check` check. The DC is usually an easy DC of your level, but the GM can assign a different DC based on the circumstances. The effect depends on the result of your check.
