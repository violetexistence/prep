# Alchemical Scholar
## Feat 1
### [[hobgoblin]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You gain the [[Feats/Alchemical Crafting|Alchemical Crafting]] feat. If you would automatically gain that feat (from your background or the alchemist class, for example), you instead gain a different 1st-level Crafting skill feat. Add an additional common 1st-level alchemical formula to your formula book when you take this feat. Each time you gain a level beyond 1st, add one common alchemical formula of that level to your formula book.
