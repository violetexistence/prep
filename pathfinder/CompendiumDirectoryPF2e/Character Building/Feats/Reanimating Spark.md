# Reanimating Spark
## Feat 13
### [[poppet]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** You have the dying condition and are about to attempt a recovery check.

* * *

The magic that animates you strains to keep you alive. You're restored to 1 Hit Point, lose the dying and [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]] conditions, and can act normally on this turn. You gain or increase the wounded condition as normal when losing the dying condition in this way.
