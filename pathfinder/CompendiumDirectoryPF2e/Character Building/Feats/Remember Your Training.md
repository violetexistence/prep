# Remember Your Training `pf2:1`
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Pathfinder Agent Dedication
* * *
**Frequency** once per day

* * *

During your training to become a Pathfinder Agent you were schooled on a wide variety of creatures you might encounter, and you can think back to that training to gain crucial insight in times of need. Attempt a check to Recall Knowledge about a creature you can see, adding your level as a proficiency bonus if you are untrained (rather than 0). If you roll a failure (but not a critical failure) on this check, you get a success instead.
