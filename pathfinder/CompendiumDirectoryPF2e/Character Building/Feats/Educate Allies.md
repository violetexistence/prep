All allies affected by your composition spell gain your +1 circumstance bonus from [[Feats/Well-Versed|Well-Versed]] until the start of your next turn. Teaching your allies also bolsters your own skills; your personal circumstance bonus from Well-Versed also increases to +2 until the start of your next turn.
