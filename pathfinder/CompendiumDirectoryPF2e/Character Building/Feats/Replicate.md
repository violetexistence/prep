# Replicate
## Feat 5
### [[reflection]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Clone-Risen

You've learned to reshape your malleable form. You can cast [[Spells/Illusory Disguise|Illusory Disguise]] once per day as an innate occult spell. This is a transmutation and morph effect, as your body physically transforms, rather than an illusion effect.
