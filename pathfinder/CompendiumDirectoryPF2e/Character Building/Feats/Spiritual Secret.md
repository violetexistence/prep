# Spiritual Secret `pf2:0`
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]][[spellshape]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Seneschal Witch Dedication
* * *
**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

You gain deeper insights into your patron's abandoned power, allowing you to draw on that power more directly. If your next action is to cast a witch cantrip or witch spell that deals damage, it deals spirit damage instead of its normal type. It also loses any traits related to its damage, such as the fire or mental trait, and gains the sanctified and spirit traits instead.
