**Prerequisites** Mortal Herald Dedication
* * *
You declare that an enemy is fit for further punishment in the sight of your deity. If the next action you perform is to Cast a Spell that deals damage, one creature of your choice that takes damage from the spell is marked for rebuke until the end of your next turn. A creature marked this way gains weakness 10 to all damage and becomes immune to Marked for Rebuke for 24 hours.
