# Sacral Monarch
## Feat 14
### [[champion]][[oracle]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Sacral Lord; master in Occultism or Religion
* * *
You have come into your full powers and are truly a monarch of your realm, by your own definition at least. While in your territory, you can cast [[Spells/Banishment|Banishment]] and [[Spells/Inevitable Disaster|Inevitable Disaster]] as innate divine spells, each once per day.
