**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Ostilli Host Dedication

The dart fired by your ostilli can ricochet to strike another creature. The first time each round that a target takes damage when you Spit Ambient Magic, you can choose a second target within 20 feet of the first; that target is also affected by Spit Ambient Magic.
