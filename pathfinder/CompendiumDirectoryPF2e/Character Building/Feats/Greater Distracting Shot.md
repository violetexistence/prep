# Greater Distracting Shot
## Feat 16
### [[ranger]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Distracting Shot
* * *
Even a single missile can throw off your enemy's balance, and more powerful attacks leave it flustered for longer. If you hit your hunted prey with a ranged weapon, it's [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the start of your next turn. If you critically hit your prey or hit it twice on the same turn with a ranged weapon, it's off-guard until the end of your next turn instead.
