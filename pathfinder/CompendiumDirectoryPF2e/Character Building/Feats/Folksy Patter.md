# Folksy Patter
## Feat 1
### [[halfling]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You are adept at disguising coded messages as folksy idioms. Using slang, jokes, halfling loanwords, and the like, you convey a simple message consisting of three basic words (such as "Danger assassin flee" or "Meet me moonrise"). Your intended listener can attempt a `DC 20 Perception check` check to discern the message. This DC is reduced by 5 if the listener is a halfling or has Folksy Patter, or by 10 if both apply (`DC 15 Perception check` `DC 10 Perception check`). Eavesdroppers can also attempt a `Perception check` check against your Deception DC to discern your meaning. Any bonuses or penalties to Perception checks to [[Actions/Sense Motive|Sense Motive]] apply to checks to understand Folksy Patter.
