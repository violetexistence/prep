# Bone Caller
## Feat 9
### [[lizardfolk]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Using a mixture of dinosaur bones and the bones of your ancestors to focus your magic, you animate lizards and dinosaurs to carry messages or serve as mounts. You can cast [[Spells/Animal Messenger|Animal Messenger]] and [[Spells/Marvelous Mount|Marvelous Mount]] as primal innate spells once per day each. The animal messenger is always a Tiny dinosaur or lizard, and your innate spell transforms it from bones to flesh, even if there are no dinosaurs or lizards nearby. The phantom steed looks like a dinosaur rather than a horse but functions identically.
