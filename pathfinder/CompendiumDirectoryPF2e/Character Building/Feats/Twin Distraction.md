# Twin Distraction
## Feat 4
### [[rogue]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Twin Feint
* * *
**Requirements** You are wielding two melee weapons, each in a different hand.

* * *

Your movements with two weapons are so swift and disorienting that they befuddle your opponent. When using [[Feats/Twin Feint|Twin Feint]], if both your Strikes deal damage to a targeted creature, the target must succeed at a `Will check` saving throw against your class DC or become [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] until the end of your next turn.
