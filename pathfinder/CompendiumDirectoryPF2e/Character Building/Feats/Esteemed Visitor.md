# Esteemed Visitor
## Feat 1
### [[shoony]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Your polite manners and natural ability to comfort others make it easy for you to break down cultural barriers and earn strangers' trust. While you are in a settlement, when you roll a critical failure on a Diplomacy check to [[Actions/Gather Information|Gather Information]] or [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]], you get a failure instead.
