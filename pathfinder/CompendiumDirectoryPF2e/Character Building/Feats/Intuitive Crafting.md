# Intuitive Crafting
## Feat 1
### [[nephilim]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Aeonbound
* * *
Your affinity with process and order makes you a natural artisan. You are trained in Crafting. If you were already trained in Crafting, you instead gain the [[Feats/Specialty Crafting|Specialty Crafting]] skill feat in a specialty of your choice; if you have both, you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. In addition, when you critically fail to Repair an item, you get a failure instead.

_Note: If you were already trained in Crafting, you need to manually add the Specialty Crafting feat or select an alternative skill._
