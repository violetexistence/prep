# Flying Flame `pf2:2`
## Feat 1
### [[fire]][[impulse]][[kineticist]][[primal]]

**Category** class; 




A Tiny shape of flame appears, taking a form of your choiceâ€”such as a bird, an arrow, or a simple sphere. It Flies from you up to 30 feet in a path you choose. Each creature it passes through takes 1d6 fire damage with a `Reflex check` save against your class DC. A creature attempts only one save, even if the flame passes through it multiple times.

* * *

**Level (+2)** The damage increases by 1d6.
