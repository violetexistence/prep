# Form of the Dragon
## Feat 17
### [[dragonblood]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You can briefly transform into a paragon of your draconic ancestry. You can cast [[Spells/Dragon Form|Dragon Form]] as an 8th-rank innate spell once per day. This spell has the same tradition as your draconic exemplar. When you cast this innate spell, you must transform into your draconic exemplar. However, if you have the [[Feats/Arcane Dragonblood|Arcane Dragonblood]], [[Feats/Divine Dragonblood|Divine Dragonblood]], [[Feats/Occult Dragonblood|Occult Dragonblood]], or [[Feats/Primal Dragonblood|Primal Dragonblood]] lineage feat, you can instead choose any dragon of that tradition.
