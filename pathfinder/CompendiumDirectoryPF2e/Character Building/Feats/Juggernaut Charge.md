# Juggernaut Charge `pf2:2`
## Feat 8
### [[flourish]][[guardian]]

**Category** class; 




**Requirements** You are wearing medium or heavy armor.

* * *

As you move forward in a rush, you put the weight of your armor behind an attack that can drag a foe with you. You Stride. If you end your movement within melee reach of at least one enemy, you can make a melee Strike against that enemy, then Stride again. If your Strike hit and dealt damage, that enemy is pulled with you and is moved the same direction and distance as your second Stride.
