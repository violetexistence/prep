# Invoke the Elements `pf2:2`
## Feat 9
### [[changeling]][[primal]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Brine May, Snow May, Veil May, or Virga May
* * *
**Frequency** once per day

* * *

You summon an aura of shimmering heat, flurrying snow, crashing waves, or swirling wind and lightning.

For 1 minute, you gain [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealment]] against creatures more than 5 feet away, and any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of you suffers 1d12 damage (`Reflex check` save using your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher).

At 13th and 17th level, this damage increases by 1d12.

A veil may changeling deals fire damage, a snow may changeling deals cold damage, a brine may changeling deals bludgeoning damage and the effect gains the water trait, and a virga may changeling deals electricity damage.
