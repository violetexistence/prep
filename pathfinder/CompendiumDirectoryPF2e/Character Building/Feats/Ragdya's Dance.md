# Ragdya's Dance
## Feat 9
### [[vanara]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per hour

**Trigger** An adjacent observed creature succeeds at an attack roll against you.

* * *

Even when faced with deadly danger, you fight with the rapturous laughter of Ragdya in your heart and can play impossible tricks. After resolving the successful attack, the triggering creature must attempt a `Will check` save against the higher of your class DC or your spell DC. On a failure, you and the triggering creature switch places. You and the triggering creature must each be able to fit in the new space, and your positions must be unoccupied.
