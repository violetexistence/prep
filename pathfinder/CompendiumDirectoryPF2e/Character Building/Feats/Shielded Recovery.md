# Shielded Recovery
## Feat 4
### [[commander]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Officer's Medical Training
* * *
You can bandage wounds with the same hand you use to hold your shield. You can use the same hand you are using to wield a shield to [[Actions/Treat Wounds|Treat Wounds]] or use Battle Medicine, and you are considered to have a hand free for other uses of Medicine as long as the only thing you are holding or wielding in that hand is a shield. When you use Battle Medicine on an ally while wielding a shield, they gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC and Reflex saves that lasts until the start of your next turn or until they are no longer adjacent to you, whichever comes first.
