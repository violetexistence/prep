# Defensive Stratagem
## Feat 8
### [[investigator]]

**Category** class; 




By scrutinizing a foe, you learn how to better avoid its attacks. When you use Devise a Stratagem, you can choose a defensive stratagem instead of an attack or skill stratagem after you roll a d20.

**Defensive Stratagem** You can't attempt to Strike the target until the start of your next turn. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to all your defenses against effects caused by the target until the start of your next turn.
