# Clotting Elixirs
## Feat 2
### [[alchemist]]

**Category** class; 




Your restorative concoctions have a clotting effect on the drinker's blood. When a living creature drinks an infused elixir with the healing trait that you have created, it can immediately attempt a `DC 10 Flat check` to remove any persistent bleed damage.
