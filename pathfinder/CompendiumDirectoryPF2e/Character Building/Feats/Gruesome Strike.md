# Gruesome Strike `pf2:1`
## Feat 12
### [[champion]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** champion's reaction that grants extra damage with your Strikes (including the desecration, iniquity, and obedience causes)
* * *
**Requirements** Your Strikes currently deal extra damage from your champion's reaction.

* * *

Make a Strike against the creature that triggered your champion's reaction. If you hit, double the extra damage the target takes from your reaction, and the target must succeed at a `Fortitude check` save against your class DC or be [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]]. Regardless of the result, the creature is temporarily immune to your Gruesome Strike for 24 hours.
