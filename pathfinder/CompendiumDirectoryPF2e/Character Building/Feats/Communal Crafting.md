# Communal Crafting
## Feat 2
### [[general]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** expert in Crafting
* * *
You can have other PCs help you [[Actions/Craft|Craft]] an item, under your direction. A helper PC rolls a check with a skill in which they're trained. The skill must be Crafting or another skill relevant to the item, as determined by the GM. For example, a PC might use Religion to help you Craft an item with the divine trait or Warfare Lore to help you Craft a weapon. Your roll still determines whether you successfully create the item. Any helper's roll contributes toward reducing the cost of raw materials using the numbers from the [[Actions/Earn Income|Earn Income]] table; this uses the ally PC's proficiency rank in the skill and their level â€“ 1 for their level. Helping PCs must accompany you throughout the Craft activity (preventing them from pursuing other downtime activities) or the benefit is lost. The GM might determine that only a certain number of PCs can help depending on the circumstances. Communal Crafting also allows you to take the role of a helper when someone else is crafting, provided they accept your help.
