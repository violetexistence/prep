# Takedown Expert
## Feat 1
### [[investigator]]

**Category** class; 




You've mastered combat practices that let you get up close and bring down perpetrators alive. You can use your Intelligence modifier on attack rolls for an attack stratagem if you're using a weapon of the club group in one hand (like a club or staff), in addition to the usual weapons, and those Strikes qualify for your strategic strike. Additionally, you can make any of your Strikes nonlethal without taking the normal â€“2 penalty.
