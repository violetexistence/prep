# Ill Tide `pf2:r`
## Feat 9
### [[concentrate]][[merfolk]][[misfortune]][[primal]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** A creature within 30 feet of you critically fails an attack roll, skill check, or saving throw

* * *

Some land dwellers say that merfolk are bad luck. You might not cause bad luck, but you can certainly keep it going. The next time the triggering creature attempts an attack roll, skill check, or saving throw, it must roll twice and use the worse result.
