## Feat 18
### [[champion]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** lay on hands
* * *
Your healing energies linger after you cast, providing continual benefits. An ally that recovers Hit Points from your [[Spells/Lay on Hands|Lay on Hands]] gains 10 temporary Hit Points immediately and at the start of their turn during each of the next 10 rounds. These temporary HP last until the start of the creature's next turn. This effect ends if the ally is knocked [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]].
