# Say That Again! `pf2:r`
## Feat 6
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[general]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** expert in Athletics
* * *
**Trigger** An opponent gets a critical failure when attempting to [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] you or Lie to you.

* * *

The world is full of obnoxious weasels who think they can pull one over on you-put them in their place! When an adjacent creature attempts to Lie to you or to Demoralize you and gets a critical failure on the roll, you can use your reaction to make a [[Actions/Shove|Shove]] attempt against that opponent. If combat results, you can roll Intimidation for your initiative check.
