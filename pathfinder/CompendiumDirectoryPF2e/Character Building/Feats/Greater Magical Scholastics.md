# Greater Magical Scholastics
## Feat 10
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Archaeologist Dedication; Magical Scholastics
* * *
You broaden your magical studies, allowing you to find the right path, detect hidden objects, and conceal those objects from unscrupulous rivals.

You can cast [[Spells/Augury|Augury]], [[Spells/Locate|Locate]], and [[Spells/Veil of Privacy|Veil of Privacy]] as occult innate spells, each once per day. You can cast this _veil of privacy_ spell only on an object, and it's automatically heightened to half your level rounded up.
