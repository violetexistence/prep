# Axe Thrower
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Turpin Rowe Lumberjack Dedication
* * *
You have mastered the weight and balance of a variety of axes and can lob them with ease. Any one-handed axe weapon you wield has the thrown trait with a range of 10 feet. For axes that already have the thrown trait, the range increases by 10 feet. When you critically succeed at an attack roll with a thrown axe weapon, you apply the axe's critical specialization effect.
