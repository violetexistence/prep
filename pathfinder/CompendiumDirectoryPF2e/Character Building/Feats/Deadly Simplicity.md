# Deadly Simplicity
## Feat 1
### [[cleric]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** deity with a simple or unarmed attack favored weapon; trained with your deity's favored weapon
* * *
When you are wielding your deity's favored weapon, increase the damage die size of that weapon by one step.

If your deity's favored weapon is an unarmed attack (such as a fist, if you worship [[Deities/Irori|Irori]]) and its damage die is smaller than d6, instead increase its damage die size to d6.
