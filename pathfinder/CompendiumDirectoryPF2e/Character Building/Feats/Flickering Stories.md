# Flickering Stories
## Feat 8
### [[archetype]][[divine]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Campfire Chronicler Dedication
* * *
Stories, like fires, can create shadows as much as they illuminate. When you Offer a Story, you can become [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] by shifting shadows for the duration instead of the normal benefits. The action then gains the shadow trait. You can't use this concealment to [[Actions/Hide|Hide]], as normal for concealing effects that leave your location obvious. The creature you share a story with can choose this benefit even if you did not.
