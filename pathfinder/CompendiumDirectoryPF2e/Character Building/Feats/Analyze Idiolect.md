# Analyze Idiolect
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** Linguist Dedication; expert in Deception; expert in Society
* * *
You break down a specific individual's idiolect, memorizing their speech mannerisms and habits.

If you interact with someone for at least 10 minutes, when you later attempt to [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] that individual, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to your Deception checks and DCs. Due to the intense character study required, you can't remember more than one idiolect at a time.
