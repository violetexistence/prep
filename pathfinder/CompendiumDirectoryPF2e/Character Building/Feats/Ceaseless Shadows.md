# Ceaseless Shadows
## Feat 13
### [[halfling]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Distracting Shadows
* * *
You excel at going unnoticed, especially among a crowd. You no longer need to have cover or be [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] to [[Actions/Hide|Hide]] or [[Actions/Sneak|Sneak]]. If you would have lesser cover from a creature, you gain standard cover instead and can [[Actions/Take Cover|Take Cover]]; if you would have standard cover from a creature, you gain greater cover instead.
