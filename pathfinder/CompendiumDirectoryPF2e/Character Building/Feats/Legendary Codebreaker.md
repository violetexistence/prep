# Legendary Codebreaker
## Feat 15
### [[general]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** legendary in Society
* * *
Your skill with languages and codes is so great that you can decipher information with little more than a quick read through a text. You can [[Actions/Decipher Writing|Decipher Writing]] using Society while reading at normal speed. If you slow down and spend the full amount of time that's ordinarily required and roll a success, you get a critical success; if you critically succeed while spending the normal amount of time, you gain a nearly word-for-word understanding of the document.
