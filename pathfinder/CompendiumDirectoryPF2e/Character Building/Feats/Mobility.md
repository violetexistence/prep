# Mobility
## Feat 2
### [[rogue]]

**Category** class; 




You move without leaving an opening. When you Stride and move half your Speed or less, that movement does not trigger reactions. You can use Mobility when Climbing, Flying, or Swimming instead of Striding if you have the corresponding movement type.
