As you reach ever higher in your quest to achieve true divinity, the powers of life and death flow evermore easily from you. Choose either [[Spells/Heal|Heal]] or [[Spells/Harm|Harm]]; you gain the chosen spell as an 8th rank innate spell you can cast three times per day. Your hierophant can cast these innate spells as well by expending one of your daily uses.
