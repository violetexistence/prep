# Cantorian Restoration `pf2:r`
## Feat 17
### [[healing]][[hobgoblin]][[vitality]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** A living creature within 60 feet would die.

* * *

The energy that flows in your blood can save a life in the direst of times. You prevent the creature from dying and restore 6d8 + your Constitution modifier Hit Points to it. You can't use Cantorian Restoration if the triggering effect was a death effect or an effect that leaves no remains, such as [[Spells/Disintegrate|Disintegrate]].
