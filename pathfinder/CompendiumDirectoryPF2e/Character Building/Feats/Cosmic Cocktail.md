# Cosmic Cocktail
## Feat 14
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Wandering Chef Dedication
* * *
**Frequency** once per day

* * *

Using the liquors, vinegars, and fruits or herbs at your disposal, you spend 1 minute to create a cocktail with colors reminiscent of space and its stars. If immediately consumed after creation, you temporarily see everything all at once, and you gain a new understanding of the universe. You gain the effects of a [[Spells/Truesight|Truesight]] spell for 10 minutes. Use your Crafting or Cooking Lore for any counteract checks.
