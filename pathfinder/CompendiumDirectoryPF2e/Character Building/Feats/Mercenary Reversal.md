# Mercenary Reversal `pf2:2`
## Feat 18
### [[auditory]][[commander]][[concentrate]][[incapacitation]][[mental]]

**Category** class; 




**Requirements** You and your allies are currently outnumbered by enemies on the battlefield.

* * *

Even though the fight seems to be surging against you and your compatriots, you know that a key ally can always turn the tide. Choose a target you are currently observing. You assail it with a list of reasons why it should join you and why its defeat if it does not is surely inevitable. The target attempts a `Will check` save against your class DC with the following results.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is uninterested in joining you and is temporarily immune to further uses of this ability for 24 hours.

**Success** The target is [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]] as it is forced to consider the merits of your offer.

**Failure** The target swaps sides and joins you for the duration of the battle. It gains the controlled condition, but it can attempt a Will save whenever it takes damage or whenever you direct it to take an action that goes against its nature. On a success, the effect ends and it rejoins its former allies.

**Critical Failure** As a failure, but the target is so impressed by your leadership that it thanks you for the privilege of fighting alongside you; if it is still alive at the end of combat, it turns over any coins, wealth or other monetary possessions it has as tribute.
