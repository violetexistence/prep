# Arms That Cut the Waves
## Feat 2
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[mythic]]

**Category** class; 




River, lake, sea, or ocean, the water calls to you, and you don't fear its depths. When you attempt an Athletics check to Swim, you can spend a Mythic Point to attempt the check at mythic proficiency. When you would run out of air and begin suffocating, you can instead spend a Mythic Point to hold your breath for 10 more rounds.
