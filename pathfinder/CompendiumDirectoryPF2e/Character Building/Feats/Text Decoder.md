# Text Decoder
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** Palatine Detective Dedication
* * *
Thanks to your constant involvement with cryptic texts, you have attained an almost-supernatural ability to decipher complex codes and understand ancient writings. You can always use [[Actions/decipher-writing skill=occultism|decipher-writing skill=occultism]]{Occultism} or [[Actions/decipher-writing skill=religion|decipher-writing skill=religion]]{Religion} when you [[Actions/Decipher Writing|Decipher Writing]], no matter the subject matter. In addition, you can ignore language constraints when Deciphering Writing, and when you critically fail to Decipher Writing, you get a failure instead.
