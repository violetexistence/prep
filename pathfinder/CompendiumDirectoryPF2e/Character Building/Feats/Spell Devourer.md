### [[orc]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Pervasive Superstition
* * *
You don't just resist magic; you devour it. Whenever you succeed at a saving throw against a spell or magical effect, you gain temporary Hit Points equal to double the spell's rank, or equal to the level if the magical effect isn't a spell. These temporary Hit Points last until the end of your next turn.
