# Patch Job
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Vehicle Mechanic Dedication
* * *
You can patch up damage to an object with a quick fix. You gain the [[Feats/Improvised Repair|Improvised Repair]] general feat. When you use Improvised Repair, you can attempt a Crafting check with the same DC as Repair. If you succeed, you can use the object as a normal object of its type until it takes damage rather than as a shoddy object of its type.
