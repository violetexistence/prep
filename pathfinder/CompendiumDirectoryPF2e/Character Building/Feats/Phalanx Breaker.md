# Phalanx Breaker `pf2:2`
## Feat 6
### [[gunslinger]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Way of the Vanguard
* * *
**Requirements** You're wielding a two-handed firearm or a two-handed crossbow.

* * *

You know that to take out an enemy formation, you must punch a hole through its center. Make a ranged Strike with the required weapon against a target within the weapon's first range increment. The target is pushed directly back 10 feet (20 feet on a critical hit), and if this pushes the target into an obstacle, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to half your level.
