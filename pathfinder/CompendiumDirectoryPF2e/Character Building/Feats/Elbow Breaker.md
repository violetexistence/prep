# Elbow Breaker `pf2:1`
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Wrestler Dedication
* * *
**Requirements** You have a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]].

* * *

You bend your opponent's body or limbs into agonizing positions that make it difficult for them to maintain their grip. Make an unarmed melee Strike against the creature you have grabbed or restrained. This Strike has the following effects in addition to its usual effects.

* * *

**Critical Success** You knock one held item out of the creature's grasp. It falls to the ground in the creature's space.

**Success** You weaken your target's grasp on the item. Further attempts to [[Actions/Disarm|Disarm]] the target of that item gain a +2 circumstance bonus, and the target takes a â€“2 circumstance penalty to attacks with the item or other checks requiring a firm grasp on the item. The creature can end the effect by Interacting to change its grip on the item; otherwise, it lasts as long as the creature holds the item.
