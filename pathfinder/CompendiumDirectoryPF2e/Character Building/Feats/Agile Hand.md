# Agile Hand
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Spell Trickster Dedication; ability to cast mage hand
* * *
When you cast [[Spells/Telekinetic Hand|Telekinetic Hand]], you can modify its target to be a [[Equipment/Thieves' Toolkit|Thieves' Toolkit]]. When you Cast the Spell in this way, the tools move up to 20 feet towards a device or lock. After you Sustain the spell on future turns, you can use the tools to attempt Thievery checks to [[Actions/Disable a Device|Disable a Device]] or [[Actions/Pick a Lock|Pick a Lock]] within the spell's range, but you take a -2 penalty to your Thievery check. If you critically fail, the spell ends and you can't use this modification again for 24 hours.
