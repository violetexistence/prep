# Dousing Spell `pf2:1`
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]][[spellshape]][[water]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Elementalist Dedication; water is in your elemental philosophy
* * *
You enhance your spell with elemental water, soaking the target. If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell targeting a single creature, you soak the target of the spell with water. If the target has [[Conditions/Persistent Damage|Persistent Acid or Fire Damage]], the DC to end those conditions is reduced to 10, and the creature can attempt a flat check to end those types of persistent damage immediately. The spell gains the water trait (causing it to deal extra damage to creatures with weakness to water).
