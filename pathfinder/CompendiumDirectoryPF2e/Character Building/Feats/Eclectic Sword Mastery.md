## Feat 13
### [[concentrate]][[tengu]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Eclectic Sword Training
* * *
You instinctively learn how to use a sword with just a few practice swings. You change one of the swords designated in your [[Feats/Tengu Weapon Familiarity|Tengu Weapon Familiarity]] to a new one that you're wielding, provided the sword meets the specifications of Tengu Weapon Familiarity. You can Interact to draw a sword as part of this activity, designating the sword as part of drawing it; disrupting that Interact action prevents you from designating it as one of your swords. This designation lasts until your next daily preparations.
