# Crossblooded Evolution
## Feat 8
### [[sorcerer]]

**Category** class; 




Odd interactions in your bloodline provide you with unexpected effects. Choose another [[Class Features/Bloodline|Bloodline]]. You know the blood magic effect of that bloodline. If the blood magic effect has a variable effect based on a choice you would have made at 1st level (such as the elemental bloodline's elemental influence), you make that decision when you take this feat.
