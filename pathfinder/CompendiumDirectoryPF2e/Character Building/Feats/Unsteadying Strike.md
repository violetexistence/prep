# Unsteadying Strike `pf2:1`
## Feat 4
### [[commander]][[flourish]]

**Category** class; 




Your attack makes your opponent more susceptible to follow-up maneuvers from your allies. Make a melee Strike against an enemy within your reach. If the Strike is successful, the enemy takes a –2 circumstance penalty to their Fortitude DC to resist being Grappled, Repositioned, or Shoved and a –2 circumstance penalty to their Reflex DC to resist being Disarmed. Both penalties last until the start of your next turn.
