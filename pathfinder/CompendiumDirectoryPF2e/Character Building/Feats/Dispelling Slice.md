# Dispelling Slice `pf2:2`
## Feat 16
### [[rogue]]

**Category** class; 




Your sneak attack slices through the threads binding magic to a target. Make a Strike against an [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] creature. If your Strike deals sneak attack damage, you attempt to counteract a single spell of your choice active on the target. Your counteract rank is equal to half your level (rounded up), and your counteract check modifier is equal to your class DC â€“ 10.
