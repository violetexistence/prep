# Impressive Performance
## Feat 1
### [[general]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Performance
* * *
Your performances inspire admiration and win you fans. You can [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] using Performance instead of Diplomacy. If you spend at least 10 minutes performing in front of an audience, you can Make an Impression targeting up to 10 members of the audience who were there for the whole performance, without taking the normal penalty. The number of targets increases to 20 for a 1-hour performance and 50 for a 2-hour performance.
