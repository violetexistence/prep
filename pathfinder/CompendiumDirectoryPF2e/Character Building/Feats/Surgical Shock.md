# Surgical Shock `pf2:1`
## Feat 12
### [[attack]][[investigator]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** forensic medicine methodology
* * *
With a few well-placed jabs with your fist or weapon, you render your opponent disoriented or ungainly. Attempt a `Medicine check` check against the Fortitude DC of a target within your reach. The result of your check determines the severity of the condition you inflict.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is either [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 3]] or [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 3]] until the end of your next turn. The target is then immune to Surgical Shock for 1 hour.

**Success** As critical success, but the target is either [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 2]] or [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 2]].

**Failure** The target is minorly inconvenienced. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the next attack action you attempt against it before the end of your turn.

[[Feat_Feature Effects/Effect_ Surgical Shock (Failure)|Effect: Surgical Shock (Failure)]]

**Critical Failure** The target is unaffected and you overextend yourself, triggering reactions as if you had used a manipulate action.
