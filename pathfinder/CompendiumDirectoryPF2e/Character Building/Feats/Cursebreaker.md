Using various implements and esoteric methods, you can attempt to remove a curse from an unfortunate victim. It takes 10 minutes to perform these rites on a willing creature, who must remain within your reach the entire time.

Attempt to counteract one curse afflicting the creature; your counteract rank is half your level rounded up, and you use either your `Occultism check` or `Religion check` modifier as your counteract modifier. If the afflicted creature or the individual who placed the curse on the afflicted creature is the target of your active investigation through Pursue a Lead, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to this counteract check.

If the curse comes from a cursed item or other external source, a success indicates that the target creature can rid itself of the cursed item, but it doesn't remove the curse from the item.
