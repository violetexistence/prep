**Prerequisites** stalwart defender dedication

Stone never becomes queasy, so why should you? You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against the [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened]] condition. When you succeed at a Fortitude save to reduce your sickened value, you reduce it by 2 (or by 3 on a critical success).
