# Project Persona `pf2:1`
## Feat 5
### [[concentrate]][[gnome]][[illusion]][[primal]][[visual]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Where others etch their armor to serve as a conduit for their imaginations, your vivid mind and bold personality allow you to project a more fitting persona over your lackluster armor. You change the shape and appearance of your armor to appear as ordinary or fine clothes of your imagining. The armor's statistics don't change. This effect lasts as long as you remain conscious and are wearing the armor. A creature can disbelieve the illusion by Seeking or touching your armor. The DC equals your Will DC.
