# Scour the Library `pf2:1`
## Feat 10
### [[psyche]][[psychic]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** gathered lore subconscious mind
* * *
Seeing an enemy's attack, you quickly consult multiple scraps of lore in your mind, synthesizing them into the perfect plan. Make a check to Recall Knowledge (using an appropriate skill) about one creature within 60 feet. On a success, in addition to the normal benefits, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your next attack roll against that creature and to your AC against the creature's next attack. On a critical success, the bonuses are +2.
