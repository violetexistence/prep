# Shield Wall `pf2:r`
## Feat 6
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[champion]][[fighter]]

**Category** class; 




**Trigger** Your shield is raised and an adjacent ally Raises a Shield.

* * *

You use your shield in tandem with an ally's, forming a barricade. Both you and the triggering creature have [[Other Effects/Effect_ Cover|Standard Cover]] as long as you remain adjacent to each other and you both have your shields raised; when this is no longer the case, the effect ends. You and your ally can't use this cover to [[Actions/Hide|Hide]], as it's obvious you're standing there holding your shields, but you and your ally can use it to [[Actions/Take Cover|Take Cover]]. Normally, if you and your ally don't move, Shield Wall lasts until the beginning of your next turn, when your shield is no longer raised.
