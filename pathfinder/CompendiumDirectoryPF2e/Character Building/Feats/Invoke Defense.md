# Invoke Defense `pf2:1`
## Feat 8
### [[archetype]][[morph]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Rivethun Invoker Dedication
* * *
**Requirements** You're under the effects of [[Actions/Enter Spirit Trance|Enter Spirit Trance]].

* * *

You manifest a defensive quality of spirits all around, such as the thick hide of an animal spirit or the sturdy bark of a nature spirit. Choose bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing. You gain resistance equal to half your level to that damage type for the duration of your spirit trance.

If you use Invoke Defense again, you can choose a different type of damage, but you lose the previous resistance.
