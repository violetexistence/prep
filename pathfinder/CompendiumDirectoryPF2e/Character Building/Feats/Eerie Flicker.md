# Eerie Flicker `pf2:r`
## Feat 2
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[deviant]][[magical]]

**Category** class; 




**Trigger** An enemy's Strike would hit you and you weren't already [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]], [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]], or [[Conditions/Undetected|Undetected]] by that enemy.

* * *

Your body flickers momentarily into the Ethereal Plane. You become concealed for 1 round, and the flat check for concealment applies to the Strike that would have hit you. If the flat check fails, the Strike misses you.

* * *

**Awakening** When your body flickers, you momentarily assume a terrifying form. If a creature fails the flat check against concealment from your Eerie Flicker, it becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]], and it doesn't reduce the frightened condition from this effect at the end of the same turn it gained the condition.

* * *

**Awakening** You can choose to compress your flickering movement into a single moment, increasing your chance to avoid the triggering attack in exchange for a shorter-lived effect. If you choose to do so, the flat check for concealment against the triggering attack increases to `DC 9 Flat check`, but the concealment affects only the triggering Strike.
