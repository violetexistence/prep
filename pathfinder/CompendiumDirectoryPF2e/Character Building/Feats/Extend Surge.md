### [[concentrate]][[mythic]]

**Category** class;

**Requirements** Your [[Spells/Spellsurge|Spellsurge]] aura is active.

You tap deeper into the vortex of magical energy within you. Until the start of your next turn, the radius of your _spellsurge_ aura increases to 30 feet. If you spend a Mythic Point as part of this action, the radius increases to 60 feet instead until the start of your next turn and is then 30 feet for the duration of the spell.
