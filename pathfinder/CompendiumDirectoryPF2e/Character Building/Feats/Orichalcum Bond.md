# Orichalcum Bond
## Feat 18
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Rod of Rule
* * *
The ancient Thassilonians associated sins with different skymetals, and you've adapted that theory to empower your bonded weapon beyond its normal limits. When your personal rune is placed on a weapon during your daily preparations, choose a weapon property rune of up to your level that is common or you otherwise have access to. That rune is also added to the weapon until your next daily preparations. This rune counts against your weapon's limit as normal.
