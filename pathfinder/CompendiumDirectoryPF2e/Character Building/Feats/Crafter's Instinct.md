# Crafter's Instinct `pf2:r`
## Feat 13
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[dwarf]][[fortune]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** master in Crafting
* * *
**Access** You are from Dongun Hold or Alkenstar.

**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** You misfire with a firearm or you roll a failure on a Strike with a ranged weapon.

* * *

You sense a minor flaw in the weapon as you fire it, and quickly adjust your aim on the fly to avoid the flaw. If the triggering Strike was a misfire, you get a normal failure instead. If the triggering Strike was a failure, it becomes a glancing blow that deals minimum damage for the Strike (adding any bonuses as normal but getting a result of 1 for all damage dice that would be rolled on a success). The glancing blow does not apply other effects that would normally happen only on a hit.
