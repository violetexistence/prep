# Never Tire `pf2:r`
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Celebrity Dedication
* * *
**Trigger** You would gain the [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]] condition.

**Requirements** You are [[Conditions/Observed|Observed]] by at least three creatures who aren't enemies.

* * *

As long as you have an audience, you can continue to perform even when you are on the brink of collapse. Indeed, you mustâ€”you have an obligation to your fans! You delay the effects of the [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]] condition for 1 minute or until you are no longer observed by at least three creatures who aren't enemies, whichever comes first. If the fatigued condition has a duration, the duration begins to elapse only after the delay. You can't further delay or prevent the fatigued condition after this ability ends.
