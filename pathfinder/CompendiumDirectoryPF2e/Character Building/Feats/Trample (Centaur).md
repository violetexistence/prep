# Trample (Centaur) `pf2:3`
## Feat 13
### [[centaur]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You've trained to stampede right over smaller foes without causing yourself any harm. Stride up to double your Speed; you can move through the spaces of creatures at least one size smaller, Trampling each creature whose space you enter. You can attempt to Trample the same creature only once in a single Trample. You deal bludgeoning damage equal to your hoof attack (or your unarmed strike if you lack a hoof attack) against these creatures, who can attempt a `Reflex check` save against your class DC.
