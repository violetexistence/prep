# Smoke Through Bamboo
## Feat 5
### [[sarangay]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** new moon sarangay
* * *
You've spent significant time slipping silently between bamboo thickets, and your light-footedness allows you to navigate even the thickest forests and brush with ease. When you Step, you can move 10 feet instead of 5. This enables you to Step into and within difficult terrain as long as you can meet the extra movement cost.
