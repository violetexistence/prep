Your fame has spread throughout the lands. Creatures who have any listed skill in Society have heard of you and usually have an attitude toward you one step better than normal, depending on your reputation and the creature's disposition. For instance, if you're well-known for cruel and demanding behavior, creatures might be intimidated by you, rather than be friendly toward you. When you [[Actions/Earn Income|Earn Income]] with Performance, you attract higher-level audiences than your location would allow, as audiences flock to see you. For instance, rulers and angels might travel to your small tower in the woods to hear you perform. Typically, this increases the audiences available to your level or by two levels, whichever is higher.
