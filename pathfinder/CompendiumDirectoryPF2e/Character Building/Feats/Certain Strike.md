# Certain Strike `pf2:1`
## Feat 10
### [[fighter]][[press]]

**Category** class; 




Even when you don't hit squarely, you can still score a glancing blow. Make a melee Strike. It gains the following failure effect.

**Failure** Your attack deals any damage it would have dealt on a hit, excluding all damage dice. (This removes damage dice from weapon runes, spells, and special abilities, in addition to weapon damage dice.)
