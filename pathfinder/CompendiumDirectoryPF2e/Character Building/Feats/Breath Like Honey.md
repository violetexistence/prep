You smell of honey and savory things. Your circumstance bonus to checks to [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] if the target can smell your breath increases to +2. In addition, you can cast [[Spells/Enthrall|Enthrall]] as a 3rd-rank occult innate spell once per day, except the spell has a range of 30 feet and the olfactory trait instead of the auditory trait. Targets don't gain any circumstance bonus for disagreeing with you.
