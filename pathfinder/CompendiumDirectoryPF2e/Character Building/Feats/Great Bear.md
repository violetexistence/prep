# Great Bear
## Feat 12
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Ursine Avenger Form
* * *
**Frequency** once per hour

When you transform, you can take on a bear's bulk and size. You can spend an additional action when using Ursine Avenger Form to gain the effects of a 1st-rank [[Spells/Enlarge|Enlarge]] spell, which lasts for the spell's normal duration or until you leave your Ursine Avenger Form, whichever comes first.
