# Fresh Produce `pf2:1`
## Feat 1
### [[healing]][[impulse]][[kineticist]][[plant]][[primal]][[vitality]][[wood]]

**Category** class; 




You grow a nourishing nut, vegetable, seed, or fruit. Choose a creature in your kinetic aura. The produce grows in their open hand, or at their feet if they have no open hands. The produce has light Bulk. A creature can eat it with an Interact action to regain 1d4+(floor((max(1,1)-1)/2)\*5+1 vitality healing HP; this is a healing vitality effect. The creature feels full for 10 minutes, during which it has resistance 2 to void damage and can't eat another piece of produce. Produce not consumed by the start of your next turn withers away.
