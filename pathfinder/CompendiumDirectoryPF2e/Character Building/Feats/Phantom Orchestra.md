An easy way to trick others is to throw your voice into a nearby forest or thicket to make strange noises. You can cast 2nd-rank [[Spells/Ventriloquism|Ventriloquism]] as an innate primal spell once per day. You can also cast the [[Spells/Figment|Figment]] cantrip as a primal innate spell at will, heightened to a spell rank equal to half your level rounded up.
