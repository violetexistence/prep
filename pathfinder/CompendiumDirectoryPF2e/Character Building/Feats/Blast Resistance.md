# Blast Resistance
## Feat 5
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[dwarf]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Access** You are from Dongun Hold or Alkenstar.

* * *

You're used to the clamor of steel, the crack of a firearm, and the thunderous blast of explosions. You gain resistance 3 to fire and sonic. If you roll a success on a saving throw against an effect that causes the [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] or [[Conditions/Deafened|Deafened]] conditions, you get a critical success instead.
