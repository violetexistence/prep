# Cooperative Soul
## Feat 9
### [[human]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You have developed a soul-deep bond with your comrades and maintain an even greater degree of cooperation with them. If you are at least an expert in the skill you are [[Actions/Aid|Aiding]], when you roll a failure or critical failure to Aid a skill check, you get a success instead.
