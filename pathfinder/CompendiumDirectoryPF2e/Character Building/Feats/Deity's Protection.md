# Deity's Protection
## Feat 14
### [[cleric]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Advanced Domain
* * *
When you call upon your deity's power to fulfill the promise of their domain, you gain divine protection. After you cast a domain spell, you gain resistance to all damage until the start of your next turn. The amount of resistance is equal to the rank of the domain spell you cast.
