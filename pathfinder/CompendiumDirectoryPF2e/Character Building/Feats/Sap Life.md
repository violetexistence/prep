# Sap Life
## Feat 2
### [[cleric]][[healing]]

**Category** class; 




You draw the life force out of your enemies. When you cast a [[Spells/Harm|Harm]] spell and damage at least one living creature, you regain Hit Points equal to the spell rank of your _harm_ spell. If you aren't a living creature, you gain no benefit from this feat.
