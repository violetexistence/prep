**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Energize Wings
* * *
Your wings have grown to their full, majestic form, granting you the unlimited power of flight. You have a fly Speed of 25 feet at all times. Furthermore, sprites recognize you as a powerful hero (or villain) by your unique wings and are appropriately impressed. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus on all Diplomacy and Intimidation checks against sprites and gain the benefits of the [[Feats/Glad-Hand|Glad-Hand]] skill feat against other sprites, without taking a â€“5 penalty to your Diplomacy check.
