# Battle Medicine `pf2:1`
## Feat 1
### [[general]][[healing]][[manipulate]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Medicine
* * *
**Requirements** You're holding or wearing a healer's toolkit.

* * *

You can patch up wounds, even in combat. Attempt a Medicine check with the same DC as for [[Actions/Treat Wounds|Treat Wounds]] and restore the corresponding amount of HP; this doesn't remove the wounded condition. As with Treat Wounds, you can attempt checks against higher DCs if you have the minimum proficiency rank. The target is then [[Feat_Feature Effects/Effect_ Battle Medicine Immunity|immune]] to your Battle Medicine for 1 day. This does not make them immune to, or otherwise count as, Treat Wounds.
