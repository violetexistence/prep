# Blasting Beams `pf2:1`
## Feat 2
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[attack]][[deviant]][[magical]]

**Category** class; 




**Requirements** You have a free hand.

* * *

A directed beam of heat or an arc of lightning is one of the simplest ways to project energy. You fire a blast or beam from one hand. Make an attack roll against a creature within 30 feet. If you succeed, the beam deals 1d6 damage for every 2 levels you have to the target, or double damage on a critical success.

* * *

**Awakening** Your beams blast through targets. Instead of making an attack roll to damage a single creature within 30 feet, you can use Blasting Beams as a 2-action activity to damage all creatures in a 60-foot line, with a `Reflex check` save.

* * *

**Awakening** You can choose to launch smaller, quicker beams from your eyes instead. These deal d4s instead of d6s, but the attack has the agile trait, and you don't need a hand free to make it, though your eyes must be uncovered.
