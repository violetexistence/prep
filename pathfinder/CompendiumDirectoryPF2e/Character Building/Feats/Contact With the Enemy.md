# Contact With the Enemy
## Feat 14
### [[commander]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Adaptive Stratagem
* * *
You know that even the best-laid plans rarely survive contact with the enemy, and you have prepared your allies to adapt with a wide array of contingencies. When you use Adaptive Stratagem, you can replace any master tactics or legendary tactics you have prepared with any other tactics in your folio.
