# Deadly Butterfly
## Feat 8
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Butterfly Blade Dedication
* * *
You gain access to the butterfly sword's critical specialization effect. If you already had access to the critical specialization effect or you gain the effect at a later time, you also gain the critical specialization effect for knives when you critically hit with a butterfly sword. You can benefit from only one critical specialization effect at a time.
