# Efficient Rituals
## Feat 8
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Ritualist Dedication
* * *
You can perform particularly extensive rituals in less time. If the ritual normally requires 1 day to cast, you can cast it in 4 hours. If it takes longer than 1 day, you cast it in half the number of days, rounded up.

At 14th level, if a ritual has a casting time measured in days, you can cast it in an equal number of hours. If this results in a ritual longer than 8 hours, you split the ritual between multiple days, as normal for a ritual.
