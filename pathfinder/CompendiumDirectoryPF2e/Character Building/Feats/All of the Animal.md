# All of the Animal
## Feat 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[general]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Survival
* * *
You know how to make the best and most efficient use of a hunted animal's carcass. Choose a Large or larger corpse of an animal that died within the past day. While using Survival to [[Actions/Subsist|Subsist]] near the carcass, you always receive enough food for yourself and one additional Medium creature, using up the meat from the carcass to do so. Since you're using all of the animal, others can't use the carcass's meat for any other purpose, including their own use of All of the Animal.
