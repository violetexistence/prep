The restorative power of your healing invigorates the recipient. If the next action you use is to cast [[Spells/Heal|Heal]] targeting a single living creature and the target regains Hit Points from the spell, the target also gains three bonuses until the end of its next turn: a +5-foot status bonus to its Speed, a +1 status bonus to attack rolls, and a +1 status bonus to damage rolls. In addition, if the target is [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]], it can immediately Stand as a free action that doesn't trigger reactions.
