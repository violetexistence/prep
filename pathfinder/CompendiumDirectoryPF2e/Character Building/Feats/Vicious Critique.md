# Vicious Critique `pf2:0`
## Feat 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[general]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Crafting and Intimidation
* * *
**Trigger** You are about to attempt to [[Actions/Coerce|Coerce]] a merchant or crafter.

* * *

You have an eye for detail and a mouth for pointing out flaws, which makes it all the easier to convince the merchants and crafters of King's Heart to help you. You quickly analyze the triggering creature's wares in hopes of finding something useful in your coercion and attempt a Crafting check.

* * *

**Critical Success** You have plenty to work with and can leave your target shocked with your analysis. If you a roll a success on your Intimidation check, you get a critical success instead. If you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead.

**Success** As critical success, but you only gain the benefits when rolling a success on your Intimidation check.

**Failure** You misjudge the wares, which makes you come across as unknowledgeable and less intimidating. You take a –1 circumstance penalty to your Intimidation check to Coerce.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the penalty is –2.
