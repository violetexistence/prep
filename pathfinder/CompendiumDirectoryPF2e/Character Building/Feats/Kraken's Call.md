# Kraken's Call `pf2:3`
## Feat 17
### [[concentrate]][[manipulate]][[merfolk]][[primal]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per day

* * *

You call forth the sleeping krakens of the deep to crush your enemies. You open a dozen small portals to some lightless, watery abyss in a 30-foot burst within 120 feet. The powerful tentacles of a kraken reach through to grab at each creature in the area. Each affected creature takes 8d6 untyped damage depending on its `Fortitude check` save against the higher of your class DC or spell DC. You can Sustain the call up to 1 minute. The first time you Sustain it on each subsequent turn, each creature in the area not already [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] by the tentacles must attempt the save.

* * *

**Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Failure** The creature takes full damage and is grabbed by a tentacle. A creature that's still grabbed by a tentacle at the end of its turn takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage. The tentacles' [[Actions/Escape|Escape]] DC and AC are both equal to the higher of your class DC or spell DC. A creature can attack a tentacle to attempt to free the creature trapped by it; a tentacle is destroyed if it takes 30 or more damage in a single round.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but double damage.
