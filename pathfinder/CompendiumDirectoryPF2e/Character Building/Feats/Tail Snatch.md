# Tail Snatch `pf2:1`
## Feat 5
### [[vanara]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You can whip your tail around to lash items from the unwary's grip. You attempt to [[Actions/Disarm|Disarm]] a creature, ignoring the requirement that you must have at least one hand free. As normal, your tail can't hold the items it disarms.
