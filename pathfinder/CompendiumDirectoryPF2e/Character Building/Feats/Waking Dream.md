While in your trance, you can blur the line between dreams and reality for others. You gain the [[Spells/Waking Dream|Waking Dream]] focus spell, which you can use only while you're in a Daydream Trance. You gain a pool of Focus Points with 1 Focus Point and you can Refocus by taking a nap for 10 minutes. You become trained in occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs, and your spellcasting ability for these spells is Wisdom.
