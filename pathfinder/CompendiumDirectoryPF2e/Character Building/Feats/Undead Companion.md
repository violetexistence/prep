# Undead Companion
## Feat 5
### [[dhampir]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** an animal companion or familiar
* * *
Your companion is also touched by undeath, a mix of a traditional companion and a skeleton, zombie, or stranger form of unlife. Your companion gains the undead trait instead of the animal trait and gains void healing. It otherwise uses the normal rules for an animal companion or familiar; that means it can still be affected by many conditions or effects to which most undead are immune.
