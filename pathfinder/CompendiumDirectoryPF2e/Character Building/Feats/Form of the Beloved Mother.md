# Form of the Beloved Mother
## Feat 17
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[nagaji]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Access** Tian Xia origin or follower of Nalinivati

* * *

You channel the blessings of Nalinivati to transform into a manifestation of her will. You can cast 5th-rank [[Spells/Animal Form|Animal Form]] as an occult innate spell once per day, but you can choose only snake form with the spell. You can spend an additional action casting _animal form_ to also cast 5th-rank [[Spells/Slither|Slither]] centered on your location; Nalinivati's will ensures that the shadow snakes created by the spell never harm you, so you're unaffected by the spell. If you Dismiss animal form, the effects of _slither_ end as well.
