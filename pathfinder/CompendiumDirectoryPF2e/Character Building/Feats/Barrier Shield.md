# Barrier Shield
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Spell Trickster Dedication; ability to cast shield
* * *
When you cast [[Spells/Shield|Shield]], you can modify the spell to create a solid barrier you can use for [[Other Effects/Effect_ Cover|Cover]], but not for blocking. You can't use the [[Feats/Shield Block|Shield Block]] reaction when the spell is modified in this way, but you (and only you) can spend an action to [[Actions/Take Cover|Take Cover]] to gain standard cover from it.
