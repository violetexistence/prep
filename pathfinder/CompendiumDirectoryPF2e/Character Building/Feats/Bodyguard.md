# Bodyguard
## Feat 1
### [[guardian]]

**Category** class; 




You swear a vow to protect one of your allies at all costs, regardless of the risk this might pose to you. During your daily preparations, choose one of your allies as your charge. When you Taunt, the penalty your taunted enemy takes increases to â€“2 against your charge.

You can take 10 minutes to change who your charge is before your next daily preparations.
