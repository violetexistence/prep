# Shackleborn
## Feat 1
### [[lineage]][[nephilim]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Your lineage shows the signs of velstrac tampering, including some curious quirk bequeathed by those shadowy surgeons of flesh and souls. Your flesh heals cleanly and quicklyâ€”all the better for you to serve as a subject for their ghastly art. You gain the [[Feats/Fast Recovery|Fast Recovery]] feat, even if you don't meet the prerequisites.
