# Spiteful Rake `pf2:2`
## Feat 13
### [[changeling]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Claw Unarmed Attack
* * *
**Requirements** You have both hands free.

* * *

Your instincts sing of spite and malice, and you've learned a devastating trick: go for the eyes. You make a claw Strike. If you hit and deal damage, the target is [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] for 1 round. On a critical hit, the target is instead [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] for 1 round and dazzled until restored to maximum hit points.
