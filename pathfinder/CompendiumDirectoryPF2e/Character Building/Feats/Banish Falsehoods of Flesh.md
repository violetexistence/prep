# Banish Falsehoods of Flesh `pf2:1`
## Feat 14
### [[animist]][[concentrate]][[divine]]

**Category** class; 




Your ability to manipulate supernatural energy allows you to deploy divine magic directly against a disguised enemy to reveal them as they truly are, or to cleanse an ally from an unwilling transformation. Attempt a `Religion check` check to counteract a polymorph effect currently affecting a creature within 30 feet of you that you are aware of. The target is then temporarily immune to Banish Falsehoods of Flesh for 1 day.
