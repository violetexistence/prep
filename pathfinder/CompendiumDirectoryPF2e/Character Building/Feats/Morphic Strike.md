You can lash out with a portion of your previous self. You gain a melee unarmed Strike depending on your heritage, described below. You can use this unarmed Strike in either your humanoid form or your yaoguai form. These Strikes are in the brawling group. Like other unarmed attacks, you can improve this attack with handwraps of mighty blows.

*   **Celestial** `pf2:1` spirit touch (magical, sanctified, spirit), Damage 1d4 spirit
*   **Elements** `pf2:1` elemental current (magical), Damage 1d4; this ability deals the same damage type and gains the same elemental traits of the cantrip you gained from your heritage
