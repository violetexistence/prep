# Glad-Hand
## Feat 2
### [[general]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** expert in Diplomacy
* * *
First impressions are your strong suit. When you meet someone in a casual or social situation, you can immediately attempt a Diplomacy check to [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] on that creature rather than needing to converse for 1 minute. If you fail, you can engage in 1 minute of conversation and attempt a new check at the end of that time rather than accepting the failure or critical failure result.
