### [[flourish]][[swashbuckler]]

You dash past an opponent, confounding them with underhanded tactics. Stride up to half your speed. You can attempt a [[Actions/Trip|Trip]] or a [[Feats/Dirty Trick|Dirty Trick]] (if you have that action) against one opponent you pass within range of at any point during your movement.
