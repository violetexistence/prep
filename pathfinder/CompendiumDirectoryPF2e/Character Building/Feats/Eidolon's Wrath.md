# Eidolon's Wrath
## Feat 6
### [[evolution]][[summoner]]

**Category** class; 




Your eidolon gains the [[Spells/Eidolon's Wrath|Eidolon's Wrath]] focus spell, which it casts, instead of you. You determine the damage type when you gain the feat: acid, cold, electricity, fire, sonic, vitality, or void. If your eidolon is a celestial, fiend, or monitor with an alignment other than true neutral, you can choose a damage type in its alignment.

Increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1. As normal, your eidolon shares your Focus Points.
