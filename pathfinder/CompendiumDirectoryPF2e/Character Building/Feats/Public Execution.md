# Public Execution `pf2:1`
## Feat 8
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[archetype]][[auditory]][[flourish]][[linguistic]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Assassin Dedication
* * *
**Requirements** You have designated a mark using [[Actions/Mark for Death|Mark for Death]].

* * *

Some rebel Firebrand cells make a practice of publicly declaring the main target of a given operation. You announce your intention to kill your mark for all to hear and reveal the reason they must die, perhaps listing their crimes or sharing a damning secret. Creatures within 30 feet who can see and hear you are shocked by your proclamation or otherwise reluctant to come to your mark's aid. They must attempt a `Will check` save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. On a failure, the creature can't attack you or otherwise perform hostile actions against you until the end of your next turn. If you use a hostile action against a creature other than your mark, this effect ends. Your mark becomes temporarily immune to your Public Execution for 1 day.
