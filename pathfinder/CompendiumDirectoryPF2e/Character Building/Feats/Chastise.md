# Chastise `pf2:2`
## Feat 16
### [[archetype]][[concentrate]][[sanctified]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Fear of God
* * *
With but a mere word from your deity, you exploit a foe's fear to see their inner being brought low. You chastise the spirit of a foe within 30 feet that has the frightened condition. The target must attempt a `Will check` saving throw against the higher of your class DC or spell DC. The target is then temporarily immune for 1 hour.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target takes 2 persistent spirit damage. The first time the creature fails their flat check to recover from this, the persistent spirit damage doubles.

**Failure** The target takes 4 persistent spirit damage. The first time the creature fails their flat check to recover from this, the persistent spirit damage doubles.

**Critical Failure** The target takes 6 persistent spirit damage. The first time the creature fails their flat check to recover from this, the persistent spirit damage doubles.
