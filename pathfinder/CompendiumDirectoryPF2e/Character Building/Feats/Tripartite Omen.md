# Tripartite Omen
## Feat 18
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Dualistic Synergy; Shattered Sacrament; master in Religion
* * *
You invoke religious portents to ward yourself against danger without losing sight of the history that led to this point. When you use [[Feats/Dualistic Synergy|Dualistic Synergy]], if your next action is to Cast a Spell from your spell slots and that spell is divine, you gain a +1 status bonus to AC for 1 round. If the spell is a halcyon spell, you gain this benefit in addition to the benefits described in Dualistic Synergy.
