# Electrogenesis `pf2:2`
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]][[electricity]][[primal]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Wild Mimic Dedication; you have seen a creature deal electricity damage with an unarmed Strike or have identified a creature capable of dealing electricity damage with an unarmed Strike in combat
* * *
**Frequency** once per 10 minutes

* * *

Some animals and beasts have electric organs in their body that they can use to jolt their prey. You may not have the requisite physiology to do the same, but a touch of primal magic can achieve the same effect. Make a melee unarmed Strike against a creature. If the Strike hits, it deals an additional 1d12 electricity damage, and the creature must make a `Fortitude check` save against the higher of your class DC or spell DC.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature is [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] for 1 round.

**Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 2]] for 1 round.

**Critical Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 3]] for 1 round.
