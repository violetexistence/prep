# Mated Birds in Paired Flight
## Feat 10
### [[exemplar]][[ikon]]

**Category** class; 




**Usage** imbued in one or two weapon ikons that both have the thrown trait (see text)

* * *

Your ikons bond like a pair of one-winged birds. This feat can be imbued in either a single ikon with multiple copies, such as one produced by the [[Class Features/Shadow Sheath|Shadow Sheath]] or with the [[Feats/Twin Stars|Twin Stars]] feat, or two separate ikons (bypassing the normal limit per ikon feat).

**Immanence** As long as you hold one ikon, the other will return to find its partner. Both ikons gain the returning rune.
