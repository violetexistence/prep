# Dueling Acumen
## Feat 2
### [[archetype]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** Aldori Duelist Dedication
* * *
You're always ready for a new duel, and you've been trained to start and end fights quickly. When you're in a duel or can see exactly one creature, you can always roll Dueling Lore for initiative. If you do so while in a duel, you must choose from either Deception, Intimidation, or Perception when you roll for initiative; you're considered to have rolled the chosen skill for initiative for the purpose of dueling actions.
