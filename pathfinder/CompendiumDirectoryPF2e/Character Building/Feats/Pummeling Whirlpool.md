# Pummeling Whirlpool `pf2:2`
## Feat 13
### [[concentrate]][[manipulate]][[merfolk]][[primal]][[water]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per day

You draw water from the environs, swirling it into a rough torrent around you to punish your foes. Each creature in a 10-foot emanation (or 15 feet if you're in a body of water) takes 8d6 bludgeoning damage with a `Reflex check` save against the higher of your class DC or spell DC. A creature that fails its save is knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]. At 17th level, the damage increases to 11d6.
