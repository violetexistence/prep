# Climate Adaptation
## Feat 5
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[leshy]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Like evergreen trees, which stay healthy and vibrant from winter through summer, you too can adapt to a variety of extreme climates. You're unaffected by mild cold or heat environmental effects, and when you're in severe cold or heat, you take the effects of mild cold or heat instead. This doesn't protect you from extreme or incredible cold or heat.
