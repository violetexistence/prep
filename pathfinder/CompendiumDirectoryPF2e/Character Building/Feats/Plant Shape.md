# Plant Shape
## Feat 10
### [[druid]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** leaf order or Untamed Form
* * *
You can take the shape of a plant creature. If you don't have untamed form, you can cast [[Spells/Plant Form|Plant Form]] once per day, heightened to the same rank as your highest-rank druid spell slot.

If you do have [[Feats/Untamed Form|Untamed Form]], add the shapes listed in [[Spells/Plant Form|Plant Form]] to your [[Spells/Untamed Form|Untamed Form]] list, and whenever you're polymorphed into another shape using untamed form, you gain resistance 5 to poison.
