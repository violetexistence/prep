# Goring Charge `pf2:2`
## Feat 9
### [[minotaur]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Driven by the momentum of your thundering steps and powerful mass, your horns can pierce your foes. Stride twice, then make a horns Strike. If you moved at least 20 feet from your starting position, your horns Strike also deals 1d6 persistent bleed damage.
