# Dashing Strike `pf2:1`
## Feat 12
### [[fighter]][[press]]

**Category** class; 




**Requirements** You are adjacent to an enemy.

* * *

Springing away from one foe, you Strike at another. Stride up to your Speed, but you must end that movement within melee reach of a different enemy. At the end of your movement, make a melee Strike against an enemy now within reach. You can use Dashing Strike while Burrowing, Climbing, Flying, or Swimming instead of Striding if you have the corresponding movement type.
