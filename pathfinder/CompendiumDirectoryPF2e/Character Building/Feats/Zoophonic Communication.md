Your studies have expanded your ability to parley and negotiate into the animal realm. You can [[Actions/request skill=performance|request skill=performance]]{Request} from animals using Performance instead of Diplomacy as though you shared a language, although this gives you no special ability to understand their responses. You can also use Performance instead of Nature to [[Actions/command-an-animal skill=performance|command-an-animal skill=performance]]{Command an Animal}.
