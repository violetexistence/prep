# Intimidating Glare
## Feat 1
### [[general]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Intimidation
* * *
You can [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] with a mere glare. When you do, Demoralize loses the auditory trait and gains the visual trait, and you don't take a penalty if the creature doesn't understand your language.
