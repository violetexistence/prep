## Feat 4
### [[guardian]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Hampering Stance

**Trigger** A creature within your reach leaves a square during a move action it's using.

**Requirements** You are in [[Feats/Hampering Stance|Hampering Stance]].

You lash out when foes try to get past you, possibly stopping them in their tracks. Make a melee Strike against the triggering creature. The Strike gains the following additional results.

**Critical Success** The target's movement is disrupted.

**Success** The target takes a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speed for the rest of its triggering movement. This penalty might cause the triggering creature's movement to end immediately based on its affected Speed.
