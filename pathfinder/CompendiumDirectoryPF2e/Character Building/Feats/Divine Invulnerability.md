# Divine Invulnerability `pf2:1`
## Feat 14
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[mythic]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Godling Dedication
* * *
**Frequency** once per day

* * *

Though you are not yet a god, you can invoke a measure of omnipotence that makes you high invulnerable. Spend a Mythic Point. You gain resistance to all damage equal to half your level for 1 minute as your aura smolders with power.

During this time, if you cast a domain spell you received from this destiny, this resistance increases to equal your level until the beginning of your next turn.
