# Dragon Transformation `pf2:1`
## Feat 16
### [[barbarian]][[concentrate]][[polymorph]][[primal]][[rage]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Dragon's Rage Wings
* * *
You transform into a ferocious Large dragon, gaining the effects of 6th-rank [[Spells/Dragon Form|Dragon Form]] except that you use your own AC and attack modifier, you apply your extra damage from [[Actions/Rage|Rage]], and the Dragon Breath action uses your class DC. Add the temporary Hit Points from dragon form to any you already have from entering a rage (or any other action with the rage trait). The action to Dismiss the transformation gains the rage trait.

At 18th level, you gain a +20-foot status bonus to your fly Speed, your damage bonus with dragon Strikes increases to +12, and you gain a +14 status bonus to your Dragon Breath damage.
