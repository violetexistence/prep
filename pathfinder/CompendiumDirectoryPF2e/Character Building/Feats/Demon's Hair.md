# Demon's Hair
## Feat 20
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[witch]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Living Hair
* * *
Your hair constantly wriggles and writhes like that of your rival, Syu Tak-nwa. Your damage die of your hair unarmed Strike increases by one step and it gains the reach and versatile slashing traits. Your familiar assumes partial control over your hair; as long as your familiar is alive and within 30 feet, you are permanently quickened, and you can use the extra action only to make a hair Strike.

You can deliver hexes through your hair. When you successfully cast a non-cantrip hex that requires 2 or more actions to cast and that doesn't require a spell attack roll, if your target is within your reach, as part of the spellcasting activity you can make a hair Strike against them before applying any effects of the hex. If this Strike misses, the hex has no effect.

**Special** If your hair already has the reach trait, it instead gains the sweep trait.
