# Point Blank Stance `pf2:1`
## Feat 1
### [[fighter]][[stance]]

**Category** class; 




**Requirements** You are wielding a ranged weapon.

* * *

You take aim to pick off nearby enemies quickly. When using a ranged volley weapon while you are in this stance, you don't take the penalty to your attack rolls from the volley trait. When using a ranged weapon that doesn't have the volley trait, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to damage rolls on attacks against targets within the weapon's first range increment.
