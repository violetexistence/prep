# Eye for Treasure
## Feat 1
### [[dwarf]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You know good artisanship when you see it and can wax poetic about crafting techniques and forms.

You become trained in Crafting and gain a +1 circumstance bonus on all Crafting checks made to [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]]. If you would automatically become trained in Crafting (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.

In addition, you gain the [[Feats/Crafter's Appraisal|Crafter's Appraisal]] skill feat, enabling you to identify magic items using the Crafting skill.
