# Channel the Godmind `pf2:2`
## Feat 17
### [[nephilim]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Aeonbound
* * *
**Frequency** once per day

* * *

You tap into the collective consciousness of the Godmind, the governing entity of axiomite society, to rapidly parse near-infinite variables to read your surroundings. For 1 minute, you gain precise motion sense out to 60 feet, you can see [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]] creatures and objects, and you gain the benefits of [[Spells/Truesight|Truesight]] (with a counteract check modifier equal to your Perception modifier).
