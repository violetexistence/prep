# Raging Thrower
## Feat 1
### [[barbarian]]

**Category** class; 




Thrown weapons become especially deadly in your fury. You apply the additional damage from [[Actions/Rage|Rage]] to your thrown weapon attacks. If you have the [[Feats/Brutal Critical|Brutal Critical]] feat or the [[Class Features/Devastator|Devastator]] class feature, apply their benefits to thrown weapon attacks.
