# Illuminating Stories
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]][[divine]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Campfire Chronicler Dedication
* * *
Stories serve as beacons in the night, illuminating valuable knowledge even if the tale itself misses the mark. When you [[Actions/Offer Story|Offer a Story]] about any topic, you can choose that illumination in place of the normal benefits of Offer Story. You receive a +1 status bonus on checks to [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] for the duration and can Recall Knowledge about the topic of the story as a free action. The creature you share a story with can choose this benefit even if you did not.

The bonus increases to +2 if you are a master of Religion and +3 if you are legendary.
