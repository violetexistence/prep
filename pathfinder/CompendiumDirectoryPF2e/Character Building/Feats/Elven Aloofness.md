# Elven Aloofness
## Feat 1
### [[elf]]

**Category** ancestry; 




As much as you might care for them, you've come to terms with the ephemeral nature of non-elves, and it makes their threats feel less troublesome.

If a non-elf rolls a failure on a check to [[Actions/Coerce|Coerce]] you using Intimidation, it gets a critical failure instead (and thus can't try to Coerce you again for 1 week).

When a non-elf attempts to [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] you, you become temporarily immune for 1 day, instead of 10 minutes.
