# Peerless Mascot Companion
## Feat 16
### [[commander]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Battle-Hardened Companion
* * *
As veterans of countless battles, you and your companion share an indomitable strength. The companion you gained with Commander's Companion is now a specialized animal companion. You can select one of the usual specializations or the peerless mascot specialization. A commander's companion with the peerless mascot specialization gains the following benefits.

*   It gains a 30-foot aura that grants the same benefits as your banner, effectively acting as a second banner. If you have your actual banner affixed to your companion, the aura is a single 60-foot aura (this includes the increased aura benefit from Battle-Tested Companion). If you later gain the Glorious Banner feat, your banner has a 100-foot aura while it is affixed to your peerless mascot companion.
*   It gains the beast trait.
*   Its Intelligence modifier increases by 2 and its Wisdom modifier increases by 1.
*   It is an expert in Warfare Lore.
*   It can speak one language that you also speak (chosen at the time you gain this feat).
*   Its maximum Hit Points increase by 20, increasing to 25 at 18th level, and 30 at 20th level.
*   Its mastery of all kinds of battlefields grants it a climb Speed and swim Speed equal to its land Speed; if it already had a Speed that was greater than its land Speed, then it has a climb Speed, swim Speed, and land Speed that are all equal to the highest Speed it has.
