# Artisanal Crafter
## Feat 1
### [[minotaur]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Like many minotaurs, you take pride in creating items made from stone or metal. You become trained in Crafting (or another skill of your choice, if you're already trained in Crafting) and gain the [[Feats/Specialty Crafting|Specialty Crafting]] skill feat in your choice of blacksmithing, leatherworking, or stonemasonry.
