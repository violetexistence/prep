# Tremor `pf2:2`
## Feat 1
### [[earth]][[impulse]][[kineticist]][[overflow]][[primal]]

**Category** class; 




You unleash a small, localized tremor in a 10-foot burst within 30 feet. Each creature in the area takes 1d8 bludgeoning damage with a `Fortitude check` save against your class DC. A creature that critically fails is knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]. Earth and stone in the area is difficult terrain until the start of your next turn.

* * *

**Level (+2)** The damage increases by 1d8.
