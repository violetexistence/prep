# Knockback Strike `pf2:2`
## Feat 10
### [[concentrate]][[monk]]

**Category** class; 




You focus your strength into a blow powerful enough to push an enemy away from you. Make an unarmed Strike. If you hit, attempt an Athletics check to [[Actions/Shove|Shove]] the target. This attack uses the same multiple attack penalty as your Strike, and doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty.
