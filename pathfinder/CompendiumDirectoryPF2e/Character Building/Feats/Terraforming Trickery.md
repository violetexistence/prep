### [[concentrate]][[earth]][[sorcerer]]

**Category** class; 




You know how to channel the transformative aspects of your blood magic to alter your surroundings. You know the following blood magic effect.

**Blood Magicâ€”Terraforming Trickery** Either each space adjacent to you becomes difficult terrain, or each space adjacent to you is no longer difficult terrain. This doesn't have any effect on greater difficult terrain and doesn't remove the damaging effects of hazardous terrain.
