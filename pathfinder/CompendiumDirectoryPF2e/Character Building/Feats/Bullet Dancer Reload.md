## Feat 10
### [[archetype]][[flourish]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Bullet Dancer Burn
* * *
**Requirements** You're in [[Actions/Bullet Dancer Stance|Bullet Dancer Stance]].

* * *

You've learned to reload your firearms with uncanny grace, the ammunition simply falling into place as though part of a well-practiced kata. You Strike with a simple firearm, and then Interact to reload that same firearm. You don't need a free hand to reload your weapon in this way.
