# Deepest Wellspring
## Feat 18
### [[psychic]]

**Category** class; 




You've glimpsed the furthest recesses of your mind. If you have spent at least 3 Focus Points since the last time you Refocused, you recover 3 Focus Points when you Refocus, even if you spent your Focus Points on spells other than psychic abilities.
