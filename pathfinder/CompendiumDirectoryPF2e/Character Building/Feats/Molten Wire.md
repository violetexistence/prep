# Molten Wire `pf2:2`
## Feat 6
### [[attack]][[composite]][[fire]][[impulse]][[kineticist]][[metal]][[primal]]

**Category** class; 




Spinning molten iron through a vortex of fire, you trap your foe in searing wires. Make an impulse attack roll against a creature within 15 feet. On a success, the target takes 0d6 slashing damage and is wrapped in molten wire for 1 minute. It is [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] and takes 0d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns, with a basic Reflex save. The wire's [[Actions/Escape|Escape]] DC is your class DC. The wire has AC 10 and 75 HP. The impulse ends if the creature Escapes or the wire is destroyed.

* * *

**Level (+4)** The slashing damage increases by 1d6, the fire damage increases by 1d4, and the wire's HP increases by 25.
