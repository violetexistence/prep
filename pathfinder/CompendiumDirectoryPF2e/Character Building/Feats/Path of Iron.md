# Path of Iron `pf2:3`
## Feat 14
### [[archetype]][[flourish]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Martial Artist Dedication
* * *
**Frequency** once per minute

* * *

With a burst of effort and speed, you weave a nimble path through your many enemies, striking each in turn as you move past them. You Stride; this movement doesn't trigger reactions. You can attempt a melee Strike up to three times at any point during your movement, each against a different enemy. Each attack counts toward your multiple attack penalty, but your multiple attack penalty doesn't increase until you have made all your attacks.
