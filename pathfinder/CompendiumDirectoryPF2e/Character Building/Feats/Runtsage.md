# Runtsage
## Feat 5
### [[hobgoblin]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Unlike most of your kind, who dismiss goblins as embarrassments or expendable annoyances, you have studied the methodology behind their irresponsible and incomprehensible actions. You gain the [[Feats/Adopted Ancestry|Adopted Ancestry]] general feat and must select goblin as the feat's chosen ancestry. You also gain one 1st-level goblin ancestry feat.
