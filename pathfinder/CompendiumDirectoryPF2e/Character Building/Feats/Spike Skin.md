# Spike Skin `pf2:2`
## Feat 8
### [[earth]][[impulse]][[kineticist]][[primal]]

**Category** class; 




You touch a willing creature, causing its skin to harden and form spiky protrusions. The target gains resistance 4 to all physical damage (except adamantine). Whenever a creature damages the target with an unarmed attack or non-reach melee weapon, the attacking creature takes -6 piercing damage.

This impulse lasts for 10 minutes, but each time the target takes physical damage, the duration decreases by 1 minute. The target is temporarily immune to this impulse for 1 hour. If you use Spike Skin again, any previous one ends.

* * *

**Level (+2)** The resistance and damage each increase by 2.
