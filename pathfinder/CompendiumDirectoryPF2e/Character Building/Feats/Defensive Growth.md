# Defensive Growth `pf2:r`
## Feat 6
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[deviant]][[magical]][[plant]][[wood]]

**Category** class; 




**Trigger** You're the target of a physical attack.

* * *

You grow a shield of woven flowers and branches, then Raise that Shield to defend yourself from the triggering attack. If you would take damage from the attack, you immediately [[Feats/Shield Block|Shield Block]]. This is a [[Equipment/Wooden Shield|Wooden Shield]] (Hardness 3, HP 12, BT 6). The shield remains in your possession for a number of rounds equal to your level, or until it's destroyed.

**Awakening** The shield becomes stronger. It has Hardness 5, HP 40, BT 20.

**Awakening** The shield takes on a mind of its own and lashes out vengefully when destroyed. When the shield is destroyed, is explodes, dealing 4d6 piercing damage to your attacker, with a `Reflex check` save.
