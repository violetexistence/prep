# Heart of the Kaiju
## Feat 20
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[druid]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Monstrosity Shape
* * *
Witnessing the might of the kaiju King Mogaru, Alru, and Toraloa up close awoke a new ferocity within you. When you transform using [[Feats/Monstrosity Shape|Monstrosity Shape]], you can take on a kaiju form. When you take this feat, choose acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage; this is the damage your breath weapon deals. You can't change this later. The battle form is Gargantuan size with the following specific abilities; the damage values already include the extra die from being a 9th-rank spell.

**Kaiju** Speed 40 feet; physical resistance 5;

**Melee** `pf2:1` jaws (reach 20 feet), **Damage** 3d12+20 piercing;

**Melee** `pf2:1` claws (agile, reach 20 feet), **Damage** 3d8+20 slashing;

**Breath Weapon** `pf2:2` (evocation, primal) Each creature in a 60-foot cone takes 15d6 damage (of your chosen damage type), with a `Reflex check` save against your spell DC. Once activated, your breath weapon can't be used again for 1d4 rounds.
