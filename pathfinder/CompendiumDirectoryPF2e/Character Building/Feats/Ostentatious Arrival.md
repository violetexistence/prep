# Ostentatious Arrival `pf2:0`
## Feat 6
### [[concentrate]][[manipulate]][[spellshape]][[summoner]]

**Category** class; 




If the next action you take is to Manifest your Eidolon as a three-action activity, or to Cast a three-action summoning Spell, the creature appears in an explosion.

All creatures except you in a 10-foot emanation around the creature you summoned or manifested take 1d4 fire damage per spell rank for a summoning spell, or 1d4 damage per 2 levels for Manifesting your Eidolon.

If the creature you summoned or manifested has the acid, cold, electricity, fire, sonic, or water trait, the damage is that type instead (or cold damage for the water trait). If the creature has more than one of these traits, you choose which damage type to deal.
