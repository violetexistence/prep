# Empiricist's Eye
## Feat 12
### [[investigator]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** empiricism methodology
* * *
Sharp and piercing, your eyes see all and convey more. Your [[Actions/Point Out|Point Out]] actions lose the auditory trait, and you don't need to be heard to convey the information to your allies. In addition, a creature you Point Out is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] to your allies until the start of your next turn.

* * *

**Special** If you have the [[Feats/Blind-Fight|Blind-Fight]] feat, your allies gain that feat's benefits against any creature that's off-guard due to Empiricist's Eye.
