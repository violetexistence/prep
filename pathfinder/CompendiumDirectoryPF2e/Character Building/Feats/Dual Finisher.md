## Feat 8
### [[finisher]][[swashbuckler]]

**Category** class; 




**Requirements** You wield two melee weapons, one in each hand.

* * *

You split your attacks. Make two melee [[Actions/Strike|Strikes]], one with each required weapon, each against a different foe. If the second Strike is made with a non-agile weapon, it takes a -2 penalty.

Increase your multiple attack penalty only after attempting both Strikes.
