# Healing Bomb
## Feat 4
### [[additive]][[alchemist]]

**Category** class; 




You can add a foamy catalyst to an elixir of life to turn it into a topical projectile. You can throw the elixir as though it were an alchemical bomb, with the following results.

* * *

**Success** The target is affected as though it drank the elixir, and each living creature adjacent to it regains HP from the bomb equal to the elixir's number of damage dice (3 HP for a lesser elixir of life, for example).

**Failure** The target regains HP equal to the elixir's number of damage dice.

**Critical Failure** The healing bomb has no effect.
