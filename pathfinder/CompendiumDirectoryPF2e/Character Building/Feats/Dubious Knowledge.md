# Dubious Knowledge
## Feat 1
### [[general]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** trained in a skill with the Recall Knowledge action
* * *
You're a treasure trove of information, but not all of it comes from reputable sources. When you fail (but don't critically fail) a Recall Knowledge check using any skill, you learn the correct answer and an erroneous answer, but you don't have any way to differentiate which is which. This can occur as knowing something is significant, but not whether it's good or bad.
