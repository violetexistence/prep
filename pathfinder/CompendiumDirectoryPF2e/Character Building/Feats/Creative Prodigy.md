You have a powerful creative drive that is clear to any who interact with you. You are trained in Performance. If you were already trained in Performance (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also gain the [[Feats/Impressive Performance|Impressive Performance]] skill feat, and when you use Performance [[Actions/make-an-impression variant=performance|make-an-impression variant=performance]], you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the check.
