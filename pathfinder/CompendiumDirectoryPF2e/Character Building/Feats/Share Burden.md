# Share Burden `pf2:r`
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Curse Maelstrom Dedication
* * *
**Trigger** An ally within 60 feet would be affected by a curse or misfortune effect, and you wouldn't be affected but you are an eligible target for the effect.

* * *

You draw the misfortune or curse into yourself, potentially enabling you to enter your curse maelstrom state. Instead of affecting your ally, the triggering curse or misfortune effect affects you.
