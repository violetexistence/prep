### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Acrobat Dedication
* * *
You're so fond of using your Acrobatic feats on the stage that you've begun adding your own flair to these dances on the big stage. When you [[Actions/Perform|Perform]], if you do a performance that is either related to dance, acting or opera, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the roll. If you're legendary in Acrobatics, this increases to a +2 circumstance bonus. You gain the [[Actions/Dancing Dodge|Dancing Dodge]] reaction.
