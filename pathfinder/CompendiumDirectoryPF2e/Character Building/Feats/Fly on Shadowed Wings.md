## Feat 10
### [[animist]][[apparition]]

**Category** class; 




**Frequency** once per hour

Your apparition embraces you, feeding on your magic to become a pair of protective wings. Choose one of your attuned apparitions; for 10 minutes, you gain a fly Speed equal to your land Speed and resistance to precision damage equal to your level, but your chosen apparition is dispersed for the duration, automatically re-attuning to you after 10 minutes.
