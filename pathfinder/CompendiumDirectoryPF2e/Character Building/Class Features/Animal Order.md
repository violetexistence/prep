# Animal Order
## Feat 1
### [[druid]]

**Category** classfeature; 




You have a strong connection to beasts, always feeling like you understood them (and they you) better than your own people. You stand for the animals of nature, a powerful animal companion at your side.

**Order Skill** Athletics

**Druid Feat** [[Feats/Animal Companion|Animal Companion]]

**Order Spell** [[Spells/Heal Animal|Heal Animal]]

**Anathema** Commit wanton cruelty to animals or kill animals unnecessarily. (This doesn't prevent you from defending yourself against animals or killing them cleanly for food).
