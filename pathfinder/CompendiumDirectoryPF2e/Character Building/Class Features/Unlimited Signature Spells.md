# Unlimited Signature Spells
## Feat 3
### [[summoner]]

**Category** classfeature; 




All of your spells are signature spells. That means that if you know a spell, you can heighten it freely by casting it from a higher-rank spell slot, up to the maximum rank of spell you can cast. You can similarly cast any of its lower-rank versions without learning them separately.
