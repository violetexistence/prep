# Echo of Lost Moments
## Feat 1
### [[animist]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Echoes of lost moments are apparitions born from memories that everyone has forgotten, often arising from fragmented pieces of magic and memory left behind by time-altering magic. They may even occur in response to significant temporal tampering, cleaning up fragments of time damaged by irresponsible magic. These apparitions are drawn to animists who are orderly and responsible, and they can give such hosts access to spells that alter a target's timeline or removes them from the current timeline, reveal visions of past or future events, or even accelerate magical effects to a point in time where they have already ended.
