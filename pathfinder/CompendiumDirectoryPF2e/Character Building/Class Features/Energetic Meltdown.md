# Energetic Meltdown
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** classfeature; 




As you channel energy through your deviant abilities, some of it turns back on you, spiking your body temperature or dancing across your skin.

[[Feat_Feature Effects/Effect_ Energetic Meltdown|Effect: Energetic Meltdown]]

**Mild Backlash** You take damage equal to your level as energy scours your body.

**Moderate Backlash** Energy wracks your body. After taking the damage, you gain weakness to the energy type of your backlash until your next daily preparations. The weakness is equal to one-third of your level. You also lose immunity to the energy type if you had it, until your next daily preparations.

**Severe Backlash** Whatever furnace or well within you that provides the energy for your deviation overloads completely, cascading out of you in an uncontrolled burst. You deal 1d6 damage per level to all creatures in a 30-foot emanation with a `Fortitude check` save. You automatically take full damage without attempting a save.
