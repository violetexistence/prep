# Blunt Shot
## Feat 1
### [[inventor]]

**Category** classfeature; 




**Ranged Only**

* * *

Your weapon innovation can file the edges off your ammunition and adjust the blunt force of the shot to deliver an attack that can batter as much as pierce, or even knock an opponent right off their feet. Your innovation gains the concussive and ranged trip traits.
