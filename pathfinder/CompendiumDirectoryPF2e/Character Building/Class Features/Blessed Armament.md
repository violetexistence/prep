# Blessed Armament
## Feat 1
### [[champion]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Select one weapon or handwraps of mighty blows. You gain that armament's critical specialization effect, and you grant the armament a property rune of your choice from the following list: [[Equipment/Fearsome|Fearsome]], [[Equipment/Ghost Touch|Ghost Touch]], [[Equipment/Returning|Returning]], [[Equipment/Shifting|Shifting]], or [[Equipment/Vitalizing|Vitalizing]]. During your daily preparations, you can change the spirit to inhabit a different armament, grant a different rune, or both.

This rune doesn't count toward the weapon's number of property runes. It can be used even if the weapon already has its maximum number of property runes.
