# Perpetual Infusions (Mutagenist)
## Feat 7
### [[alchemist]]

**Category** classfeature; 




You have learned how to create perpetual alchemical infusions that can provide a near-infinite supply of certain simple items.

You gain the ability to create two 1st-level alchemical items using [[Class Features/Quick Alchemy|Quick Alchemy]] without spending a batch of infused reagents. The items you can select depend on your research field and must be in your formula book.

Each time you gain a level, you can swap any number of your perpetual infusions with other eligible infusions.

Choose two 1st-level mutagens.
