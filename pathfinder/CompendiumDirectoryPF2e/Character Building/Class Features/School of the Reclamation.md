# School of the Reclamation
## Feat 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[wizard]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Whether it's been lost to war, abandoned during calamity, or simply buried by the ages, there is as much important knowledge to be found in the hidden corners of the world as in the schools and libraries of the academy. Your study of magic in the service of rediscovering lost knowledge for the Sarkoris Reclamation has taught you that much that was once lost can still be found, but only if someone is willing to seek it out and retrieve it. You've focused your magic on reaching the world's hidden and forgotten places, whether they are found in a distant ruin or the depths of a lost memory, and bringing their knowledge back to the surfaceâ€”whatever the cost.
