# Muses
## Feat 1
### [[bard]]

**Category** classfeature; 




As a bard, you select one muse at 1st level. This muse leads you to great things and might be someone you know, a supernatural creature, location, deity, philosophy, or captivating mystery. Depending on the type of inspiration you receive, your 1st-level muse grants you a specific 1st-level bard feat and adds a spell to your repertoire.

In addition to this, each muse opens the door to many later bard feats. If one type of inspiration is not enough to represent your muse, consider the [[Feats/Multifarious Muse|Multifarious Muse]] feat.
