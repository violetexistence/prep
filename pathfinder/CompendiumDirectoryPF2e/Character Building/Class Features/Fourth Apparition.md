# Fourth Apparition
## Feat 15
### [[animist]]

**Category** classfeature; 




You're truly loved by the spirits, with apparitions flocking to you from far and wide. When you attune to apparitions during your daily preparations, you choose four apparitions to attune to, with one of them being your primary apparition. The number of Focus Points in your focus pool increases by 1 (maximum 3).
