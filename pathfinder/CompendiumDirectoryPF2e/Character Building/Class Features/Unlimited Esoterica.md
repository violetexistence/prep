# Unlimited Esoterica
## Feat 19
### [[thaumaturge]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Your understanding of your esoterica becomes so complete that you can access your mystic tools without even thinking. You can use Exploit Vulnerability or Intensify Vulnerability as a free action, rather than a single action, though still with a frequency of only once per round.
