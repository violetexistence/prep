# Initiate Benefit (Shield)
## Feat 1
### [[thaumaturge]]

**Category** classfeature; 




You gain the [[Feats/Shield Block|Shield Block]] general feat. If your shield implement would be reduced to 0 Hit Points, it's instead reduced to 1 Hit Point, its circumstance bonus to AC when you Raise a Shield is reduced by 1 (this can't reduce the bonus below 0), and you can't Shield Block with your shield implement until it loses the [[Conditions/Broken|Broken]] condition. You can still use your shield as an implement when it has the broken condition.

At 5th level, whenever you [[Actions/Exploit Vulnerability|Exploit Vulnerability]], you can also Raise a Shield as a free action.
