# Eternal Confidence
## Feat 19
### [[swashbuckler]]

**Category** classfeature; 




As a swashbuckler at the peak of your skill, you swell with confidence and bravado in every attack. Your proficiency rank for your swashbuckler class DC increases to master.

When you Strike as part of a finisher or [[Actions/Opportune Riposte|Opportune Riposte]], you can give the Strike the failure effect from the [[Actions/Confident Finisher|Confident Finisher]] action, including the increase from [[Feats/Precise Finisher|Precise Finisher]] if you have that feat.

You can do so only if the Strike uses a weapon or unarmed attack that you could use for Confident Finisher.
