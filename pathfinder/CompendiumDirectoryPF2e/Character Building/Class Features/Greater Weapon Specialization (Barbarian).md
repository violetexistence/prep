# Greater Weapon Specialization (Barbarian)
## Feat 15
### [[barbarian]]

**Category** classfeature; 




The weapons you've mastered become truly fearsome in your hands. Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.

You gain a greater benefit from your instinct's specialization ability. See specific instincts for more information.
