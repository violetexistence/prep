# Revolutionary Innovation
## Feat 15
### [[inventor]]

**Category** classfeature; 




You are an unparalleled genius and have discovered a technique that will revolutionize your chosen field—or at least for the time being, your innovation! Choose a revolutionary modification to apply to your innovation. You can also choose an initial or breakthrough modification of the same type instead, if you prefer.

### Revolutionary Armor Modifications

*   **[[Class Features/Automated Impediments|Automated Impediments]]:** Your armor uses electromagnetic fields, subharmonic distortions, or other techniques to make it difficult for those close to you to move unless you allow it. While wearing your armor, all spaces adjacent to you are difficult terrain for your enemies.
*   **[[Class Features/Energy Barrier|Energy Barrier]]:** Your armor's defenses ablate any kind of energy coming your way. While wearing your armor, you gain resistance to all energy damage (acid, cold, electricity, fire, force, sonic, vitality, and void damage) equal to 2 + half your level. You must have the harmonic oscillator, metallic reactance, or phlogistonic regulator modification to select this modification.
*   **[[Class Features/Incredible Resistance|Incredible Resistance]]:** You've improved upon your breakthrough modification's ability to resist damage. Choose one of the following breakthrough modifications your innovation has: dense plating, layered mesh, or tensile absorption. Increase the resistance you gain from that modification to be equal to your level, instead of half your level.
*   **[[Class Features/Multisensory Mask|Multisensory Mask]] (subterfuge suit only):** You've built a multisensory mask over your armor that protects you by distorting your figure from all senses, leaving behind only a hazy image, muffled sounds, and so forth. While wearing the armor, you gain concealment against all creatures, even if they are using a nonvisual precise sense, such as a bat's echolocation. As normal for effects that leave your location obvious, you can't use this concealment to Hide or Sneak. If you use a hostile action, the concealment ends until you restore the mask as a single action, which has the manipulate trait.
*   **[[Class Features/Perfect Fortification|Perfect Fortification]] (power suit only):** You've outfitted your armor with such heavy fortifications that deadly attacks often lose their edge. Each time you're critically hit while wearing the armor, attempt a DC 13 flat check. On a success, it becomes a normal hit. This isn't cumulative with _fortification_ runes or other abilities that reduce critical hits with a flat check. Additionally, you gain resistance 2 + half your level against precision damage.
*   **[[Class Features/Physical Protections|Physical Protections]]:** Your armor has so many adjustments and precautions that it can guard against all physical damage. While wearing your armor, you gain resistance to all physical damage (bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, as well as persistent bleed damage) equal to half your level. You must have the dense plating, layered mesh, or tensile absorption breakthrough modification to select this modification.
*   **[[Class Features/Rune Capacity|Rune Capacity]]:** Whether you've done some dabbling in orichalcum alloys or found another engineering solution, you've built your innovation in such a way that it can hold an additional property rune. Your innovation can have one more property rune than a normal item of its kind (to a maximum of four property runes with a +3 _potency_ armor).
    

### Revolutionary Construct Modifications

*   **Flight Chassis:** You fit your construct with a means of flight, such as adding rotors or rebuilding it with wings and a lightweight construction. Your innovation gains a fly Speed of 25 feet.
*   **Miracle Gears:** As you perfect your innovation's cortex, it becomes much more intelligent. Its Intelligence modifier increases by 2, and it learns a language of your choice from among the languages you know. Your construct gains the ability to use actions that require greater Intelligence, like [[Actions/Coerce|Coerce]] and Decipher Writing. Finally, your construct becomes legendary in two Intelligence- or Charisma-based skills of your choice. You must have the marvelous gears modification to select this modification.
*   **Resistant Coating:** Your innovation is hard to damage by any means. It gains resistance 5 to all damage (except adamantine).
*   **Runic Keystone:** You've incorporated a device similar to a _runestone_ into your innovation, allowing it to hold a property rune, even though it isn't a weapon or suit of armor. An armor property rune affects your innovation itself if it would affect the wearer of the armor. A weapon property rune grants whatever properties it would normally grant to a weapon to your innovation's unarmed attacks, following all the requirements as normal (for instance, a _vorpal_ rune would only apply to slashing melee unarmed attacks); if the rune affects only ranged attacks, it has no effect unless your innovation has a built-in ranged attack (from the projectile launcher initial modification, for example). If the rune would affect the physical shape or appearance of the weapon or armor itself, like _raiment_, the rune has no effect when etched into your construct.
*   **Wall Configuration:** Your innovation can transform from a mobile construct to a stationary battlefield emplacement. It can unfold as a 2-action activity that has the manipulate trait, changing from its usual form into a thin, straight wall of metal and gears up to 10 feet tall and 30 feet long. The wall must extend through your innovation's original space. While your construct is a wall, it can't take any actions except to use the same activity to transform back, and it can't defend itself easily, making it [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] and giving it an additional –2 status penalty to its AC. The wall blocks line of sight and effect unless your innovation has half its maximum HP or fewer, at which point holes in the wall allow creatures to see through and attack with cover, and Tiny creatures to slip through.
    

### Revolutionary Weapon Modifications

*   **[[Class Features/Attack Refiner|Attack Refiner]]:** Your weapon makes minute recalibrations after every missed attack to ensure the next lands with vicious efficacy. Your innovation gains the backswing and forceful traits.
*   **[[Class Features/Deadly Strike|Deadly Strike]]:** Through precise calculation, you've found the perfect way for your weapon to deal damage on a well-placed strike. Your innovation gains the deadly d8 trait. If your innovation was already deadly, increase the die by up to two die sizes (d6 to d10, d8 to d12), to a maximum of deadly d12.
*   **[[Class Features/Enhanced Damage|Enhanced Damage]]:** You've made your innovation more powerful than other weapons of its kind. Increase your innovation's weapon damage die by one step (d4 to d6, d6 to d8, d8 to d10, d10 to d12). As normal, you can't increase your die by more than one size, so this modification isn't cumulative with complex simplicity.
*   **[[Class Features/Extensible Weapon|Extensible Weapon]] (melee only):** You've found a way to construct your weapon so that it can extend while leaving its balance unchanged. Your innovation gains the reach trait. If the weapon already had the reach trait, it increases your reach by an additional 10 feet, instead of the usual additional 5 feet.
*   **[[Class Features/Impossible Alloy|Impossible Alloy]]:** Other inventors claim it's not even technically possible, but you've managed to create several metal alloys that seem to work for only you. These alloys can damage opponents vulnerable to any one of the seven skymetals. Your innovation is treated as all seven skymetals (abysium, adamantine, djezet, inubrix, noqual, orichalcum, and siccatite). This means you deal more damage to a variety of creatures, though you don't apply any of the other special effects for weapons made of those skymetals.
*   **[[Class Features/Momentum Enhancer|Momentum Enhancer]]:** A special device lets your weapon move with uncanny speed. Your innovation gains the agile trait; if it had the reload ability, you can reload once per round as a free action.
*   **[[Class Features/Omnirange Stabilizers|Omnirange Stabilizers]] (ranged only):** You've modified your innovation to be dangerous and effective at any range. If your innovation had the volley trait, remove the volley trait. Otherwise, increase your innovation's range increment by 50 feet or an amount equal to the weapon's base range increment, whichever is more.
*   **[[Class Features/Rune Capacity|Rune Capacity]]:** Whether you've dabbled with orichalcum or found another engineering solution, you've built your innovation in such a way that it can hold an additional property rune. Your innovation can have one more property rune than a normal item of its kind (to a maximum of four property runes with a +3 _potency_ weapon).
