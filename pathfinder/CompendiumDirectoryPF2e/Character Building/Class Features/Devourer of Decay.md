# Devourer of Decay
## Feat 1
### [[witch]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Your patron appeared at the end or near the end of a life, flickering in feverish visions or glinting mysteriously in the eyes of waiting scavengers. Although horrifying to many, decay creates the resources needed for new life. This fate awaits you and possibly even your patron, whether they're a towering arboreal, a subterranean fungus creature, or one of the psychopomps that shepherds the entire process along.

**Spell List** primal

**Patron Skill** Nature

**Lesson of the Hungry Scavenger** Your patron teaches ways to convert death into new life. You gain the [[Spells/Scrounger's Glee|Scrounger's Glee]] hex cantrip, and your familiar learns [[Spells/Enfeeble|Enfeeble]].

**Familiar of Parasitic Might** Your familiar appears gaunt and malnourished or otherwise on the brink of death, even though it's quite healthy. When you Cast or Sustain a hex, your familiar can draw on the waning strength of another to sustain itself. One creature within 15 feet of your familiar with less than half of its maximum Hit Points becomes [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] unless it succeeds at a Fortitude saving throw against your spell DC.
