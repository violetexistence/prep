# Liturgist
## Feat 1
### [[animist]]

**Category** classfeature; 




You draw forth your apparitions through the power of song and dance, connecting the spiritual to the physical. These performances can be of your own creation or follow the specific rites of your religion.

**Song of Invocation (1st):** You can sing out to the spirits to have them spin and twirl around you. You gain the [[Feats/Circle of Spirits|Circle of Spirits]] feat.

**Dancing Invocation (9th):** The movement of your body grants power to your magic. When you [[Actions/Leap|Leap]], Step, or [[Actions/Tumble Through|Tumble Through]], you also Sustain an apparition spell or vessel spell.

**Invocation of Praise (17th):** Your liturgies call to the spirits even in the heat of battle. When you roll initiative, you can use Circle of Spirits as a free action. If your first action on your first turn is to cast an apparition cantrip granted by your primary apparition, you reduce the number of actions it takes to cast it by 1 (minimum 1 action).
