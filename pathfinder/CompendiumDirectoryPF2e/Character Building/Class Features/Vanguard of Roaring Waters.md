# Vanguard of Roaring Waters
## Feat 1
### [[animist]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Vanguards of roaring waters are found where rivers carve their way through mountains, creating fearsome rapids. They can also be found near bays where rivers meet the sea and create turbulent breakers and unpredictable undertows, coastal reefs that tear the bottoms from unwary ships and isolate islands, or anywhere else where water becomes violent and difficult to navigate safely. Vanguards of roaring waters encourage chaos and are easily bored.
