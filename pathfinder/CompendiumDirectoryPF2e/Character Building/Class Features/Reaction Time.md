# Reaction Time
## Feat 7
### [[guardian]]

**Category** classfeature; 




You're always on the lookout for danger and can react to it in an instant. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert. At the start of each of your turns, you gain an additional reaction that you can use only for reactions from guardian feats or class features (including [[Feats/Shield Block|Shield Block]]). If you have the Ever Ready class feature, you also gain this additional reaction when you roll initiative for combat.
