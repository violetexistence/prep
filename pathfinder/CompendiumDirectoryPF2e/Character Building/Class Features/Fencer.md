# Fencer
## Feat 1
### [[swashbuckler]]

**Category** classfeature; 




You move carefully, feinting and creating false openings to lead your foes into inopportune attacks. You are trained in Deception. When you [[Actions/Create a Diversion|Create a Diversion]] or [[Actions/Feint|Feint]], the action gains the bravado trait.
