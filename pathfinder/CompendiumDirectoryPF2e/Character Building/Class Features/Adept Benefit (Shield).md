# Adept Benefit (Shield)
## Feat 7
### [[thaumaturge]]

**Category** classfeature; 




When you have your shield implement raised, you gain a status bonus to your saves against spells and other magic effects equal to your circumstance bonus to AC from your shield. In addition, damage you take as a result of a spell or magical effect while your [[Actions/Raise a Shield|Shield is Raised]] can trigger your [[Feats/Shield Block|Shield Block]] reaction, even if the damage isn't physical.
