# Greater Field Discovery (Toxicologist)
## Feat 13
### [[alchemist]]

**Category** classfeature; 




When a creature fails its initial saving throw against an infused injury poison you created, the wound sprays poison onto another creature adjacent to it.

The attacker who caused the injury chooses which creature, if there's more than one, and can choose to forgo this effect.

That creature is exposed to the poison. The second creature doesn't spread the poison further.
