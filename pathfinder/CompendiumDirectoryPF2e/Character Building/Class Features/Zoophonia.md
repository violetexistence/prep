## Feat 1
### [[bard]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Your muse is a master of birdsong, wolf howls, trumpeting elephants, and other animal communication, pushing you to new heights and encouraging your connections with nature. If your muse is a creature, it might be an enlightened animal or a spirit guide. If it's a deity, it might be one of the Wardens of the Wild, Gozreh, or another representative of nature.
