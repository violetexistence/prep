# Monarch of the Fey Courts
## Feat 1
### [[animist]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Monarchs of the fey courts make their homes near places with strong ties to the First World, or in places where nymphs once held sway. They are drawn to animists who blend an appreciation for art and nature's beauty with a ruler's ambition. Monarchs of fey courts are vain, capricious, and do not easily forgive slights or poor manners.
