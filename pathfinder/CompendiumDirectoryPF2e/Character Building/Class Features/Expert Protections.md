# Expert Protections
## Feat 11
### [[animist]]

**Category** classfeature; 




The spiritual entities that protect you warn you of harm before it would occur, giving you more time to react, and help bear the burden of your armor when it is necessary. Your proficiency rank for light armor, medium armor, unarmored defense, and Reflex saves increases to expert.
