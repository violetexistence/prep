# Echoes of the Spells
## Feat 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[calling]][[mythic]]

**Category** calling; 




The potency of Spellmasters past flows through you. When you [[Actions/Identify Magic|Identify Magic]], [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]], or [[Feats/Trick Magic Item|Trick Magic Item]], you can spend a Mythic Point to make the check at mythic proficiency. The first time each day that you critically succeed on a check with a skill corresponding to any magical traditions you possess while Identifying Magic, Recalling Knowledge, or Tricking a Magic Item, you regain a Mythic Point.
