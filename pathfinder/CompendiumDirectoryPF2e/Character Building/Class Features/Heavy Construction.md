# Heavy Construction
## Feat 7
### [[inventor]]

**Category** classfeature; 




**Power Suit only**

* * *

You've expanded your innovation into a heavy bulwark, and your groundbreaking design ensures you don't take any of the drawbacks for such heavy defenses. Your innovation becomes heavy armor, and your proficiency in your innovation armor (but no other heavy armor) advances to be equal to your proficiency in medium armor. If your Strength modifier is at least +3, you remove the Speed penalty entirely instead of reducing it to –5 feet.

The armor's adjusted statistics are: _AC Bonus_ +5; _Dex Cap_ +1; _Check Penalty_ –2; _Speed Penalty_ –10 feet; _Strength_ +3; _Bulk_ 3; _Group_ composite; _Armor Traits_ bulwark, entrench.
