**Champion's Reaction** [[Actions/Liberating Step|Liberating Step]]

**Relentless Reaction (9th Level)** You punish those who ensnare your allies. If the triggering enemy was using any effects to make your ally [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]], [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]], [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]], or [[Conditions/Paralyzed|Paralyzed]] when you used Liberating Step, that enemy takes persistent spirit damage equal to your Charisma modifier.

**Exalted Reaction (11th Level)** In addition to the ally affected by Liberating Step, you and all other allies in your champion's aura can Step as a free action. You and your allies gain the benefit even if the ally who benefited from Liberating Step can't move.
