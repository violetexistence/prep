# Thief of Moonlight
## Feat 15
### [[exemplar]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Though your tales are not sung out loud, they still live on as cautionary tales, whispers, tall tales, and half-believed rumors. You walk hidden behind stars, capable of taking anything; the lights of the heavens are not safe from your avarice. After you Spark Transcendence, as a free action you can attempt a check to [[Actions/Palm an Object|Palm an Object]] or to [[Actions/Steal|Steal]] an item from an enemy within 30 feet. The relocated objects simply disappear and reappear in your hand.
