## Feat 1
### [[ikon]]

**Category** classfeature; 




**Usage** imbued in the eyes

* * *

Your eyes glint with an almost-tangible sharpness, letting you spot the tiniest swallow on the horizon or the swiftest arrow in flight.

**Immanence** Your vision sharpens and allows you to sense an enemy's attack almost as soon as it begins, granting you a +1 status bonus to Perception checks and a +2 status bonus to your AC against ranged attacks.

**Transcendenceâ€”**[[Actions/A Moment Unending|A Moment Unending]] `pf2:1` (concentrate, prediction, transcendence)
