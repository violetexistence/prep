# Dynamic Weighting
## Feat 1
### [[inventor]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Your weapon is modified to be heavier and easier to manipulate or retrieve. Your innovation gains the two-hand trait, with a damage die one size higher than the weapon's normal weapon damage die size (for instance, a longsword would gain the two-hand d10 trait). Your innovation also gains the versatile B trait. If it was a thrown weapon, it gains the tethered trait.
