# Savvy Reflexes
## Feat 15
### [[investigator]]

**Category** classfeature; 




With an eye for incoming danger, you masterfully keep yourself out of harm's way. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Reflex save, you get a critical success instead.
