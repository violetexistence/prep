| **Critical Blast** If the target of the critical hit is adjacent to a surface, roots entangle it. The target is [[Conditions/Immobilized\|Immobilized]] and must spend an Interact action to attempt a `DC 10 Athletics check` check to pull itself free. The target doesn't become stuck if it is incorporeal, is liquid, or could otherwise escape without effort |
| **Elemental Resistance** poison, wood |
| **Impulse Junction** You gain temporary Hit Points equal to your level that last until the start of your next turn. |
| **Aura Junction** Life-giving blossoms spring up around you. Any ally that begins its turn in the aura gains 1 temporary Hit Point that lasts until the start of its next turn. This increases to 2 temporary Hit Points if you're 10th level or higher and to 3 temporary Hit Points if you're 15th level or higher. |
| **Skill Junction** Survival, [[Feats/Terrain Expertise\|Terrain Expertise (forest)]] |
