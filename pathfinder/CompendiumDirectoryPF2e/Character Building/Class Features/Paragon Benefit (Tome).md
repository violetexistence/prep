# Paragon Benefit (Tome)
## Feat 17
### [[thaumaturge]]

**Category** classfeature; 




In addition to the other benefits, your tome's information alerts you to ambushes and attacks from your foes. While holding your tome, you can always roll a skill check for initiative against creatures or haunts using Esoteric Lore. If you do, you gain a +3 circumstance bonus to your initiative roll.

The initiate benefit's circumstance bonus to Recall Knowledge from holding your tome increases from +1 to +2. When you succeed at the Recall Knowledge check granted by the tome's adept benefit, the bonus applies to all attack rolls you make before the start of your next turn, not just your next one. Lastly, when you gain temporary skill proficiencies, both are legendary.
