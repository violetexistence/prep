# Wave Order
## Feat 1
### [[druid]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Water is the source of life, and you've learned to shape how it flows.

**Order Skill** Medicine

**Druid Feat** [[Feats/Shore Step|Shore Step]]

**Order Spell** [[Spells/Rising Surf|Rising Surf]]

**Anathema** Polluting water or allowing those who pollute water sources to go unpunished. (this doesn't force you to take action against potential water pollution or to sacrifice yourself against an obviously superior foe).
