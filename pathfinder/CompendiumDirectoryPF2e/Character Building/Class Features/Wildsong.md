# Wildsong
## Feat 1
### [[druid]]

**Category** classfeature; 




You know the Wildsong, a secret language known only within druid orders, in addition to any languages you know through your ancestry. The Wildsong is a melodic and tonal language sounding more like animal calls than a spoken tongue, and its alphabet involves fractals and spirals, like the arrangement of a seashell's chambers, a snowflake's crystals, or a fern's fronds. Teaching the Wildsong to non-druids is anathema.
