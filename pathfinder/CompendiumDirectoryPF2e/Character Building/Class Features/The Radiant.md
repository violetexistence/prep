# The Radiant
## Feat 3
### [[exemplar]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Leaders must live bigger lives than any other, shining so brightly that they attract followers, inspire troops, and change the course of kingdoms. You are trained in Diplomacy. After you Spark Transcendence, you inspire an ally within 30 feet to push on, restoring Hit Points equal to 2 + double your level; this is a mental and emotion effect. The ally is then temporarily immune for 10 minutes.
