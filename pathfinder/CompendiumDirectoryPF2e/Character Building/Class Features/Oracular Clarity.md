# Oracular Clarity
## Feat 19
### [[oracle]]

**Category** classfeature; 




You now fully grasp the nature of the divine power behind your mystery, allowing you to work magic akin to miracles. Add two common 10th-rank divine spells to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-rank spell slot you can use to cast one of those two spells using oracle spellcasting.

You don't gain more 10th-rank spells as you level up, unlike other spell slots, and you can't use 10th-rank slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots. You can take the [[Feats/Oracular Providence|Oracular Providence]] feat to gain a second slot.
