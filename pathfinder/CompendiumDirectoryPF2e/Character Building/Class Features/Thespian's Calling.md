# Thespian's Calling
## Feat 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[calling]][[mythic]]

**Category** calling; 




All the world is a stage, and you're no mere player, but a playwright whose story may change the course of history. When you use Performance to [[Actions/Perform|Perform]] or [[Actions/Earn Income|Earn Income]], you can spend a Mythic Point to attempt the check at mythic proficiency. The first time each day that you critically succeed on a check to Perform, you regain a Mythic Point.

* * *

**Edicts** master new performances, seek opportunities to perform in front of new audiences, support other performers

**Anathema** deny a call for an encore performance, refuse a request to perform in front of an audience, sabotage another performer
