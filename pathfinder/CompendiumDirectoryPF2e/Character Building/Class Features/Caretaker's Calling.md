# Caretaker's Calling
## Feat 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[calling]][[mythic]]

**Category** calling; 




You have a deep-seated drive or divine directive to care for others, and your power might one day grow to allow you to heal an unimaginable wound. When you [[Actions/Treat Disease|Treat Disease]], [[Actions/Treat Poison|Treat Poison]], [[Actions/Treat Wounds|Treat Wounds]], or use [[Feats/Battle Medicine|Battle Medicine]], you can spend a Mythic Point to attempt the check at mythic proficiency. The first time each day that you critically succeed on a check to Treat Wounds, you regain a Mythic Point.

* * *

**Edicts** give aid to others, heal those who are wounded regardless of where they come from

**Anathema** deny care to the disadvantaged, refuse to heal the wounds of an enemy who has surrendered
