# Deny Advantage
## Feat 3
### [[rogue]]

**Category** classfeature; 




As someone who takes advantage of openings, you are careful not to leave such gaps yourself. You aren't [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] to [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]], [[Conditions/Undetected|Undetected]], or flanking creatures of your level or lower, or creatures of your level or lower using surprise attack. However, they can still help their allies flank.
