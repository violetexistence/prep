# School of Gates
## Feat 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[wizard]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Some are content to stay in place and let the world shape them, but you prefer to move at your own pace. You've studied the ancient _aiudara_ and other structures to learn the magic of transposition, using your knowledge to move across great distances and even planes. With knowledge as your path and magic as your key, there's no door you can't open, and no world you won't explore.
