# Initiate Benefit (Weapon)
## Feat 1
### [[thaumaturge]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Your weapon trembles slightly in your hand, seeking out your foe's weakness to it and interrupting their actions. You gain the [[Actions/Implement's Interruption|Implement's Interruption]] reaction.

At 5th level, when you gain thaumaturgic weapon expertise, your instinctive knowledge of your weapon implement also grants you the weapon's critical specialization effect.
