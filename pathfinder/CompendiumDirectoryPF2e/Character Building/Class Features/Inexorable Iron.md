# Inexorable Iron
## Feat 1
### [[magus]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Once you begin along a path, nothing can stop you from reaching its end. You transform the mass of an enormous weapon into an unstoppable force to augment your own striking power or keep you standing on the battlefield.

When you enter Arcane Cascade stance and at the start of each of your turns while you're in that stance, if you're wielding a melee weapon in two hands, you gain temporary Hit Points equal to half your level (minimum 1 temporary HP).
