# Emerald Boughs
## Feat 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[wizard]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Emerald Boughs value the societies and natural communities of the present day, seeking to understand the world as it is and how magic operates therein. Emphasizing camaraderie and sociality, these students tend to be the ones that most eagerly embrace the Magaambya's "practical magic" curriculum where they leave campus and work within communities. While some of these students have been accused of spying for the school, espionage is not an official part of their curriculum. Magic that can serve or sway others—as well as magic that reveals knowledge or allows access to it—is, instead, at the heart of this curriculum.
