# Greater Juggernaut
## Feat 13
### [[barbarian]]

**Category** classfeature; 




You have a stalwart physiology. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to legendary. When you roll a critical failure on a Fortitude save, you get a failure instead. When you roll a failure on a Fortitude save against an effect that deals damage, you halve the damage you take.
