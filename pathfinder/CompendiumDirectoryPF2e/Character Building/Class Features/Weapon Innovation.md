# Weapon Innovation
## Feat 1
### [[inventor]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Your innovation is a complex and impossible-looking weapon augmented by numerous mechanisms. It begins with the same statistics as a level 0 common simple or martial weapon of your choice, or another level 0 simple or martial weapon to which you have access. You can instead use the statistics of a level 0 advanced weapon of your choice; you treat this as a martial weapon for the purposes of proficiency, but you do not gain an initial weapon modification.

An innovation weapon can have fundamental and property runes added to it in the same way as an ordinary weapon. Because of the unique features of your innovation, everyone except you is untrained in it, even if they would normally be trained (or better) in simple or martial weapons.

If you use the Overdrive action, you can choose to change the additional damage from Overdrive to fire damage.

Choose one initial weapon modification to apply to your innovation, either from the following or from other initial weapon modifications to which you have access. These modifications grant additional weapon traits, sometimes with extra abilities.

A modification might give your weapon the versatile trait with a damage type that the weapon could already deal, either from its base damage type or from an existing versatile trait. In that case, if you select that modification, you can instead choose to give the weapon the versatile trait for a different damage type: bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.

*   **[[Class Features/Blunt Shot|Blunt Shot]] (ranged only):** Your weapon innovation can file the edges off your ammunition and adjust the blunt force of the shot to deliver an attack that can batter as much as pierce, or even knock an opponent right off their feet. Your innovation gains the concussive and ranged trip traits.
*   **[[Class Features/Complex Simplicity|Complex Simplicity]] (simple weapon only):** Increase your innovation's weapon damage die by one step (d4 to d6, d6 to d8, d8 to d10, d10 to d12). In addition, it gains two of the following traits of your choice: versatile B, versatile P, versatile S, or razing.
*   **[[Class Features/Dynamic Weighting|Dynamic Weighting]] (one-handed melee weapon only; can't have the agile, attached, or free-hand trait):** Your weapon is modified to be heavier and easier to manipulate or retrieve. Your innovation gains the two-hand trait, with a damage die one size higher than the weapon's normal weapon damage die size (for instance, a longsword would gain the two-hand d10 trait). Your innovation also gains the versatile B trait. If it was a thrown weapon, it gains the tethered trait.
*   **[[Class Features/Entangling Form|Entangling Form]] (melee only):** You've altered your weapon to including tangling wires or straps, or to have a flexible construction. Your innovation gains the disarm, grapple, and trip traits.
*   **[[Class Features/Hampering Spikes|Hampering Spikes]] (melee only):** You've added long, snagging spikes to your weapon, which you can use to impede your foes' movement. Your innovation gains the hampering, trip, and versatile P traits.
*   **[[Class Features/Hefty Composition|Hefty Composition]] (melee only):** Blunt surfaces and sturdy construction make your weapon hefty and mace-like. Your innovation gains the shove, razing, and versatile B traits.
*   **[[Class Features/Modular Head|Modular Head]]:** You've constructed a multi-purpose, adjustable striking surface for your weapon, or you've made special ammunition you can swiftly alter. Your innovation gains the modular trait for bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing. When you Interact to use the modular trait, you can also choose to give the weapon the nonlethal trait if it doesn't currently have it, or to remove that trait if it's currently nonlethal.
*   **[[Class Features/Pacification Tools|Pacification Tools]] (melee only):** Softer materials make your weapon suited to knock out instead of kill, and special protrusions let you catch weapons and disarm your foes. Your innovation gains the disarm, hampering, and nonlethal traits. You can choose whether to apply the nonlethal trait on each attack with your innovation.
*   **[[Class Features/Razor Prongs|Razor Prongs]] (melee only):** You can knock down and slash your foes with sharp, curved blades. Your innovation gains the tearing, trip, and versatile S traits.
*   **[[Class Features/Segmented Frame|Segmented Frame]]:** Hinges, clamps, and telescoping parts make your innovation collapsible and adjustable. It gains the modular trait for bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing. You can Interact to collapse the item down to light Bulk or to return it to your normal form. When it's collapsed to light Bulk, it has the concealable trait, which grants you a +2 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks and DCs to hide or conceal the weapon.
