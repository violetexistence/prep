# Paragon Benefit (Regalia)
## Feat 17
### [[thaumaturge]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Your regalia grants you the true gravitas of rulership, tying together the hearts and minds of your allies and making it impossible for you to leave a bad impression. If you roll a critical failure on a check to [[Actions/Coerce|Coerce]], [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]], or [[Actions/Request|Request]], you get a failure instead. When others use [[Actions/Follow the Expert|Follow the Expert]] to follow you, you grant them a +3 circumstance bonus if you are trained or +4 if you are an expert or above.

Allies in your inspiring aura aren't [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] from being flanked unless you too are flanked. If one of your allies in the aura is [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy]], [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled]], [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened]], [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened]], or [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied]], the status penalty your ally takes from the condition is 1 lower than the condition's value as long as the ally remains in the aura, unless you too are affected by the same condition.
