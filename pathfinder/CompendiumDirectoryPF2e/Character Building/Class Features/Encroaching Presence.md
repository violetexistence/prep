# Encroaching Presence
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** classfeature; 




Seeing and touching the beyond leaves you open to its alien influence, warping your perceptions and thoughts.

[[Feat_Feature Effects/Effect_ Encroaching Presence|Effect: Encroaching Presence]]

**Mild Backlash** Something inexplicable touches your mind, leaving you with lingering horror. You become [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 3]].

**Moderate Backlash** Disorienting visions and figments cover your vision, as if you're seeing through another set of alien senses. For 10 minutes, all creatures become [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] to you as they are covered in visual distortions only you can see.

**Severe Backlash** Your life force is siphoned away as the presence tugs your soul to wherever it resides. You become [[Conditions/Doomed|Doomed 1]] and [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 2]] until your next daily preparations.
