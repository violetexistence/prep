# Warfare Expertise
## Feat 3
### [[commander]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Your knowledge of war and strategy grows and guides your decisions in battle. You gain expert proficiency in Warfare Lore. You can use Warfare Lore to [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] about most creatures regardless of type, but typically only to determine whether they can be reasoned with, their most notable offensive abilities, and whether one of their saving throws is particularly weak. In addition, as long as you are observing at least one opponent when initiative is rolled, you can use Warfare Lore for your initiative roll.
