# Tempest-Sun Mages
## Feat 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[wizard]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Tempest-Sun Mages prize physical courage as well as intellectual bravery. They feel called to defend against threats of all kinds, from tyranny and invasion to intellectual subversion and bullying. Generally having a keen sense of justice, they stand up for the downtrodden and step up whenever danger presents itself. Their classes often feature heated debates that occasionally spill over into rivalries and duels outside of class. Seeing themselves as the direct heirs to the power that the Ten Magic Warriors used to transform the world, Tempest-Sun Mages tend to see magic as a fundamental power in the service of a larger purpose to extend justice and create a better world, focusing on magic that invokes the power of the sun and strengthens their own resolve.
