# Weapon Tricks
## Feat 5
### [[rogue]]

**Category** classfeature; 




You gain expert proficiency in simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks. When you critically succeed at an attack roll against an [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] creature while using an agile or finesse weapon or an agile or finesse unarmed attack, you apply the critical specialization effect for that weapon or unarmed attack.
