# Initiate Benefit (Tome)
## Feat 1
### [[thaumaturge]]

**Category** classfeature; 




While you hold your tome, lines of text appear on the open pages, revealing useful information. While you hold your tome, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to all skill checks to Recall Knowledge.

During your daily preparations, you can gain the trained proficiency rank in two skills of your choice until you prepare again. You retain the benefit as long as the tome is on your person, even if you aren't holding it. At 3rd level, you're an expert in one of the skills and trained in the other, and at 5th level, you're an expert in both skills. Since these proficiencies are temporary, you can't use them as a prerequisite for a skill increase or a permanent character option like a feat.
