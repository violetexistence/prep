# Adept Benefit (Amulet)
## Feat 7
### [[thaumaturge]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Your amulet offers continued protection. When you use [[Actions/Amulet's Abeyance|Amulet's Abeyance]], you or your ally chooses one type of damage dealt by the triggering attack and gains resistance 5 against that damage type until the start of your next turn. At 15th level, this lingering resistance increases from 5 to 10.
