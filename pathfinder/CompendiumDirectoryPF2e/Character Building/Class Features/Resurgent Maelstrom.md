# Resurgent Maelstrom
## Feat 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[magus]]

**Category** classfeature; 




While fate may conspire to strip you of your armaments, you're never helpless. For you, anything can be a dangerous weapon, bolstered by the might of towering waves and crushing tides. You know these tools are transient, and so you think nothing of shattering and reforming them with your magic.

Your attacks with improvised weapons do not take the normal â€“2 item penalty. While you wield an improvised weapon, streams of water flow from your limbs to surround the weapon, granting it the water trait. These improvised weapons have a minimum damage die of 1d6, or 1d4 if the improvised weapon is agile.

Effects that apply runes to your unarmed attacks, like [[Spells/Runic Body|Runic Body]] and [[Equipment/Handwraps of Mighty Blows|Handwraps of Might Blows]], also apply those runes to your non-magical improvised weapons. The improvised weapon also gains an additional trait, depending on how many hands it takes to wield. A one-handed improvised weapon gains the backstabber trait; if it would already have the backstabber trait, double the amount of additional precision damage. A two-handed improvised weapon gains the forceful trait; if it would already have the forceful trait, treat the number of weapon damage dice the weapon has as 1 higher for the purpose of calculating the additional damage.

While you're in Arcane Cascade stance , you can manipulate the water around your improvised weapon, making it cut like a knife or bash with the force of falling rocks. The weapon gains the versatile traits for the types of damage that it doesn't normally deal. For instance, an improvised weapon that normally deals bludgeoning damage gains the versatile P and versatile S traits.
