# Blight
## Feat 1
### [[oracle]]

**Category** classfeature; 




A spring bud will wither, a mighty oak will crash to the forest floor, and a callow youth will grow into maturity, then decline into old age. You know none of these things are cause for alarm or sadness. Decay is an essential part of nature's cycle, as the old pass away to make room for, or to nourish, the new. After all, the flower must fall for the seed to grow, and the toppled tree not only makes room for new saplings to flourish, but also forms a home for many types of flora, fauna, and fungi. Disease, poison, and rotâ€”these are all tools to dispose of creatures that have come to the end of their usefulness that rest in your hands. You might wield them to bring an end to lingering suffering or to spread contagion over once-thriving lands. Well-meaning doctors, persistent healers, or zealous adventurers may try to stand in your way, but blight will spread in the end.

If you follow a deity, you might work toward the sinister ends of Rider of Disease Apollyon, the demon lord Cyth-V'sug, or the parasitic Ghlaunder. You might find allies among followers of Groetus or the cults of the Outer Gods. If you see your calling as part of the cycle of existence, you might venerate monitor demigods such as Mother Vulture or commune with nature.
