# Dragon Instinct
## Feat 1
### [[barbarian]]

**Category** classfeature; 




You summon the fury of a mighty dragon and manifest incredible abilities. Perhaps your culture reveres draconic majesty, or you gained insights by drinking or bathing in dragon's blood or watching a marauding wyrm burn your village. Select a type of dragon from the Dragon Instincts table as your instinct's dragon type. These are the dragons from Monster Core, but your GM might allow you to choose dragons from other sources and determine their tradition and dragon breath type.

**Instinct Abilityâ€”Draconic Rage** While raging, you can increase the additional damage from Rage from 2 to 4 and change its damage type to match that of your instinct's dragon breath instead of the damage type for your weapon or unarmed attack. If you do this, your Rage action gains the trait matching your dragon instinct's tradition, as well as the trait matching the damage type where applicable.

**Specialization Ability (7th)** When you use draconic rage, you increase the additional damage from Rage from 4 to 8. If you have greater weapon specialization, instead increase the damage from Rage when using draconic rage from 8 to 16.

**Raging Resistance (9th)** You resist piercing damage and the damage type of your instinct's dragon breath.
