# Demagogue's Calling
## Feat 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[calling]][[mythic]]

**Category** calling; 




Words flow freely from a font within your soul. When you attempt a check to [[Actions/Coerce|Coerce]] or [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]], you can spend a Mythic Point to attempt the check at mythic proficiency. The first time each day that you critically succeed on a check to Coerce a creature who isn't your ally, [[Actions/Create a Diversion|Create a Diversion]] using your words, or Make an Impression on an indifferent or unfriendly audience, you regain a Mythic Point.

**Edicts** tell stories to audiences who have never heard them before, use words rather than weapons to resolve conflicts

**Anathema** interrupt someone telling a story, resort to violent action without trying to defuse the situation with your words
