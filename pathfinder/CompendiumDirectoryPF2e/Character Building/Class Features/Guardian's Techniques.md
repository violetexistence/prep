# Guardian's Techniques
## Feat 1
### [[guardian]]

**Category** classfeature; 




As a guardian, you have learned certain techniques to help keep your allies safe.

### Ever Ready

You always gain a reaction whenever you roll initiative for combat, but you can use it only for reactions from guardian feats or class features. The GM might still rule that you can use other reactions before your first turn based on the situation, as normal.

### Intercept Attack

You keep your charges safe from harm, even if it means you get hurt yourself. You gain the [[Actions/Intercept Attack|Intercept Attack]] reaction.
