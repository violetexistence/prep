# School of Ars Grammatica
## Feat 1
### [[wizard]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Runes and wards, numbers and lettersâ€”they underpin all magic, making them the logical subject for a wizard who studies fundamental forces. Perhaps you studied at the Pathfinder Society's School of Spells or a similar institution, but whether you're lacing your words with magic to compel others, casting wards around your workshop, or destabilizing the very structure of an opponent's spells, you know this unassuming school carries elegant power.
