# Paragon Benefit (Amulet)
## Feat 17
### [[thaumaturge]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Your amulet provides sanctuary even against wide-scale attacks. When you use [[Actions/Amulet's Abeyance|Amulet's Abeyance]], you target yourself and all allies within 15 feet. Each target gains both the initial resistance against the triggering damage and the lingering resistance from your amulet's adept benefit; the allies gain the lingering resistance even if they would not have taken any of the initial triggering damage.

If the foe's attack deals multiple damage types, each target can separately choose the damage type to gain lingering resistance against.
