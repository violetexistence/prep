## Feat 1
### [[flourish]][[monk]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Make two unarmed Strikes. If both hit the same creature, combine their damage for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses. Apply your multiple attack penalty to the Strikes normally. As a flourish ability, you can use Flurry of Blows only once per turn.
