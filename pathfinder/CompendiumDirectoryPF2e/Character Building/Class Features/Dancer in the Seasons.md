# Dancer in the Seasons
## Feat 7
### [[exemplar]]

**Category** classfeature; 




You flourish in spring and idle in summer, give in fall and take in winter. You gain the [[Feats/Energized Spark|Energized Spark]] feat for your choice of cold, fire, void, or wood. When you critically succeed on a Strike, you can Step as a free action in a whirl of leaves, snow, blossoms, or shimmering heat. The season changes, rotating each time you use this ability.

When you Spark Transcendence, you gain temporary Hit Points equal to half your level as you are reinvigorated by the changing of the seasons; these temporary Hit Points last until the start of your next turn.
