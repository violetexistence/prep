# Paragon Benefit (Weapon)
## Feat 17
### [[thaumaturge]]

**Category** classfeature; 




The way your implement connects to your foe makes its interruptions incredibly disruptive. You now disrupt the triggering action on a hit with [[Actions/Implement's Interruption|Implement's Interruption]], rather than needing a critical hit.
