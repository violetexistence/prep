# Steward of Stone and Fire
## Feat 1
### [[animist]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Stewards of stone and fire linger near volcanoes and deep places near the heart of the earth, hot springs where the water is too scorchingly hot to allow casual enjoyment, and other places where the barrier between fire and earth is thin or nonexistent, though particularly old rock formations, canyons, and other natural features of earth may also spawn or attract them. Stewards of stone and fire are quick to anger and slow to forget.
