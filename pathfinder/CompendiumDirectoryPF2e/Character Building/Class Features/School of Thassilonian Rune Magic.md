# School of Thassilonian Rune Magic
## Feat 1
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[wizard]]

**Category** classfeature; 




This curriculum, taught at a few select academies in New Thassilon, can be learned only by wizards with the runelord class archetype. You have begun to study one of the seven runes of sin, granting you great power but at the cost of anathematic magic. All runelords gain the below curriculum and school spells.

In addition, you must choose one of the seven sins to specialize in. You add your sin's spells and initial school spells to your curriculum. The addictive nature of sin magic prevents you from using magic in ways aligned with other sins, represented by that sin's anathema. Casting a sin spell never invokes the anathema of its school of sin.

Unlike other wizards, some of your curriculum spells may be spells that don't typically appear on the arcane spell list (marked with an asterisk). You still cast these spells as arcane spells, the unifying knowledge of sin bridging the gap between disparate magics.
