# Thief's Calling
## Feat 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[calling]][[mythic]]

**Category** calling; 




Whether guildmaster or cutpurse, you covet something, or many things, that don't belong to you, and you're driven to ever greater heights of larceny. When you attempt to [[Actions/Pick a Lock|Pick a Lock]] or [[Actions/Steal|Steal]] an item, you can spend a Mythic Point to attempt the check at mythic proficiency. The first time each day that you critically succeed on a check to Pick a Lock or Steal from a hostile creature, you regain a Mythic Point.

* * *

**Edicts** seek opportunities to overcome evermore dangerous and complex locks and mechanical defenses, steal things from dangerous creatures or places

**Anathema** leave unattended treasure where you found it, pass up opportunities for profit that challenge your skills
