# Artisan's Calling
## Feat 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[calling]][[mythic]]

**Category** calling; 




You feel an urge that echoes throughout your being to create, and one day you know you shall craft an achievement surpassing anything the world has ever seen. When you [[Actions/Craft|Craft]] or [[Actions/Repair|Repair]] an object (including vehicles and structures), you can spend a Mythic Point to attempt the check at mythic proficiency. The first time each day that you critically succeed on a check to Repair an object, you regain a Mythic Point.

* * *

**Edicts** be the first to test an item or weapon crafted with your own hands, seek out or innovate formulas for evermore complex creations

**Anathema** destroy the creations of other artisans, refuse an earnest request to repair something that has been broken, use a weapon or item crafted by someone else, except for the purpose of learning its function so you can understand how to create it yourself
