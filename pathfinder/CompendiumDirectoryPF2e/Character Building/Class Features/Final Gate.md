# Final Gate
## Feat 19
### [[kineticist]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Your kinetic gate reaches a perfect form, its power constantly fighting to be released. If your kinetic aura is inactive, you automatically use the first action of your turn to [[Actions/Channel Elements|Channel Elements]] as a free action. You can deliberately suppress the effect. If you're unable to act, final gate still functions, but you don't get to use the [[Actions/Elemental Blast|Elemental Blast]] or stance impulse you normally do from using Channel Elements
