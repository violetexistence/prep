# Water Gate
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** classfeature; 




  

| Water Gate Junction |
| --- |
| **Critical Blast** The blast deals 2 splash per damage die of the blast, with the same damage type. |
| **Elemental Resistance** fire, water |
| **Impulse Junction** After the impulse's other effects, you can move one creature targeted by the impulse or in its area 5 feet in any direction, or 10 feet if it's in a body of water. This can't move the creature into the air. You can choose only a creature that's willing to be moved, that failed its save against the impulse, or that you succeeded at an impulse attack roll against. |
| **Aura Junction** The aura becomes saturated with humidity, and water moves as you please. Non-magical fires in the aura are extinguished, and creatures in the aura gain fire resistance equal to half your level. |
| **Skill Junction** Athletics, [[Feats/Underwater Marauder\|Underwater Marauder]] |
