# Hunter's Calling
## Feat 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[calling]][[mythic]]

**Category** calling; 




You're the hunter, and somewhere, a legendary predator awaits as your ultimate challenge. When you attempt a check to [[Actions/Seek|Seek]] or [[Actions/Track|Track]], you can spend a Mythic Point to attempt the check at mythic proficiency. The first time each day that you critically succeed on a check to Seek or Track a hostile or unfriendly creature, you regain a Mythic Point.

**Edicts** be first in a group to scout an unknown and potentially dangerous area, seek out creatures that are causing imbalances in the natural world and correct the imbalance

**Anathema** leave an animal or beast you've wounded free to cause future harm, refuse a request to hunt a dangerous animal or beast
