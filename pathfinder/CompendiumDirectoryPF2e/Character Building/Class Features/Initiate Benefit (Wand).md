# Initiate Benefit (Wand)
## Feat 1
### [[thaumaturge]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Your wand slowly collects ambient magic, which you can project at a foe in a barely controlled display of charged energy. When you gain this implement, choose whether your wand is attuned to cold, electricity, or fire. You gain the [[Actions/Fling Magic|Fling Magic]] activity.
