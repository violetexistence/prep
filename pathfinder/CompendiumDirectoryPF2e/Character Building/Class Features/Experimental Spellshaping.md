# Experimental Spellshaping
## Feat 1
### [[wizard]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Your thesis posits that the magical practice of spellshaping can be realized more efficiently by altering variables and parameters as you cast, imitating the wizards of long ago who had to work out their own spells themselves. This allows you efficient access to various spellshape effects.

You gain one 1st-level spellshape wizard feat of your choice. Starting at 4th level, during your daily preparations, you can gain a spellshape wizard feat of your choice that has a level requirement of no more than half your level, which you can use until your next daily preparations.
