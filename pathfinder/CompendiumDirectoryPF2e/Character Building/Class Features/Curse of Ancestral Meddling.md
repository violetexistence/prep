# Curse of Ancestral Meddling
## Feat 1
### [[curse]][[divine]][[oracle]][[spirit]]

**Category** classfeature; 




The ancestral spirits you commune with haunt you and meddle with your belongings and actions, either out of a wellintentioned (but ultimately detrimental) attempt to assist you, as punishment for your audacity in circumventing the traditional means of achieving divine power, for their own amusement, or a mixture of the above. When you have the [[Conditions/Cursebound|Cursebound]] condition, you are [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy]] with a value equal to your cursebound value as the spirits of your ancestors temporarily possess you and vie for control in your mind, hindering your movements.
