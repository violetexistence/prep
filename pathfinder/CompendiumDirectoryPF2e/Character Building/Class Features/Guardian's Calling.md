# Guardian's Calling
## Feat 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[calling]][[mythic]]

**Category** calling; 




Your instinctive urge is always to protect others, pushing back aggressors and doing everything in your power to prevent them from harming your allies and charges. When you attempt to [[Actions/Disarm|Disarm]], [[Actions/Reposition|Reposition]], or [[Actions/Shove|Shove]] an opponent, you can spend a Mythic Point to make the check at mythic proficiency. You can attempt these maneuvers against a creature of any size when performing them at mythic proficiency. The first time each day that you critically succeed on a check to Disarm, Reposition, or Shove an opponent, you regain a Mythic Point.

**Edicts** place yourself in harm's way to protect your allies or innocent creatures under threat

**Anathema** retreat from a battle while your allies or innocent bystanders are in danger without taking every reasonable effort to rescue them first
