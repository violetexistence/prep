# Echoes of the Swords
## Feat 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[calling]][[mythic]]

**Category** calling; 




The prowess of Swordmasters past flows through you. When you Climb, [[Actions/Force Open|Force Open]], [[Actions/High Jump|High Jump]], [[Actions/Long Jump|Long Jump]], or Swim, you can spend a Mythic Point to make the check at mythic proficiency. The first time each day that you critically succeed on an Athletics check while Climbing, Forcing Open, High Jumping, Long Jumping, or Swimming, you regain a Mythic Point.
