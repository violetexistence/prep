# Military Expertise
## Feat 5
### [[commander]]

**Category** classfeature; 




You've studied in a wide variety of weapons and learned to apply their principles in combat. Your proficiency rank for martial weapons, simple weapons, and unarmed attacks increases to expert. When you critically succeed at an attack roll with a weapon you are at least an expert with, you apply the weapon's critical specialization effect.
