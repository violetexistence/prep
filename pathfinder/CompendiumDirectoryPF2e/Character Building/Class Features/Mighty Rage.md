# Mighty Rage
## Feat 11
### [[barbarian]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Your rage intensifies and lets you hit harder at the start of a fight. Your proficiency rank for your barbarian class DC increases to expert. In addition, when you use Quick-Tempered, the first Strike you make during your first turn deals additional damage equal to your [[Actions/Rage|Rage]] damage.
