# Way of the Triggerbrand
## Feat 1
### [[gunslinger]]

**Category** classfeature; 




You prefer firearms that work well as weapons in both melee and ranged combat, particularly those that allow you to exercise a bit of style and flair. You might be a survivor who cobbled your weapon together from the City of Smog's street scrap or a noble wielder of a master smith's bespoke commission for duels among Alkenstar's elite. You gain access to combination weapons.
