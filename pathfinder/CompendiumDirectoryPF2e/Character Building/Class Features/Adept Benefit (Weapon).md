# Adept Benefit (Weapon)
## Feat 7
### [[thaumaturge]]

**Category** classfeature; 




When your implement lashes out at your foe, even a close miss brings the weapon close enough to do harm. When you use [[Actions/Implement's Interruption|Implement's Interruption]] and fail (but don't critically fail) the Strike, you deal 1 damage of the weapon's normal type, possibly applying any bonus damage due to the target's weakness.
