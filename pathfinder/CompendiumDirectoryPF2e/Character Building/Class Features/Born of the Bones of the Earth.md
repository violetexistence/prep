# Born of the Bones of the Earth
## Feat 7
### [[exemplar]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Your dominion is over stone and soil, the pillars holding up the stage of history's great legends. You gain the [[Feats/Energized Spark|Energized Spark]] feat for your choice of earth or fire. When you critically succeed on a Strike and the target of the critical hit is standing on a surface of earth or stone, the target is driven down and mired in the ground. The target is [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] and must succeed at an [[Actions/Escape|Escape]] attempt against your class DC to end the immobilization. The creature doesn't become stuck if it is incorporeal, is liquid (like a water elemental or some oozes), has a burrow speed, or could otherwise escape without effort.

When you Spark Transcendence while standing on a surface of earth or stone, you can choose to shatter the surface in a 10-foot emanation, making it difficult terrain. You are not affected by this difficult terrain.
