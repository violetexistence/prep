# Rune Capacity
## Feat 15
### [[inventor]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Whether you've done some dabbling in orichalcum alloys or found another engineering solution, you've built your innovation in such a way that it can hold an additional property rune. Your innovation can have one more property rune than a normal item of its kind (to a maximum of four property runes with a +3 _potency_ armor).
