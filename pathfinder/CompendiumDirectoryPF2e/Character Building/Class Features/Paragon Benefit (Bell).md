# Paragon Benefit (Bell)
## Feat 17
### [[thaumaturge]]

**Category** classfeature; 




With your mastery of your bell, you can affect many foes with ease. All the condition values from [[Actions/Ring Bell|Ring Bell]] increase to 2 (or 3 on a critical failure). Ring Bell can trigger off the Strike or spell of any enemy, not just the target of your [[Actions/Exploit Vulnerability|Exploit Vulnerability]]; however, in that case, the condition lasts only until the start of your next turn.
