# Third Apparition
## Feat 7
### [[animist]]

**Category** classfeature; 




You've learned to shelter more spirits, gaining access to more magic. When you attune to apparitions during your daily preparations, you choose three apparitions to attune to, with one of them being your primary apparition. The number of Focus Points in your focus pool increases by 1 (maximum 3).
