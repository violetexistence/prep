# Commanding Will
## Feat 11
### [[commander]]

**Category** classfeature; 




You know that if you break, so too will those who follow you, and so you have cultivated a will that bends to no outside force. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.
