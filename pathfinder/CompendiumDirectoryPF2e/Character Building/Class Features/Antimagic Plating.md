# Antimagic Plating
## Feat 7
### [[inventor]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Whether you used some clever adaptation of the magic-negating skymetal known as noqual or created magical protections of your own design, you've strengthened your armor against magic. While wearing the armor, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to all saving throws against spells and to AC against spells. Against spells that target the armor directly, you instead gain a +4 circumstance bonus to all saving throws and to AC.
