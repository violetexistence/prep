# Spell Blending
## Feat 1
### [[wizard]]

**Category** classfeature; 




You theorize that spell slots are a shorthand for an underlying energy that powers all spellcasting, and you've found a way to tinker with the hierarchy of spell slots, combining them to fuel more powerful spells.

During your daily preparations, you can trade two spell slots of the same spell rank for a bonus spell slot of up to 2 spell ranks higher than the traded spell slots. You can exchange as many spell slots as you have available. Bonus spell slots must be of a spell rank you can normally cast, and each bonus spell slot must be of a different spell rank. You can also trade any spell slot for two additional cantrips, though you can't trade more than one spell slot at a time for additional cantrips in this way.
