# Battledancer
## Feat 1
### [[swashbuckler]]

**Category** classfeature; 




To you, a fight is a kind of performance art, and you command your foes' attention with mesmerizing motions. You are trained in Performance and gain the [[Feats/Fascinating Performance|Fascinating Performance]] skill feat. When you [[Actions/Perform|Perform]], the action gains the bravado trait.
