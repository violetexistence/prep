# Sacred Body
## Feat 9
### [[champion]]

**Category** classfeature; 




The power of your deity keeps your body safe from harm, as true an edifice of the faith as a great temple. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.
