This shield is polished so brightly it can reflect even spiritual and ethereal attacks.

**Immanence** (aura) The mirrored aegis emits an aura in a 15-foot emanation that protects you and all allies in the aura from harm, granting a +1 status bonus to AC. If the mirrored aegis houses your divine spark for 10 uninterrupted minutes, it is restored to full Hit Points.
