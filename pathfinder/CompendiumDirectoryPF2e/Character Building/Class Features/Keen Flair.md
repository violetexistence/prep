# Keen Flair
## Feat 15
### [[swashbuckler]]

**Category** classfeature; 




You inflict particularly devastating attacks on even well-defended foes. When you Strike with a weapon or unarmed attack with which you have master proficiency, if you roll a 19 on the die and the roll is a success, you critically succeed instead.
