# Formula Book
## Feat 1
### [[alchemist]]

**Category** classfeature; 




An alchemist keeps meticulous formulas for every item they can create. You start with a standard [[Equipment/Formula Book (Blank)|Formula Book]] for free. The formula book contains the formulas for two common 1st-level alchemical items of your choice, in addition to any formulas you gained from [[Feats/Alchemical Crafting|Alchemical Crafting]] and your research field.

Each time you gain a level, you can add the formulas for two common alchemical items to your formula book. These new formulas can be for any level of item you can create. You learn these formulas automatically, but it's also possible to find or buy additional formulas in settlements or from other alchemists, or to select the [[Feats/Inventor|Inventor]] skill feat so you can invent them.

As normal, having the base formula is sufficient when Crafting upgraded types of the itemâ€”you don't need to learn higher-level formulas. For instance, if you have the 1st-level formula for a minor elixir of life, you can create a minor, lesser, moderate, greater, major, or true elixir of life as long as you meet the level and other prerequisites. Items with type entries that have widely varied functions require separate formulas, but most alchemical items have a structure similar to elixir of life.
