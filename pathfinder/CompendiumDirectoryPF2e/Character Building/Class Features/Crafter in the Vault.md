# Crafter in the Vault
## Feat 1
### [[animist]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Crafters in the vault are found in dungeons, forges, or other places where creation and injury occur concurrently. They enjoy partnering with animists who compliment them on their creations, but often become jealous when anyone else intrudes on their expertise, including casting any of the spells that appear on their apparition list.
