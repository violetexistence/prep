# Adept Benefit (Regalia)
## Feat 7
### [[thaumaturge]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Your regalia's power increases, and so do the abilities it grants. The circumstance bonus you gain to Deception, Diplomacy, and Intimidation increases to +2, as long as you have master proficiency in each skill. When others use Follow the Expert to follow you, you grant them a +2 circumstance bonus if you are trained, +3 if you have expert proficiency, or +4 if you have master or legendary proficiency.

The courage your aura instills grows stronger. The +1 status bonus now applies to all saving throws against mental effects, rather than only against fear, and you and allies in your aura gain a +2 status bonus to damage rolls. At 11th level, this increases to a +3 status bonus to damage rolls, and at 17th level, this increases to a +4 status bonus to damage rolls.
