# Adept Benefit (Chalice)
## Feat 7
### [[thaumaturge]]

**Category** classfeature; 




The life essence shed from blood empowers your chalice. If you or an ally within 30 feet takes piercing or slashing damage from a foe's critical hit or takes persistent bleed damage, [[Actions/Drink from the Chalice|Drinking from the Chalice]] before the end of your next turn grants that injured creature greater restoration to make up for its lost vitality. On a sip, the temporary Hit Points granted to the creature increase to 2 + your Charisma modifier + your level. When drained, the chalice heals the creature 5 Hit Points for each level you have.
