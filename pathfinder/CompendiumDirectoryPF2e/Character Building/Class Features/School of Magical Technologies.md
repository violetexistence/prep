# School of Magical Technologies
## Feat 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[wizard]]

**Category** classfeature; 




At the height of ancient Azlant, the study of magical technologies—better known as magitech—was considered among the most prestigious of arcane specializations, and practitioners were both well regarded and well paid. While some magitech specialists trained in academies or as apprentices, others studied at religious cloisters dedicated to the worship of Amaznen, a now-dead god of invention and magic. Today, practitioners are more likely to learn from scraps of ancient spellbooks, forgotten lore unearthed in Azlanti ruins, or from a time-displaced graduate like Anoreth Zorillen. Modern magitech schools exist today, divorced from their ancient Azlanti origins but no less prestigious, including the famed Clockwork Cathedral in Absalom and temples of Brigh, goddess of clockwork and invention.

As a student of magical technologies, you've learned the art of fusing magic with mundane technology to create something truly unique.
