# The Inscribed One
## Feat 1
### [[witch]]

**Category** classfeature; 




No words passed your patron's lips in the moment you met; instead, words and glyphs danced across their skin while symbols and numbers swam in the depths of their eyes, spelling out their will in a torrent of words and wisdom. Your patron might be a powerful archmage, or even one of their abandoned artifacts, searching for a successor.

**Spell List** arcane

**Patron Skill** Arcana

**Lesson of Glyph's Supremacy** Your patron teaches that the written word can accomplish so much more than it seems. You gain the [[Spells/Discern Secrets|Discern Secrets]] hex and your familiar learns [[Spells/Runic Weapon|Runic Weapon]].

**Familiar of Flowing Script** Your familiar is covered in a pattern that looks similar to letters in an unknown language, one that seems to draw attention even as it eludes understanding. When you Cast or Sustain a hex, the letters begin to rapidly change, causing a distraction. Until the start of your next turn, your familiar can provide flanking for you and your allies as though it were able to attack and had a reach of 5 feet; this is a visual effect.
