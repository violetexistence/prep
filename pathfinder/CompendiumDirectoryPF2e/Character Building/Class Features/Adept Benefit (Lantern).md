# Adept Benefit (Lantern)
## Feat 7
### [[thaumaturge]]

**Category** classfeature; 




In addition to the initiate benefits, when you hold your lantern, its light reveals the [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]] and the ethereal. The bright light increases to 30 feet, with dim light out 30 feet further. While you're holding your lantern, invisible and ethereal creatures within the bright light become visible as rippling distortions, though they're still [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]]. This doesn't give you any special ability to affect a creature on the Ethereal Plane, but it ensures you're aware of the creatures' presence.
