# Sage's Calling
## Feat 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[calling]][[mythic]]

**Category** calling; 




You're already an archive of knowledge, but you're driven to learn more with an unquenchable passion that might never be sated. When you attempt to Recall Knowledge, you can spend a Mythic Point to attempt the check at mythic proficiency. The first time each day that you critically succeed on a Recall Knowledge check against an enemy creature, you regain a Mythic Point.

**Edicts** preserve your knowledge for future generations, seek out lost knowledge in dangerous or forgotten places

**Anathema** destroy books or other repositories of knowledge, lie to hide knowledge from the world
