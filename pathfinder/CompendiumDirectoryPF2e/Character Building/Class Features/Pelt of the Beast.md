# Pelt of the Beast
## Feat 1
### [[ikon]]

**Category** classfeature; 




**Usage** worn cloak or belt

* * *

This animal hide, whether worn about the shoulders or waist, is all you need to survive even the harshest elements. When you make your daily preparations, choose cold, electricity, fire, poison, or sonic damage. The pelt attunes to that damage type.

**Immanence** You gain resistance equal to half your level to the damage type the pelt is attuned to. You also treat environmental cold and heat effects as one step less severe.

**Transcendenceâ€”**[[Actions/Survive the Wilds|Survive the Wilds]] `pf2:1` (aura, manipulate, transcendence)
