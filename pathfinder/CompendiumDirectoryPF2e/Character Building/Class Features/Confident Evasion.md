# Confident Evasion
## Feat 7
### [[swashbuckler]]

**Category** classfeature; 




You've learned to move quickly to avoid explosions, a dragon's breath, and worse. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Reflex save, you get a critical success instead.
