# The Proud
## Feat 3
### [[exemplar]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Whether out of overconfidence, a desire to protect your comrades, or the unslakable thirst for glory, you invite challengers to strike you down. You are trained in Intimidation. After you Spark Transcendence, you can boast to one enemy within 30 feet to draw its attention; this effect has the auditory, emotion, mental, and linguistic traits. Until the start of your next turn, the target takes a â€“1 status penalty to attack rolls, damage rolls, and skill checks against creatures other than you, and it gains a +1 status bonus to these rolls when targeting you.
