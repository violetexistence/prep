# Harmonic Oscillator
## Feat 1
### [[inventor]]

**Category** classfeature; 




You designed your armor to inaudibly thrum at just the right frequency to create interference against force and sound waves. You gain resistance equal to 3 + half your level to force and sonic damage. When under the effects of Overdrive, the resistance increases by 2.
