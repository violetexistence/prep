# Arcane Bond
## Feat 1
### [[wizard]]

**Category** classfeature; 




You place some of your magical power in a bonded item. Each day when you prepare your spells, you can designate a single item you own as your bonded item. This is typically an item associated with spellcasting, such as a wand, ring, or staff, but you are free to designate a weapon or other item. You gain the [[Actions/Drain Bonded Item|Drain Bonded Item]] free action.
