# Second Path to Perfection
## Feat 11
### [[monk]]

**Category** classfeature; 




You've learned to find perfection in every success. Choose a different saving throw than the one you chose for your path to perfection. Your proficiency rank for the chosen saving throw increases to master. If you roll a success with the chosen saving throw, you instead critically succeed.
