# Paragon Benefit (Lantern)
## Feat 17
### [[thaumaturge]]

**Category** classfeature; 




In addition to the other benefits, your lantern reveals all things as they truly are. The bright light increases to 40 feet, with dim light out 40 feet further. While you're holding your lantern, the GM rolls a secret counteract check against any illusion or transmutation that comes within the lantern's bright light, but only for the purpose of determining whether you and others can see through it (for instance, if the check succeeds against a polymorph spell, you can see the creature's true form, but you don't end the spell). Use half your level rounded up as the counteract rank and your class DC - 10 as the counteract modifier. On a failed counteract check, the lantern can't attempt to counteract that illusion or polymorph effect again until midnight. You can choose to leave any illusion or transmutation you discover intact, instead of counteracting it.
