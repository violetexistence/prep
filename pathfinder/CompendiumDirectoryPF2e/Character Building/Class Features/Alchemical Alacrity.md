# Alchemical Alacrity
## Feat 15
### [[alchemist]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Your comfort in concocting items is such that you can create three at a time. When using the [[Actions/Quick Alchemy|Quick Alchemy]] action, you can spend up to three batches of infused reagents to make up to three alchemical items as described in that action. These items do not have to be the same.
