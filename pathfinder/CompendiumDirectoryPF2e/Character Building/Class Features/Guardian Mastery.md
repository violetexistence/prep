# Guardian Mastery
## Feat 19
### [[guardian]]

**Category** classfeature; 




You are known for your suit of armor more than the person inside. Your proficiency rank for your guardian class DC increases to master. While wearing armor, when you attempt a Reflex save to avoid a damaging effect, such as a [[Spells/Fireball|Fireball]], you can add your armorâ€™s item bonus to AC instead of your Dexterity modifier; if your armor has the bulwark trait, increase this bonus by 1. If you get a success when you do this, you get a critical success instead.
