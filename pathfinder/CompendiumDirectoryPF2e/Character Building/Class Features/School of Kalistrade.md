# School of Kalistrade
## Feat 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[wizard]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Power and money are closely intertwined, and you recognize the potential for magic to assist in your pursuit of wealth and influence. Though you might study this school without joining the Prophets of Kalistrade, most who do so are either a part of the organization or local to Kerse and therefore used to the customs and culture of the Kalistocrats. You deploy magic to help you see through the illusions and trickery of others. At the same time, you push boundaries and exploit loopholes to get ahead of your competitors.
