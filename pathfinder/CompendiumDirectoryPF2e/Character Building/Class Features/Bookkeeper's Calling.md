# Bookkeeper's Calling
## Feat 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[calling]][[mythic]]

**Category** calling; 




Your passion and destiny are both tied to the preservation of knowledge and a deep-seated love of instruments designed to preserve and propagate knowledge, such as books and scrolls. When you attempt a check to Recall Knowledge or [[Actions/Earn Income|Earn Income]] using a Lore skill you're trained in, you can spend a Mythic Point to attempt the check at mythic proficiency. The first time each day that you critically succeed on a check to Recall Knowledge while researching in a library or similar facility, you regain a Mythic Point.

* * *

**Edicts** educate others, record new knowledge so that others can share in your discoveries

**Anathema** destroy books, scrolls, or other instruments used to record information; refuse an opportunity to share your knowledge with an earnest knowledge-seeker
