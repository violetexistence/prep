# Integrated Gauntlet
## Feat 7
### [[inventor]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Combining your weapon with a gauntlet, you make it so you can quickly switch between attacking with your weapon and tinkering using your hands. Your innovation gains the free-hand trait. This cannot be used with weapons that have the two-hand or fatal aim traits.
