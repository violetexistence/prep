# Rain-Scribes
## Feat 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[wizard]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Rain-Scribes, who seek to explore the world and especially its unknown corners, draw the closest of all the branches to primal magic in their study of the arcane. They also embrace the "practical magic" schooling that takes them off of campus, often into the wilds of the Mwangi Expanse but sometimes beyond to other continents on Golarion or even onto distant planes. Their course of magical study includes connecting with and understanding nature, working with the elements, summoning animals, and providing for their own survival.
