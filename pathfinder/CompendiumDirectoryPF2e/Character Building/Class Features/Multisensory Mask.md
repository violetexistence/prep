# Multisensory Mask
## Feat 15
### [[inventor]]

**Category** classfeature; 




**Subterfuge Suit only**

* * *

You've built a multisensory mask over your armor that protects you by distorting your figure from all senses, leaving behind only a hazy image, muffled sounds, and so forth. While wearing the armor, you gain concealment against all creatures, even if they are using a nonvisual precise sense, such as a bat's echolocation. As normal for effects that leave your location obvious, you can't use this concealment to Hide or [[Actions/Sneak|Sneak]]. If you use a hostile action, the concealment ends until you restore the mask as a single action, which has the manipulate trait.
