# Way of the Drifter
## Feat 1
### [[gunslinger]]

**Category** classfeature; 




You're a wanderer traveling from land to land with your gun and a melee weapon as company. Maybe you learned to fight with blade and pistol as a Shackles pirate, mastered the hand cannon and katana in Minkai, or practiced with a hatchet and clan pistol in Dongun Hold. You win battles by relying on mobility and flexible use of your weapons.
