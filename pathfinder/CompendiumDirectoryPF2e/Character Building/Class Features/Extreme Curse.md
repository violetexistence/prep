# Extreme Curse
## Feat 17
### [[oracle]]

**Category** classfeature; 




You have mastered a precarious balance between the conflicting divine powers of your mystery, allowing you to tolerate a perilous degree of divine curse. The maximum [[Conditions/Cursebound|Cursebound]] value you can have increases from cursebound 3 to cursebound 4.
