# Animal Instinct
## Feat 1
### [[barbarian]]

**Category** classfeature; 




The fury of a wild predator fills you when you Rage, granting you ferocious unarmed attacks. Cultures that revere vicious animals (such as apes or bears) give rise to barbarians with this instinct. You might also be at war with an uncontrollable, animalistic side of your personality, or you might be a descendant of a werewolf or another werecreature. Select an animal from the Animal Instincts table that best matches your chosen animal.

**Instinct Ability—Bestial Rage** While raging, you gain your chosen animal's unarmed attack (or attacks), but you're unable to use weapons. The specific attack gained, the damage it deals, and its traits are listed in the Animal Instincts table. These attacks are in the brawling group. Your Rage action gains the morph and primal traits.

**Specialization Ability (7th)** Increase the damage die size for the unarmed attacks granted by your chosen animal by one step, and increase the additional damage from Rage from 2 to 5 for your chosen animal's unarmed attacks. If you have greater weapon specialization, increase the damage from Rage from 5 to 12 for your chosen animal's unarmed attacks.

**Raging Resistance (9th)** You resist piercing and slashing damage.

\*The spider's web attack deals no damage, but the target takes a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds for 1 round on a hit. If a target is hit a second time by the same character's web attack while they have this penalty, they're instead [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] until they succeed at a check to [[Actions/Escape|Escape]] against your class DC.
