# Primal Hierophant
## Feat 19
### [[druid]]

**Category** classfeature; 




You command the most potent forces of primal magic and can cast a spell of truly incredible power. You gain a single 10th-rank spell slot and can prepare a spell in that slot using druid spellcasting. Unlike with other spell slots, you can't use 10-rank slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots. You don't gain more 10th-rank spells as you level up, but you can take the [[Feats/Hierophant's Power|Hierophant's Power]] feat to gain a second slot.
