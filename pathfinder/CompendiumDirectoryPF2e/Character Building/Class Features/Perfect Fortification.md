# Perfect Fortification
## Feat 15
### [[inventor]]

**Category** classfeature; 




**Power Suit only**

* * *

You've outfitted your armor with such heavy fortifications that deadly attacks often lose their edge. Each time you're critically hit while wearing the armor, attempt a `DC 13 Flat check`. On a success, it becomes a normal hit. This isn't cumulative with _fortification_ runes or other abilities that reduce critical hits with a flat check. Additionally, you gain resistance 2 + half your level against precision damage.
