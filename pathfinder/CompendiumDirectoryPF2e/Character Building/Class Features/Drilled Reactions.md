# Drilled Reactions
## Feat 1
### [[commander]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Your time spent training your allies allows them to respond quickly and instinctively to your commands. Once per round when you use a tactic, you can grant one ally of your choice benefiting from that tactic an extra reaction. This reaction has to be used for that tactic and is lost if not used.
