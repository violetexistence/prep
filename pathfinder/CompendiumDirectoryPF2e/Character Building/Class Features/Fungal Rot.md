## Feat 1
### 

**Category** classfeature; 




As you use your powers, radioactive molds and fungi consume your flesh, making you look (and feel) like a rotting, walking corpse.

**Mild Backlash** You take damage equal to your level as your body decays.

**Moderate Backlash** You take damage equal to your level and become [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]].
