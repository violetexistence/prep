# Master of Mind and Spirit
## Feat 13
### [[animist]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Your apparitions gird your mind against hostile intrusion and shield you from the effects of entities seeking to control your mind. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.
