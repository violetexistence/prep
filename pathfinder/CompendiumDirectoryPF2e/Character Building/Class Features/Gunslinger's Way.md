# Gunslinger's Way
## Feat 1
### [[gunslinger]]

**Category** classfeature; 




All gunslingers have a particular way they follow, a combination of philosophy and combat style that defines both how they fight and the weapons they excel with. At 1st level, your way grants you an initial deed, a unique reload action called a slinger's reload, and proficiency with a particular skill. You also gain advanced and greater deeds at later levels, as well as access to way-specific feats.

**[[Class Features/Way of the Drifter|Way of the Drifter]]** You wander across the battlefield, equally at home in and out of the fray.

**[[Class Features/Way of the Pistolero|Way of the Pistolero]]** You carefully maintain your distance at a duelist's 10 paces with pistol in hand.

**[[Class Features/Way of the Sniper|Way of the Sniper]]** You practice a methodical style of shooting, striking from far cover.

**[[Class Features/Way of the Vanguard|Way of the Vanguard]]** You rely on a brutal combat style that uses heavy weapons and explosive attacks.

**[[Class Features/Way of the Triggerbrand|Way of the Triggerbrand]]** You prefer firearms that work well as weapons in both melee and ranged combat
