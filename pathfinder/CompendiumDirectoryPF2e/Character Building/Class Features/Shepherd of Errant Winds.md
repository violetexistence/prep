# Shepherd of Errant Winds
## Feat 1
### [[animist]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Often spun from eddies in the wake of air elementals, a shepherd of errant winds delights in movement and freedom. They might seek animists in breezy canyons or aboard ships cruising the trade winds, after which the apparition follows an animist to less airy locales. However, a shepherd of errant winds chafes at idleness and stirs up trouble if its surroundings seem too still.
