# Greater Unassailable Soul
## Feat 13
### [[exemplar]]

**Category** classfeature; 




A wall of confidence blunts every arrow seeking to pierce your mind. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to legendary. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success. When you roll a critical failure at a Will save, you get a failure instead. When you fail a Will save against a damaging effect, you take half damage.
