# Handler's Calling
## Feat 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[calling]][[mythic]]

**Category** calling; 




You have an instinctive urge to care for wild creatures. When you attempt a check to [[Actions/Command an Animal|Command an Animal]], you can spend a Mythic Point to attempt the check at mythic proficiency. The first time each day that you critically succeed on a check to [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] on a wild animal or Command an Animal who isn't your pet or companion, you regain a Mythic Point.
