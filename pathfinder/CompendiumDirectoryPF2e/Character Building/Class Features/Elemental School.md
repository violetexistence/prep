# Elemental School
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** classfeature; 




If you choose an elemental school, your curriculum spells can be any spells that you have access to and that have your chosen element's trait. Your school spells are the elemental focus spells of your chosen element, with the 1st-rank spell as your initial school spell and the 3rd-rank spell as the advanced school spell.
