# Echoes of the Scrolls
## Feat 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[calling]][[mythic]]

**Category** calling; 




The comprehension of Scrollmasters past flows through you. When you Decipher Writing, Gather Information, or [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]], you can spend a Mythic Point to make the check at mythic proficiency. The first time each day that you critically succeed on any check while Deciphering Writing, Gathering Information, or Recalling Knowledge, you regain a Mythic Point.
