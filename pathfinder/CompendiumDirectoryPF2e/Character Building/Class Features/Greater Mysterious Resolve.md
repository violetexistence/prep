# Greater Mysterious Resolve
## Feat 17
### [[oracle]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Your time spent in contemplation of the mysteries of creation has given you a powerful mind and soul. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to legendary. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead. When you roll a critical failure on a Will save, you get a failure instead. When you fail a Will save against a damaging effect, you take half damage.
