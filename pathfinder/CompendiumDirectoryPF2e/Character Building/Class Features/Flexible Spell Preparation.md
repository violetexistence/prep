# Flexible Spell Preparation
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** classfeature; 



**Prerequisites** You must have a class, such as clerics, druids, witches, and wizards, that prepares spells in spell slots using the same number of prepared spells per day.
* * *
This class feature alters your spellcasting class feature (such as Arcane Spellcasting for the wizard or Divine Spellcasting for the cleric). If you choose this class archetype, you must select [[Feats/Flexible Spellcaster Dedication|Flexible Spellcaster Dedication]] as your 2nd-level class feat.

*   You can cast fewer spells each day. Your number of spell slots per day don't advance from 2 to 3 spells at even levels.
*   Reduce the number of cantrips you gain from your class by 2. This archetype doesn't change the way you prepare cantrips.
*   During your daily preparations, you prepare a spell collection rather than preparing spells into each spell slot individually. The number of spells in your spell collection each day equals the total number of spell slots you get each day from your class spells. Select these spells from the same source as normal, such as from a spellbook for a wizard.
*   You can cast any of the spells in your collection by using a spell slot of an appropriate level. For instance, if you were level 1 and had [[Spells/Gentle Landing|Gentle Landing]] and [[Spells/Force Barrage|Force Barrage]] in your spell collection, you could cast _gentle landing_ twice that day, _force barrage_ twice, or each spell once.
*   Extra spell slots you gain that have additional restrictions, like the wizard's specialist school spells or the cleric's divine font spells, don't change due to this archetype, nor do such spells count toward the number of spells you place in your spell collection.
