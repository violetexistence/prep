# Versatile Vials
## Feat 1
### [[alchemist]]

**Category** classfeature; 




You know how to prepare fast-acting chemicals into versatile vials, special items that can be used as bombs and be turned into other alchemical items by introducing special reagents. During your daily preparations, you can create a number of versatile vials up to 2 + your Intelligence modifier, which is also your maximum number of vials. If you're below your maximum number, you can gather reagents from the environment around you. For every 10 minutes you spend in exploration mode, you regain 2 vials; this doesn't prevent you from participating in other exploration activities.

Versatile vials are infused items, and are destroyed if not used by the next time you make your daily preparations. A vial you create is always the highest type you could Craft. See the sidebar for statistics on using a versatile vial as a bomb. You can also use vials for [[Class Features/Quick Alchemy|Quick Alchemy]] and your research field can add to the ways you can use a vial.

You can store all your versatile vials within your [[Equipment/Alchemist's Toolkit|Alchemist's Toolkit]], with no increase to its Bulk. Though versatile vials are physical objects, they can't be duplicated or preserved in any way.
