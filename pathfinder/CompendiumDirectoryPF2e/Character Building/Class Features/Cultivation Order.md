# Cultivation Order
## Feat 1
### [[druid]]

**Category** classfeature; 




You believe that nature is best tended, pruned, and maintained. Nature is inherently random and chaotic out of necessity of survivalâ€”the flower spreads its seeds far and wide, hoping that some might sprout, but you believe that plants truly thrive in orderly environments. Thus, you lend a hand, decluttering that which is stagnant, planting in ideal locations, replanting that which grows in suboptimal locations, mulching the soil, and performing other maintenance. While many druids might consider your approach "meddling" or "unnatural," you know that the work you do is vital for the overall health of the environment you tend.

You're trained in Crafting. You also gain the Leshy Familiar druid feat. You gain the cornucopia order spell. Committing wanton cruelty to plants or fungi or neglecting to nurture plants in need of tending is anathema to your order. This doesn't prevent you from killing plants or fungi and it doesn't prevent you from defending yourself against plants or fungi.

**Special**: The cultivation order is a variant of the leaf order. If you have the cultivation order, you count as a member of the leaf order, and you qualify for leaf order feats.
