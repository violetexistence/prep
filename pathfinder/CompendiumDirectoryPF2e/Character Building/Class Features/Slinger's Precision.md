# Slinger's Precision
## Feat 1
### [[gunslinger]]

**Category** classfeature; 




You deal an extra +2 precision damage with Strikes made using non-repeating crossbows and you deal an extra 1d4 precision damage on Strikes using non-repeating firearms.

If you have gunslinging legend, you instead deal +3 additional precision damage with Strikes using non-repeating crossbows and an additional 1d6 precision damage with Strikes using non-repeating firearms.

If you are using a combination weapon whose ranged form is a firearm or crossbow, you use your proficiency with firearms and crossbows for attacks made with the melee configuration of that weapon.
