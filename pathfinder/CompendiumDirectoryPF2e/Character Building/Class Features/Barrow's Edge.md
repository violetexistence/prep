# Barrow's Edge
## Feat 1
### [[ikon]]

**Category** classfeature; 




**Usage** melee weapon that deals slashing or piercing damage

* * *

This blade subtly rattles in its scabbard, as if it wants to be unsheathed so it can consume violence.

**Immanence** The barrow's edge deals 1 additional spirit damage per weapon damage die to a creature it Strikes. If the creature is below half its maximum Hit Points, the weapon deals 3 additional spirit damage per weapon damage dice instead. Barrow's edge rattles more strongly when an enemy below half its maximum Hit Points is within the weapon's reach to let you know a foe is verging closer to death.

**Transcendenceâ€”**[[Actions/Drink of my Foes|Drink of my Foes]] `pf2:1` (healing, transcendence, vitality)

[[Actions/Drink of my Foes]]
