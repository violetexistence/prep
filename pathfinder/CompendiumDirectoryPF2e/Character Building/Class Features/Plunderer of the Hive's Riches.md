# Plunderer of the Hive's Riches
## Feat 7
### [[exemplar]]

**Category** classfeature; 




You take what's yours, even if an army should stand in your way. You gain the [[Feats/Energized Spark|Energized Spark]] feat, with your choice of either poison or sonic damage. When you critically succeed at a Strike, the taste of honey fills your mouth as you plunder part of your foe's vitality for yourself, gaining temporary Hit Points equal to half the creature's level that last for 1 minute.

When you Spark Transcendence, a mass of buzzing insects fill the air around you, granting you concealment until the beginning of your next turn. You can't use this concealment to [[Actions/Hide|Hide]] or [[Actions/Sneak|Sneak]], as normal for concealment when your position is still obvious.
