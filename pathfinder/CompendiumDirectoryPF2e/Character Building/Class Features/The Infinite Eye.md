# The Infinite Eye
## Feat 1
### [[psychic]]

**Category** classfeature; 




The true strength of the mind lies in the knowledge it contains, with each new observation contributing to the totality of its experiences. To grow your experiences-and with them, your power-you devote yourself to observing as much as possible, casting your senses through space and time with clairvoyance and precognition.

[[Spells/Detect Magic|Detect Magic]]

You have the kind of fine control that other spellcasters can only dream of. When you cast detect magic, you're aware of any creature in the emanation affected by a spell or carrying a magic item, and you determine the main location of magic within any magical hazard in the emanation (with the normal restrictions on detecting illusions). This typically manifests as an alteration to your vision, such as seeing a soft aura around the creature or hazard. Sensing these phenomena doesn't make it clear which spell is on a creature, nor which of its items are magical. Your detect magic also gains the following amp.

**Amp** Your pulse of detection magic helps you gain a sense of nearby magic's strengths or weaknesses. When you detect the presence of magic on an enemy or hazard, you gain a +1 status bonus to saves against magic originating from that enemy or hazard for 3 rounds. If you find magic from multiple sources with a single casting of detect magic, you get the bonus against all of them.

**Amp Heightened (7th)** The status bonus to saves against magic increases to +2.

[[Spells/Guidance|Guidance]]

You have eyes everywhere, allowing you to guide people from a great distance. The range of guidance increases to 120 feet. It also gains the following amp.

**Amp** You can project a flash of insight to your ally in the nick of time to save them from failure. Amped guidance doesn't cause a creature to become temporarily immune to guidance, and a creature can be targeted by amped guidance even if it is temporarily immune to guidance.

You can cast an amped guidance spell as a reaction triggered when your ally fails or critically fails an attack roll, Perception check, saving throw, or skill check, and the bonus from guidance would change the failure to a success or the critical failure to a normal failure. The bonus from guidance applies retroactively to their check.

**Amp Heightened (6th)** The bonus from the spell increases to +2.

**Unique Psi Cantrips**

surface: [[Spells/Glimpse Weakness|Glimpse Weakness]]

**Amp** The additional precision damage is 1d4+1.

**Amp Heightened (+2)** The additional precision damage increases by 1d4+1.

deeper: [[Spells/Omnidirectional Scan|Omnidirectional Scan]]

**Amp** Your scans are so minute that you can project your foe's likely strengths and weaknesses. You learn which of the target enemy's saving throws is highest and which is lowest, and you and all allies within 30 feet gain a +1 circumstance bonus to attacks and damage against the creature.

If you take the Aid reaction you prepared for and succeed at your roll, these bonuses increase to +2 on the attack you're Aiding. On a critical success, they increase to +3, or to +4 if you have legendary proficiency in spell attack rolls.

deepest: [[Spells/Foresee the Path|Foresee the Path]]

**Amp** The spell has the same result on a failure as on a success (but still no effect on a critical failure). Each time you [[Actions/Sustain|Sustain the Spell]], you can choose an additional ally to target, granting them the same benefit as the initial target ally.
