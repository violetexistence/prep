# The Unbound Step
## Feat 1
### [[psychic]]

**Category** classfeature; 




The mind can flit from thought to thought; why too shouldn't you? You focus on motion in a higher order of spatial dimensions, not just the typical three, allowing for versatile abilities that alter positioning.

**Standard Psi Cantrips**

[[Spells/Phase Bolt|Phase Bolt]]

Your _phase bolt_ temporarily sends the target's cover out of phase if it hits. On a success, reduce the target's circumstance bonus to AC (if any) by 1 until the beginning of your next turn. Your _phase bolt_ also gains the following amp.

**Amp** Your bolt leaves phase completely, becoming invisible and intangible until it's already embedded in the targetâ€”giving the impression it simply teleported itself into place. The target is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] against the attack. Additionally, the bolt ignores an amount of Hardness or resistance to piercing damage equal to half the spell's level. On a critical success, the target can't be affected by teleportation effects until the start of your next turn.

**Amp Heightened (+1)** The bolt's damage increases by 2d4 instead of 1d4.

[[Spells/Warp Step|Warp Step]]

You warp space more compactly, granting you a +10-foot status to your Speed instead of a +5-foot status bonus when you _warp step_. The spell also gains the following amp.

**Amp** Space contracts with hardly a thought, letting you Cast the Spell as a single action.

**Amp Heightened (4th)** You twist space so completely you don't need to travel the interposing distance. You can choose to instead teleport to a space within your line of sight and line of effect with a range equal to your double your Speed (after applying the status bonus from warp step). This grants the spell the teleportation trait.

**Unique Psi Cantrips**

surface: [[Spells/Distortion Lens|Distortion Lens]]

**Amp** The lens can interfere with creatures as well as attacks. Once during a Medium or smaller ally's move action, the ally can move into and out of the lens's square without that square counting against the total distance moved. Conversely, the lens is difficult terrain for your enemies.

deeper: [[Spells/Ghostly Shift|Ghostly Shift]]

**Amp** Your insubstantiality is complete enough that you can pass through other creatures, causing painful interference effects when you do so. Once each round when you Stride, Burrow, Swim, or Fly, you can pass through one creature's space during that action without needing to attempt a check to [[Actions/Tumble Through|Tumble Through]], though you can't end your turn in its space. When you pass through a creature's space in this way, you deal 2d6 force damage to that creature, with a basic Fortitude save.

**Amp Heightened (+2)** Increase the damage dealt by phasing through a creature by 1d6.

deepest: [[Spells/Tesseract Tunnel|Tesseract Tunnel]]

**Amp** Physical movement is no longer necessary to connect two points in space. When you cast tesseract tunnel, you simply create a tunnel that ends in a square within a range equal to your Speed; you can choose to immediately teleport to the space at the far end of the tunnel. Furthermore, the tunnel can be traversed in both directions, instead of only from entrance to exit. Finally, the spell's duration changes to 1 minute. You can Dismiss the spell.
