# Sovereignty Epithet
## Feat 15
### [[exemplar]]

**Category** classfeature; 




The litany of heroic deeds left in your wake has caused your divine spark to blaze bright enough that it now illuminates your legacy. Choose one of the following epithets, which grants you an ability you can use when you Spark Transcendence. You can benefit from no more than one epithet ability each time you Spark Transcendence.
