# Tough To Kill
## Feat 3
### [[guardian]]

**Category** classfeature; 




The protectiveness of your armor ensures that even if you fall, you take longer to die. You gain the [[Feats/Diehard|Diehard]] general feat. If you already have the Diehard feat, you can retrain it when you get Tough to Kill. Additionally, the first time each day you'd be reduced to [[Conditions/Dying|Dying]] 3 or higher, you stay at dying 2 instead.
