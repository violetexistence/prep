# Thief
## Feat 1
### [[rogue]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Nothing beats the thrill of taking something that belongs to someone else. You might be a pickpocket working the streets, a cat burglar sneaking through windows, or even a consultant, testing your clients' vaults for openings.

When a fight breaks out, you prefer swift, lightweight weapons, and you strike where it hurts. When you attack with a finesse melee weapon or finesse melee unarmed attack, you can add your Dexterity modifier to damage rolls instead of your Strength modifier.

You are trained in Thievery.
