# Shootist's Edge
## Feat 17
### [[gunslinger]]

**Category** classfeature; 




You make shots others find impossible. Your proficiency rank for your gunslinger class DC increases to master. When using a ranged weapon in which you have master or greater proficiency, you ignore the penalty for attacking within the weapon's second and third range increments.
