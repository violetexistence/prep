# Whisper of Wings
## Feat 1
### [[witch]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Wings and swirling winds announced the approach of your patron. The wings might have been radiantly feathered, jeweled like a dragonfly's, strangely mechanical, or leathery with the scent of sulfur, but the controlled chaos of their movements contained countless teachings.

**Spell List** primal

**Patron Skill** Nature

**Lesson of the Observed Sky** Your patron teaches that the sky can guide you anywhere you let it. You gain the [[Spells/Murmuration|Murmuration]] hex cantrip, and your familiar learns [[Spells/Gentle Landing|Gentle Landing]].

**Familiar of Nimble Flight** Even if your familiar doesn't have wings, it can sometimes move as if carried aloft by the wind. When you Cast or Sustain a hex, your familiar can Fly up to 15 feet; this movement doesn't trigger reactions.
