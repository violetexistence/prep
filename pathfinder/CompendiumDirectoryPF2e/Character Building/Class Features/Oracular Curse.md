# Oracular Curse
## Feat 1
### [[oracle]]

**Category** classfeature; 




As an oracle, you can tap into the pure and unmitigated divine power of creation to supplement your spellcasting via cursebound abilities. These abilities grant you special benefits, but the backlash of letting this power into your mortal body manifests as an oracular curse. The more cursebound abilities you use, the more your curse worsens, but you might gain divine benefits even as it tightens its grip on your soul.

Your oracular curse is expressed using the [[Conditions/Cursebound|Cursebound]] condition, a unique condition that affects only oracles. Immediately after the first time you use a cursebound ability, you become cursebound 1, and if you use a cursebound ability while you are already cursebound, you increase the value of your cursebound condition by 1 after the ability resolves. At lower levels, you can tolerate only a modest amount of divine power, and your cursebound condition can't increase beyond cursebound 2; as you grow in levels, you can open yourself to even more power and your cursebound condition can progress to 3 and finally 4. Once saturated in divine power, your soul can't absorb any more, and so you can't use a cursebound ability if you are already at your maximum cursebound condition.

Your oracular curse lists the specific effects of being cursebound, which are cumulative as your curse progresses. You remain cursebound until you Refocus, which reduces your cursebound condition by 1 in addition to restoring a Focus Point. As your curse is a direct result of divine power, you cannot mitigate, reduce, or remove the effects of your curse or any ability with the cursebound trait by any means other than Refocusing. For example, if a cursebound effect makes creatures [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] from you, you can't negate that concealed condition through a magic item or spell, such as [[Spells/Sure Strike|Sure Strike]] (though you would still benefit from the other effects of that item or spell). Likewise, [[Spells/Cleanse Affliction|Cleanse Affliction]] and similar abilities don't affect your curse at all.

At 1st level, you gain a cursebound oracle feat determined by your [[Class Features/Mystery|Mystery]], and you can learn additional cursebound abilities through oracle feats.

### The Cursebound Condition

Your oracular curse is constricting around you as you receive divine punishment after drawing too deeply on your mystery's powers. Cursebound is a condition that affects only creatures with an oracular curse, and cursebound always includes a value. Your specific oracular curse imposes unique negative effects depending on your cursebound value. You can remove the cursebound condition only by Refocusing.
