# Witness to Ancient Battles
## Feat 1
### [[animist]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Witnesses to ancient battles may be the lingering remnants of soldiers who never returned from their last deployment or the restless souls of warriors whose final contest left them unfulfilled. Or the apparitions may be valkyries and other beings from beyond, naturally drawn to sites of death and battle, or even the unquiet entity formed from a battlefield that saw so much death and blood it gained a spiritual essence of its own. Witnesses to ancient battles are often somber and grim.
