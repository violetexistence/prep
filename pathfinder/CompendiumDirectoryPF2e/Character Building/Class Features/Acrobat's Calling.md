# Acrobat's Calling
## Feat 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[calling]][[mythic]]

**Category** calling; 




You feel a need to dance amid dangerous heights and soar across empty divides with nothing but your skill and reflexes to protect you. When you [[Actions/Balance|Balance]], [[Actions/Maneuver in Flight|Maneuver in Flight]], [[Actions/Tumble Through|Tumble Through]], or attempt a [[Actions/Long Jump|Long Jump]], you can spend a Mythic Point to attempt the check at mythic proficiency. The first time each day that you critically succeed on an Acrobatics check while Balancing, Maneuvering in Flight, or Tumbling Through during combat, you regain a Mythic Point.

* * *

**Edicts** leap without being sure you'll land unharmed, test your reflexes by maneuvering through the spaces of significantly more powerful enemies

**Anathema** maneuver around an enemy when tumbling through their space is a viable option, use safety measures to attempt acrobatic stunts
