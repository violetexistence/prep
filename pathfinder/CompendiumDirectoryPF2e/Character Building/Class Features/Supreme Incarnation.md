# Supreme Incarnation
## Feat 19
### [[animist]]

**Category** classfeature; 




You become a nexus between the mortal and spiritual realms through which your apparition can embody its full might. You gain a 10th-rank apparition spell slot. In addition to heightened versions of your apparition spells, you can use this slot to cast [[Spells/Avatar|Avatar]]. When you cast _avatar_ in this way, you do not become an avatar of a deity; rather, your primary attuned apparition incarnates itself using your body, transforming you into the avatar described in your primary attuned apparition's entry.
