# Spirit Striking
## Feat 7
### [[exemplar]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Your divine power can't be contained, escaping in flits and embers as you wreak violence. You deal 2 additional spirit damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.
