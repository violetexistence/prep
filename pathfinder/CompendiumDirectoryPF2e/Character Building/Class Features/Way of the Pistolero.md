# Way of the Pistolero
## Feat 1
### [[gunslinger]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Whether you're a professional duelist or a pistol-twirling entertainer, you have quick feet and quicker hands that never seem to let you down, and an equally sharp wit and tongue that jab your foes. You might leave a hand free or cultivate the ambidexterity for twin weapons. Either way, you stay close enough to your enemies to leverage your superior reflexes while leaving enough space to safely fire.

**Slinger's Reload** [[Actions/Raconteur's Reload|Raconteur's Reload]]

**Deeds** _Initial_ [[Actions/Ten Paces|Ten Paces]]; _Advanced_ [[Actions/Pistolero's Retort|Pistolero's Retort]]; _Greater_ [[Actions/Grim Swagger|Grim Swagger]]

**Way Skill** choose Deception or Intimidation
