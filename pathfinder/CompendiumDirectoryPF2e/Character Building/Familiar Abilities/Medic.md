# Medic

### 

**Category** familiar; 




Your familiar can draw upon the power of your deity to [[Actions/Cast a Spell|Cast a Spell]] once per day. The familiar can cast the 1-action version of [[Spells/Heal|Heal]] at a level 2 levels lower than your highest-rank spell slot, which it can cast only on you. You must be able to cast 3rd-rank spells from spell slots to select this ability.
