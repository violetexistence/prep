# Vina Song `pf2:2`

### [[auditory]][[concentrate]][[divine]][[incapacitation]][[mental]]

**Category** familiar; 




**Frequency** once per hour, see below

* * *

**Effect** Your kinnari elegantly plays her instrument. Each creature within a 30-foot emanation must attempt a Will save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher, or be [[Conditions/Fascinated|Fascinated]] for 1 round. A kinnar can use this ability again on the next round to continue the song and force affected creatures to attempt another Will save; on a failure, a creature is fascinated for an additional round. Once the kinnar stops playing, they can't use this ability again for 1 hour. A creature that succeeds at any save or has its fascination broken is temporarily immune to that kinnar's Vina Song for 24 hours. Kinnars are immune to this ability.
