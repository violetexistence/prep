# Radiant

### 

**Category** familiar; 




Your familiar is filled with a divine radiance that makes it resistant to the forces of evil. Your familiar gains resistance to evil and void damage equal to half your level.

_Note: As effects placed on one actor cannot reference data from another actor, the resistance of half the PC level is not automatable. Please update the familiars resistances accordingly._
