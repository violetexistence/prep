# Familiar of Freezing Rime

### 

**Category** familiar; 




Your familiar is cold to the touch, its breath always visible. When you Cast or Sustain a hex, you can cause ice to form in a 5-foot burst centered on a square of your familiar's space. Those squares are difficult terrain until the start of your next turn.
