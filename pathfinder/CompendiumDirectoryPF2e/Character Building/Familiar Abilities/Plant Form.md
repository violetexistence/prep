# Plant Form

### 

**Category** familiar; 




Your plant familiar can change shape as a single action, transforming into a Tiny plant of a type roughly similar to the familiar's nature. This otherwise uses the effects of [[Spells/One with Plants|One with Plants]]. You must have a familiar with the plant trait to select this ability.
