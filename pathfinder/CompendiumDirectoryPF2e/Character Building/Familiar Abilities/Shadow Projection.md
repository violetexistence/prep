# Shadow Projection `pf2:1`

### [[shadow]]

**Category** familiar; 




Your makhluk wayang projects its shadow into a larger silhouette of itself, allowing it to grasp things outside of its obvious reach. It increases its reach to 10 feet for the purposes of taking non-hostile Interact actions until the end of your turn.
