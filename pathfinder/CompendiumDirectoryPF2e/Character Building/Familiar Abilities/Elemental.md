# Elemental

### 

**Category** familiar; 




Your familiar has the elemental trait instead of the animal trait. Choose air, earth, fire, metal, water, or wood. Your familiar gains that trait. The familiar is immune to bleed, [[Conditions/Paralyzed|Paralyzed]], poison, sleep, and the element matching its trait. Your familiar must have the resistance familiar ability to select this.
