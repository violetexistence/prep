# Elemental Familiar (Air)

### [[air]]

**Category** familiar; 




Your familiar gains the air elemental trait.

If your familiar stays completely still for 1 round, it becomes [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]] until it next takes an action. Any motion, even being moved or carried by another creature, ends this effect.
