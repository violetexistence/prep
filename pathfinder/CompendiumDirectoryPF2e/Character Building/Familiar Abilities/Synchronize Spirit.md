# Synchronize Spirit `pf2:1`

### 

**Category** familiar; 




You can synchronize your spiritual energy with that of your familiar to temporarily become part spirit yourself. Once per round, you can Sustain to synchronize your spirit with that of your familiar. You remain synchronized with your spirit until the beginning of your next turn. While synchronized, whenever you Strike or Cast a Spell without a duration that deals damage, you deal spirit damage instead of your normal damage.
