# Verdant Burst

### 

**Category** familiar; 




**Prerequisites** [[Feats/Leshy Familiar Secrets|Leshy Familiar Secrets]]

When your familiar dies, it releases its primal energy to cast the 3-action version of [[Spells/Heal|Heal]], heightened to a rank 1 lower than your highest-rank spell slot. The _heal_ spell gains a status bonus equal to twice the spell's rank to the Hit Points it restores to plants. You must be able to cast 2nd-rank spells using spell slots to select this familiar ability.
