# Familiar of Obscuring Snowfall

### 

**Category** familiar; 




Your familiar is always covered in a thin layer of snow, which it sheds as needed. When you Cast or Sustain a hex, you can cause clinging snow to fall in a 5-foot burst centered on a square of your familiar's space. This snowfall remains until the start of your next turn, and enemies that enter these squares during that period are [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] until the start of your next turn.

* * *

_PFS Note:_ For this ability, choose a corner of the familiar's square for the center of the burst.
