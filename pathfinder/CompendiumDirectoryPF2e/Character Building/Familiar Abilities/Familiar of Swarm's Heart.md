# Familiar of Swarm's Heart

### 

**Category** familiar; 




Your familiar is surrounded by a cloud of harmless insects. When you Cast or Sustain a hex, the insects swarm to protect you and your allies. Until the start of your next turn, your familiar grants concealment to you or any ally while sharing the same space.
