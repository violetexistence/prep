# Play Dead

### 

**Category** familiar; 




Your familiar pretends to be inanimate, hiding its supernatural capabilities. It can Hide without any cover or concealment from creatures that don't realize it's alive, so long as it's in a location where it wouldn't seem out of place. If the familiar succeeds, onlookers still see it, but they mistake it for an inanimate object. After being fooled once, they realize your familiar is alive, and it can't Hide from them in that way again.
