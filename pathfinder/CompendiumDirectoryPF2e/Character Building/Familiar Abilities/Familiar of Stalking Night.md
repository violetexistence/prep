# Familiar of Stalking Night

### 

**Category** familiar; 




Your familiar is dark of fur or feather, and light seems to disappear into it. When you Cast or Sustain a hex, and your familiar is adjacent to an enemy to which it's [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]], [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]], or undetected, the enemy becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]].
