# Seal-Bearer

### 

**Category** familiar; 




During your daily preparations, you can inscribe a symbol or seal upon your shikigami that corresponds to the air, earth, fire, metal, water, or wood element. If you use the shikigami's kindling ability that day, it applies to a spell that deals damage with the relevant trait to the chosen element, instead of only the fire trait.
