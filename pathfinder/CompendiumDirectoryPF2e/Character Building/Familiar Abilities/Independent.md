# Independent

### 

**Category** familiar; 




In an encounter, if you don't Command your familiar, it still gains 1 action each round. Typically, you still decide how it spends that action, but, the GM might determine that your familiar chooses its own tactics rather than performing your preferred action. This doesn't work with [[Familiar Abilities/Valet|Valet]] or similar abilities that require a command, if you're capable of riding your familiar, or similar situations.
