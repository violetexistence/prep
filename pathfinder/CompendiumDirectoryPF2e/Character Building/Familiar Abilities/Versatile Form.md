# Versatile Form

### 

**Category** familiar; 




The crafted body of your familiar allows you to make adjustments to it when required. Once per day, you can spend 10 minutes to change one familiar or master ability your familiar possesses. To select this ability, your familiar must be a construct, and you must be at least trained in Crafting.
