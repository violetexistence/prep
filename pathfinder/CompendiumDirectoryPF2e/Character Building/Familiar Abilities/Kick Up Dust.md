# Kick Up Dust `pf2:2`

### [[manipulate]]

**Category** familiar; 




**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

**Effect** Your dust bunny shakes and kicks to stir up dust in a 5-foot emanation. Each creature in the area must attempt a Fortitude save against the higher of your class DC or spell DC. A creature that fails its save begins sneezing uncontrollably and is [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] and cannot take reactions for 1 round; on a critical failure they are [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 2]].
