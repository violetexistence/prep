**Category** familiar; 




**Requirements** You Cast a Spell that had the air or electricity traits this turn;

* * *

**Effect** Your familiar absorbs excess electrical charge and unleashes a 5-foot emanation of static electricity that flows into creatures' meridians. Creatures in the emanation that fail a `Fortitude check` save against your spell DC become [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] until the end of their next turn. If a creature is soaked or standing over or in water inside the emanation, it also takes 1d4 persistent electricity damage on a failed save.
