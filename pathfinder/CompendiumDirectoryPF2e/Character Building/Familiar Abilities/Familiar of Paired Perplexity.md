# Familiar of Paired Perplexity

### 

**Category** familiar; 




Your familiar has twice as many of a small feature than a normal creature would have, such a second tail or an extra pair of whiskers. When you Cast or Sustain a hex, your familiar seems to double and be in two places at once. One creature you choose within 20 feet of it is [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] until the start of your next turn; this is a visual effect.
