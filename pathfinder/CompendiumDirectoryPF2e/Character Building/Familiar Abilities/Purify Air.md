# Purify Air

### 

**Category** familiar; 




**Prerequisites** [[Feats/Leshy Familiar Secrets|Leshy Familiar Secrets]]

Your familiar recycles air, providing enough oxygen for a Medium creature in areas with stale air, such as a sealed chamber or extradimensional space. If the leshy is within the area of an inhaled poison effect or an effect that relies on smell, creatures within a 15-foot emanation from the leshy gain a +2 circumstance bonus to their saving throws against the effect.
