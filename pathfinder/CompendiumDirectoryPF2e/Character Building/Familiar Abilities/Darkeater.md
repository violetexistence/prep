# Darkeater

### 

**Category** familiar; 




Your familiar naturally recovers in the shadows. After spending 10 consecutive minutes in an area of dim light or darkness, your familiar recovers a number of Hit Points equal to half your level.

This ability is for a shadow familiar. A shadowcaster, however, can select this ability for any kind of familiar.
