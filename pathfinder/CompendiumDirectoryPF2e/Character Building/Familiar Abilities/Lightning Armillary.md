# Lightning Armillary `pf2:1`

### [[electricity]]

**Category** familiar; 




**Effect** Your familiar flies around and around an adjacent ally's weapon or hand, dissolving into multiple rings of lightning. Until the beginning of your next turn, the affected weapon or unarmed attack deals an additional 1d6 electricity damage, or 1d8 electricity damage if you Cast a Spell with the air or electricity trait this turn. Your familiar remains in lightning ring form, preventing it from being targeted or taking any actions.
