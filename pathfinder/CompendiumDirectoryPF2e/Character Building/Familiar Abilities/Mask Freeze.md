# Mask Freeze

### 

**Category** familiar; 




When in mask form, your familiar can hide its obvious supernatural qualities to pass as a simple, unassuming mask. It doesn't need to Impersonate to fool a passing glance, and it gains a +4 circumstance bonus to its Deception DC against an active observer Seeking or otherwise studying it.
