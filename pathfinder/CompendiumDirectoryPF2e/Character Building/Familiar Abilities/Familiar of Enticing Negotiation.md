# Familiar of Enticing Negotiation

### 

**Category** familiar; 




Your familiar constantly whispers distracting offers of power, wealth, and other temptations to your enemies, even if your familiar normally doesn't have the means of speaking. When you Cast or Sustain a hex and your familiar is within 10 feet of an enemy, the enemy becomes [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the start of your next turn. Your familiar can only distract a single enemy per round in this way.
