# Absorb Familiar

### 

**Category** familiar; 




Your familiar can transform into a mark you carry on your flesh, typically seeming like a birthmark, tattoo, or gem that vaguely resembles its normal form. When transformed, the familiar can't act except to turn back into a familiar. It isn't affected by area effects and must be targeted separately to affect it, which requires knowledge that it's a creature.

This means you and your allies can heal or assist the familiar while most enemies stay unaware of its true nature. Creatures must attempt a `DC 20 Perception check` check to [[Actions/Seek|Seek]] to realize a it is actually a familiar. Your familiar can still communicate its feelings empathically. Transforming the familiar between forms is a 1-minute activity that has the concentrate trait.
