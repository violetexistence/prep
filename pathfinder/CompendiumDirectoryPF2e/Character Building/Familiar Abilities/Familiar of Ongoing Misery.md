# Familiar of Ongoing Misery

### 

**Category** familiar; 




Your familiar seems hostile to all creatures other than you, hissing at them if they get too near. When you Cast or Sustain a hex, your familiar can curse a creature within 15 feet of it, prolonging the duration of any negative conditions affecting it by 1 round. This is a curse effect. This prolongs only conditions with a timed duration (such as "1 round" or "until the end of your next turn") and doesn't prevent conditions from being removed by other means.
