# Item Delivery

### 

**Category** familiar; 




If your familiar is adjacent to you, you can Command it to deliver an item. Instead of its normal 2 actions, your familiar Interacts to take an item you're holding of light Bulk or less, then takes one move action, then finally Interacts to pass off the item to another willing creature.

It can instead administer the item to the creature if it can do so with 1 action and has an appropriate type of item (such as alchemical elixir). If your familiar doesn't reach the target this turn, it holds the item until commanded otherwise. Your familiar must have the manual dexterity ability to select this.
