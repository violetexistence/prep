# Kindling

### 

**Category** familiar; 




You can immolate your familiar's body for a surge of power. Once per day as a free action, when you Cast a Spell that has the fire trait, deals damage, and doesn't have a duration, you can sacrifice your familiar to empower the spell. Your familiar is immediately slain, and you gain a status bonus to that spell's damage equal to twice the spell rank.
