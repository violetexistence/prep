# Familiar of Insightful Observation

### 

**Category** familiar; 




Your familiar boasts a third eye upon their head or body, resembling the one set in Cobyslarni's forehead. When you Cast or Sustain a hex, your familiar can attempt a check to Recall Knowledge as a free action with any skill in which you are trained or better, using your bonus, and psychically transmit the information to you.
