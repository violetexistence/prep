# Familiar of Parasitic Might

### 

**Category** familiar; 




Your familiar appears gaunt and malnourished or otherwise on the brink of death, even though it's quite healthy. When you Cast or Sustain a hex, your familiar can draw on the waning strength of another to sustain itself. One creature within 15 feet of your familiar with less than half of its maximum Hit Points becomes [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] unless it succeeds at a `Fortitude check` saving throw against your spell DC.
