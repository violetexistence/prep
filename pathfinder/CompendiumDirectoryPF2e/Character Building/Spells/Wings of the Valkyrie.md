    desc: "Powerful feathered wings—usually vibrant white or jet black—emerge from your back, granting you a fly Speed equal to your Speed. You can use these wings to attempt to [[Actions/Shove|Shove]] a creature; you don't need a free hand to do so, and you can roll using your spell attack modifier instead of your Athletics skill for the check. When this spell's duration ends, if you're still flying, you float to the ground, as [[Spells/Gentle Landing|Gentle Landing]].\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Wings of the Valkyrie|Spell Effect: Wings of the Valkyrie]]\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (5th)** The duration increases to 1 minute.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Wings of the Valkyrie (Heightened)|Spell Effect: Wings of the Valkyrie (Heightened)]]"
