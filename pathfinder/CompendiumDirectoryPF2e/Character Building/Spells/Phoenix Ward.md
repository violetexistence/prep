    desc: "You raise a fiery shield around yourself, gaining resistance 10 to fire. If you take fire damage that would reduce you to 0 Hit Points, the _phoenix ward_ absorbs any damage beyond the amount that would bring you to 1 Hit Point. The ward then heals you in a brilliant display of flames in the shape of a phoenix's wings and envelop you in light. You regain Hit Points equal to 4d8 + the absorbed damage; this is a healing vitality effect. The _phoenix ward_ then ends, and you can't cast it again for 24 hours.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The healing increases by 1d8.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Phoenix Ward|Spell Effect: Phoenix Ward]]"
