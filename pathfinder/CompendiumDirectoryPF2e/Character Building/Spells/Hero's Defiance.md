    desc: "**Trigger** An attack would bring you to 0 Hit Points.\n* * *\n\nYou shout in defiance and are filled with a burst of healing. Just before applying the attack's damage, you recover 6d8+20 Hit Points. If this is enough to prevent the attack from bringing you to 0 Hit Points, you don't become [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]] or [[Conditions/Dying|Dying]]. Either way, cheating death is difficult, and you can't use _hero's defiance_ again until you Refocus or make your daily preparations. _Hero's defiance_ can't be used against effects with the death trait or that would leave no remains, such as disintegrate."
