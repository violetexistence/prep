    desc: "**Trigger** You or a creature within range attempts a saving throw against an obvious threat.\n* * *\n\nYou prophesize the result of the triggering saving throw as either a success (including a critical success) or a failure (including a critical failure). The target gains a +1 status bonus to the save if you predict success or a –1 status penalty if you predict failure. If you predict the result correctly, fortune favors you, and you gain a +1 status bonus to saving throws. If you predict incorrectly, fortune spurns the target, imparting a –1 status penalty to its saving throws.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (6th)** The save bonus or penalty increases to +2 or –2.\n\n**Heightened (9th)** The save bonus or penalty increases to +3 or –3."
