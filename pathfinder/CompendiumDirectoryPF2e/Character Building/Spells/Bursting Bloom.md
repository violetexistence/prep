    desc: "You cause a rose bush to sprout from the chest of a foe, bursting out of its body and wrapping it in thorned vines. The target takes 6d6 piercing damage and 1d6 persistent bleed damage and must attempt a Fortitude save. When the target is no longer taking persistent bleed damage and is no longer encumbered, the rose bush withers away to nothing.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature takes half damage and no persistent damage.\n\n**Failure** The creature takes full damage and persistent damage and is [[Conditions/Encumbered|Encumbered]] for 4 rounds.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and persistent damage and is encumbered for 1 minute.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+2)** The initial damage increases by 3d6, and the persistent bleed damage increases by 1d6."
