    desc: "Harnessing your mastery of transformative magic, you hide forms within forms. You transform yourself into any form you could choose with a polymorph spell in your spell repertoire or that you could prepare of 8th-rank or lower (including any 8th-rank or lower heightened versions of spells you know). You gain 40 temporary Hit Points rather than the amount normally granted by the form.\n\nYou can Sustain the spell to enter a new form you haven't used during this _metamorphosis_. This replenishes your temporary Hit Points from this spell."
