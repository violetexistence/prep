    desc: "You speak about the consequences of actions people take against each other and how it's possible to break cycles of violence simply by making a different choice. The targets regain 1d4 Hit Points at the end of their own turns while the spell is in effect. If a target uses a hostile action against the other target, the spell ends for the target that used the hostile action.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The targets regain an additional 1d4 Hit Points at the end of their own turns."
