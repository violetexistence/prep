    desc: "A spray of rainbow light beams cascades from your open hand. Each creature in the area must roll 1d8 on the table below to see which beam affects it, then attempt a saving throw of the indicated type. The table notes any additional traits that apply to each type of ray. If a creature is struck by multiple beams, it uses the same d20 result for all its saving throws. For all rays, a successful saving throw negates the effect for that creature.\n\n### **Prismatic Spray**\n\n  \n\n| 1d8 | Color | Save | Effects (Traits) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Red | Reflex | 50 fire damage (fire) |\n| 2 | Orange | Reflex | 60 acid damage (acid) |\n| 3 | Yellow | Reflex | 70 electricity damage (electricity) |\n| 4 | Green | Fortitude | 30 poison damage and [[Conditions/Enfeebled\\|Enfeebled 1]] for 1 minute (poison) |\n| 5 | Blue | Fortitude | Affected as if by [[Spells/Petrify\\|Petrify]] |\n| 6 | Indigo | Will | [[Conditions/Confused\\|Confused]], as the [[Spells/Warp Mind\\|Warp Mind]] spell (mental) |\n| 7 | Violet | Will | [[Conditions/Slowed\\|Slowed]] for 1 minute; if a critical failure, sent to another plane, as [[Spells/Interplanar Teleport\\|Interplanar Teleport]] (teleportation) |\n| 8 | Potent beam | - | Affected by two beams - roll twice, rerolling any duplicates or results of 8 |"
