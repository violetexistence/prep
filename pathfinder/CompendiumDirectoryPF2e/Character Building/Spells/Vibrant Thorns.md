    desc: "Your body sprouts a coat of brambly thorns that thrive on life magic. Adjacent creatures that hit you with a melee attack, as well as creatures that hit you with unarmed attacks, take 1 piercing damage each time they do. Anytime you cast a vitality spell, the thorns' damage increases to 1d6 piercing until the start of your next turn.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1, or 1d6 after you cast a vitality spell."
