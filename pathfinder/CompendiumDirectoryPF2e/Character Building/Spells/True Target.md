    desc: "You delve into the possible futures of the next few seconds to understand all the ways your foe might avoid harm, then cast out a vision of that future to those around you. Designate a creature. The first time each target makes an attack roll against that creature during _true target_'s duration, the attacker rolls twice and uses the better result. The attacker also ignores circumstance penalties to the attack roll and any flat check required due to the designated creature being [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] or [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]].\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ True Target|Spell Effect: True Target]]"
