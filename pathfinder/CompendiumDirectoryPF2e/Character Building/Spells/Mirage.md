This doesn't disguise any structures or creatures in the area.\n\nAny creature that touches the illusion or uses the [[Actions/Seek|Seek]] action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (5th)** Your image can also disguise structures or create illusory structures (but still doesn't disguise creatures)."
