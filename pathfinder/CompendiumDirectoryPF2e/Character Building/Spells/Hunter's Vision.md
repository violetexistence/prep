    desc: "Your target glows with a magical aura visible only to you and those who follow your lead. Your target is visible to you and others sharing your [[Class Features/Hunt Prey|Hunt Prey]] benefits even if it wouldn't normally be due to lighting or the [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] or [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]] conditions, though cover from opaque objects still blocks your sight. You ignore the flat check against the target due to the Concealed condition, and the target isn't automatically [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] from you due to darkness or being Invisible."
