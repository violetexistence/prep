    desc: "You call forth a servitor forged from raw vitality energy to heal and bolster your allies. The servitor occupies the space of a Huge creature and has a speed of 60 feet.\n\n**Arrive** (healing, necromancy, vitality) _Servitor's Protection_ The servitor appears in a flash of light, moving from ally to ally and granting them a temporary reprieve. All allies within 20 feet of the Servitor gain 20 temporary Hit Points until the servitor departs.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Summon Healing Servitor|Spell Effect: Summon Healing Servitor]]\n\n**Depart** (healing, necromancy, vitality) _Servitor's Blessing_ The servitor disappears in a 30-foot emanation of vitality energy. All willing living creatures within heal 3d8 Hit Points. All undead within take that much damage, with a basic Fortitude save.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+2)** The Arrive effect's temporary Hit Points increase by 8, and the Depart effect's healing and damage to undead increase by 1d8."
