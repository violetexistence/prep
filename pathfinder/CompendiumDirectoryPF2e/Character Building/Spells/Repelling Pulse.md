Each creature in the area takes 7d10 force damage depending on its Reflex save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature takes half damage.\n\n**Failure** The creature takes full damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage. The creature is pushed 20 feet away from you and is then knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]].\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+2)** The force damage increases by 2d10, and the distance the target is moved on a failure and critical failure increases by 5 feet."
