    desc: "You utter a potent litany from your faith, a mandate that harms those who oppose your ideals. You deal 7d10 spirit damage to your enemies in the area; each enemy must attempt a Fortitude save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature takes half damage.\n\n**Failure** The creature takes full damage and is [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 2]] for 1 minute.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and is enfeebled 2 for 1 minute. If you're on your home plane and the creature is not, the creature is sent back to its home plane. A creature of 10th level or lower must also succeed at a Will save or be [[Conditions/Paralyzed|Paralyzed]] for 1 minute; if it critically fails, it dies (this is a death effect).\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d10, and the level of creatures that must attempt a second save on a critical failure increases by 2."
