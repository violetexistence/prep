    desc: "You tap into Corazal's innumerable senses to identify disturbances throughout the Verduran Forest.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** You and Corazal successfully identify a flashpoint: an imminent event that could stoke distrust and unrest. You experience a sensory premonition of the event, can cast know the way as a 7th-rank cantrip to point toward the location, and know which Elder Oak is closest to it.\n\n**Success** As success, but the ritual heavily taxes your mind and body. You are [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]], and until the drained condition ends, you are also [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]].\n\n**Failure** The ritual has no effect.\n\n**Critical Failure** The ritual has no effect beyond burning your mind with conflicting information. You are [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 2]], and until the drained condition ends, you are also stupefied 1 and have the Dubious Knowledge skill feat. Whenever you would decrease this drained value, the value does not decrease unless you succeed at a `DC 11 Flat check`."
