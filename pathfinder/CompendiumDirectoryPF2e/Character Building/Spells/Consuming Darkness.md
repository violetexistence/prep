    desc: "Your shadow wriggles before spreading out from you, forming a gateway of clinging, consuming shadow through which the horrors of another plane can barely be seen. The first time each turn you [[Actions/Sustain|Sustain the Spell]], the radius increases by 5 feet. Each enemy that enters the area or begins its turn in the area takes 2d6 void damage and must attempt a Reflex save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature sinks partially into the shadow, taking half damage and a -5-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds for as long it remains in the area.\n\n**Failure** As success, but the creature takes full damage and a 10-foot circumstance penalty.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature is absorbed into the shadows, where it can be seen below the surface; it takes double damage and is [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] for 1 round or until it [[Actions/Escape|Escapes]].\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d6 void."
