    desc: "You create a pattern of lights that pulses with intensity. Creatures are [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] while inside the pattern. In addition, a creature must attempt a Will saving throw if it's inside the pattern when you cast it, enters the pattern, ends its turn within the pattern, or uses a Seek or Interact action on the pattern. A creature currently [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] by the pattern doesn't need to attempt new saving throws.\n* * *\n\n**Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Failure** The creature is Blinded by the pattern. If it exits the pattern, it can attempt a new save to recover from the Blinded condition at the end of each of its turns, to a maximum duration of 1 minute.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature is Blinded for 1 minute."
