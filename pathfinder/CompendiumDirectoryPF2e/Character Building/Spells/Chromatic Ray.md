    desc: "You send out a ray of colored light streaming toward your enemy, with a magical effect depending on the ray's color. Make a spell attack roll. If you hit, roll 1d4 to see which beam you cast. If the ray deals damage, that damage is doubled on a critical hit. Any additional traits that apply to a ray are listed in parentheses just after the name of the color.\n\n1.  **Red** (fire) The ray deals 30 fire damage to the target.\n2.  **Orange** (acid) The ray deals 40 acid damage to the target.\n3.  **Yellow** (electricity) The ray deals 50 electricity damage to the target.\n4.  **Green** (poison) The ray deals 25 poison damage to the target, and the target must succeed at a Fortitude save or be [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]] for 1 minute ([[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 2]] on a critical failure).\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (6th)** The damage for Red, Orange, Yellow, and Green each increase by 10. Roll 1d8 to determine the ray's color, using the results for 1-4 above and the results for 5-8 below.\n\n5.  **Blue** The ray has the effect of the [[Spells/Petrify|Petrify]] spell. On a critical hit, the target is [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] as long as it's [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed]] by the _flesh to stone_ effect.\n6.  **Indigo** (emotion, incapacitation, mental) The ray has the effect of the [[Spells/Confusion|Confusion]] spell. On a critical hit, it has the effect of [[Spells/Warp Mind|Warp Mind]] instead.\n7.  **Violet** The target is [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed]] for 1 minute. It must also succeed at a will save or be teleported 120 feet directly away from you (if there isn't room for it to appear there, it appears in the nearest open space); this is a teleportation effect.\n8.  **Intense Color** The target is [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] until the end of your next turn, or [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] if your attack roll was a critical hit. Roll again and add the effects of another color (rerolling results of 8)."
