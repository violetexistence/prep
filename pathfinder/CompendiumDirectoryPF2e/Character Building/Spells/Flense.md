    desc: "With a touch, you strip off the flesh, muscle, and internal organs off your target, leaving only bare bones. The effect depends on whether the target is a living creature, undead creature, or inanimate corpse. A creature or corpse that lacks flesh, muscle, and internal organs is immune to this spell.\n\n**Inanimate Corpse** The flesh, muscle, viscera, and organs are stripped from the corpse and vanish, leaving only bare bones behind.\n\n**Living Creature** Make a spell attack roll. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 slashing damage. On a critical hit, double the damage, and the target also takes 1d4 persistent bleed damage. If this spell's damage kills the target, the corpse is only bones.\n\n**Undead Creature** Make a spell attack roll. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 slashing damage. On a critical hit, double the damage, and the target also becomes [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]] for 1 minute. If this spell's damage destroys the target, only its bare bones remain behind.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The slashing damage to living and undead creatures increases by 2d6, and the persistent bleed damage to living creatures increases by 1d4."
