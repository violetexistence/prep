    desc: "With a quick series of wrist flicks, music fills the air. While the music can be heard as if it were performed normally at a distance, creatures in the spell's area become affected in more significant ways. When you cast musical shift, select a key signature (to affect enemies) and a time signature (to affect allies) from the options below; all creatures within the area are affected as indicated. You can change the key signature or time signature as part of the action you take when you Sustain the spell.\n\n**Flat** (key signature) Whenever an enemy critically fails at a Strike, saving throw, or skill check, they fall [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] in addition to other effects from the critical failure.\n\n**Natural** (key signature) Enemies take a â€“2 status penalty to attack rolls.\n\n**Sharp** (key signature) Whenever an enemy takes piercing or slashing damage, they also take 2d6 persistent bleed damage.\n\n**Double** (time signature) You and your allies become [[Conditions/Quickened|Quickened]] and can use the extra action each round only for [[Actions/Leap|Leap]], Stand, Step, or Stride actions.\n\n**Quadruple** (time signature) You and your allies gain a +2 status bonus to attack rolls.\n\n**Triple** (time signature) You and your allies gain a +2 status bonus to Armor Class and Reflex saving throws.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Musical Shift|Spell Effect: Musical Shift]]"
