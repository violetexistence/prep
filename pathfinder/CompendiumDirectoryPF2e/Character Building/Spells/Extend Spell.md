    desc: "You call upon your blood's knowledge of the ancients to extend your magic. If your next action is to Cast a Spell with a duration of 1 minute on a single target, the spell instead lasts 10 minutes. You can extend a spell only if you cast it from a spell slot lower than your highest spell slot, and you can have only one active spell at a time extended in this way."
