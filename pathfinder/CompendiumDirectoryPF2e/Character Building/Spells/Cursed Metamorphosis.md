    desc: "You transform the target creature into a harmless animal appropriate to the area, with effects based on its Fortitude save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The target's body gains minor features of the harmless animal. Its insides churn as they partially transform, causing it to be [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]]. When it recovers from the sickened condition, its features revert to normal.\n\n**Failure** The target transforms for 1 minute but keeps its mind. If it spends all its actions on its turn concentrating on its original form, it can attempt a `Will check` save to end the effect immediately.\n\n**Critical Failure** The target is transformed into the chosen harmless animal, body and mind, for an unlimited duration."
