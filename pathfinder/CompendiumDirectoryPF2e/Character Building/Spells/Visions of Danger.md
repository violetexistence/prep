    desc: "An illusion of horrific creatures fills the spell's area. The creatures look like Tiny swarming monsters with a specific appearance of your choice, such as fiendish flies or animated saw blades. The burst deals 8d8 mental damage with a basic Will save to each creature that's inside the burst when it's created, enters the burst, or starts its turn inside the burst. A creature that critically succeeds at its Will save can immediately attempt to disbelieve the illusion. A creature that tries to Interact with the monsters or observes one with a [[Actions/Seek|Seek]] action can attempt to disbelieve the illusion. Creatures that disbelieve the illusion take no damage from the illusion thereafter.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The mental damage increases by 1d8"
