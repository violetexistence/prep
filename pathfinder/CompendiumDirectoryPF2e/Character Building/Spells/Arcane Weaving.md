    desc: "You and the secondary casters weave together spells (and, if anadis, silk) in a complex ritual that combines magical learning with art, allowing all the participants to share spells they know with one another.\n* * *\n\n**Success** You or any secondary caster can swap any spell in your spell repertoire for a spell in the spell repertoire of any other participant. This spell can't be a higher level than the ritual's level.\n\n**Failure** None of the participants can swap spells.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, and all participants are [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] for 24 hours and can't reduce their stupefied condition below 1 for 24 hours."
