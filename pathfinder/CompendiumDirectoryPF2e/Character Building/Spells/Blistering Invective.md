    desc: "A heap of insults and invectives spew from your mouth-words so devastating your foes burn from the intensity of your diatribe. Your words deal 2d6 persistent fire damage, and the target must attempt a Will save. If the target doesn't understand the language or you're not speaking a language, it gains a +4 circumstance bonus to its save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The target takes half the persistent fire damage.\n\n**Failure** The target becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]] and takes the full persistent fire damage.\n\n**Critical Failure** The target becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] and takes double the persistent fire damage.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+2)** You can target two additional creatures, and the persistent damage increases by 2d6."
