    desc: "**Area** all squares in two 10-foot bursts.\n* * *\n\nYou create two puddles of acidic slime that hinders the movement of anyone who walks through them. The area of each pool becomes greater difficult terrain. Each round that a creature starts its turn in one of the pools or enters a pool during a move action it's using, it takes 8d6 acid damage with a basic Reflex save. A creature that critically fails its saving throw also takes 1d6 acid persistent. As normal, if a Large or larger creature starts its turn in both pools, it takes the damage only once.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+2)** Create an additional 10-foot burst."
