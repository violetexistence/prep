    desc: "**Trigger** You or an ally in range is targeted by a ranged attack.\n* * *\n\nA cloud of mist enshrouds the target, appearing much like the deflecting clouds created by cloud dragons. The target is treated as [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] for the purposes of resolving the triggering attack (so normally the attacker must succeed at a `DC 11 Flat check` to target it) and all ranged attacks against it for the duration."
