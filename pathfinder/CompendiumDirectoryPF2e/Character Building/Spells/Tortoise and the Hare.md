    desc: "You prove that slow and steady doesn't always win the race by turning a foe into a proverbial tortoise and yourself or an ally into a hare, siphoning some of the foe's speed and granting it to the other target. The effects depend on the foe's Fortitude save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The targets are unaffected.\n\n**Success** The foe is [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] for 1 round, and the other target is unaffected.\n\n**Failure** The foe is slowed 1 for 3 rounds and the other target is [[Conditions/Quickened|Quickened]] for 1 round. It can use the extra action to Step, Stride, or Strike.\n\n**Critical Failure** The foe is slowed 1 for 3 minutes and the other target is quickened for 1 minute. It can use the extra action to Step, Stride, or Strike."
