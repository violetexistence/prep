    desc: "You bombard a target with distracting auditory illusions, surrounding them with a tumultuous cacophony of overlapping speech, whispers, screams, and muttering. The target is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]], takes a -2 status penalty to purely auditory Perception checks, and must succeed at a `DC 5 Flat check` to use auditory abilities or verbal spell components. Similarly, a creature who attempts to affect the target with an auditory effect must succeed at a `DC 5 Flat check` or the attempt fails. The duration depends on the target's Will save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The duration is 1 round.\n\n**Failure** The duration is 3 rounds.\n\n**Critical Failure** The duration is 1 minute.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (7th)** You can target up to five creatures."
