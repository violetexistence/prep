    desc: "Your symphony lifts listeners from their worldly concerns. Attempt a Performance check to counteract an effect applying one of the following conditions to the target: [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]], [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]], [[Conditions/Paralyzed|Paralyzed]], [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]], [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed]], or [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned]]. If you fail, you can't target the same effect on the target for 1 day. Use the condition's source to determine the counteract DC (for example, the [[Actions/Escape|Escape]] DC for grabbed).\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (9th)** You can target up to four creatures."
