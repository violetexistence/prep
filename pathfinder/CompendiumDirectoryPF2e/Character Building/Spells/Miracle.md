    desc: "You request aid directly from your divine source. Your divine source always refuses a request out of line with its nature, and it might grant a different request (potentially more powerful or better fitting its nature) than the one you asked for. A casting of _miracle_ can do any of the following things.\n\n*   Duplicate any spell from the divine list of 9th rank or lower to which you have access.\n*   Duplicate any spell from another spell list of 7th rank or lower. It must be common or you must have access.\n*   Produce any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects.\n*   Reverse certain effects that refer to the [[Spells/Wish|Wish]] spell.\n\nThe GM might allow you to try using _miracle_ to produce greater effects than these, but doing so may be dangerous, or the spell may have only a partial effect."
