The target gains a +1 status bonus to saving throws against emotion and fear.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Guided Introspection|Spell Effect: Guided Introspection]]\n\nIf the target would become [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]] during the spell's duration, they reduce the duration of the confused condition by 1 round, to a minimum of 1 round. If the target would become [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened]] or [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied]], they reduce the value of the frightened or stupefied condition by 1, to a minimum of 1. Once any of these conditions occur, the spell ends.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (4th)** The status bonus increases to +2."
