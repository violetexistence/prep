    desc: "Your words bless a creature with an enhanced connection to vital energy. When the target regains Hit Points from a healing vitality spell, it regains 2 additional Hit Points.\n\nThe target regains additional Hit Points from _healer's blessing_ only the first time it regains HP from a given healing spell, so a spell that heals the creature repeatedly over a duration would restore additional Hit Points only once, when they are first healed.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Healer's Blessing|Spell Effect: Healer's Blessing]]\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The additional healing increases by 2 HP."
