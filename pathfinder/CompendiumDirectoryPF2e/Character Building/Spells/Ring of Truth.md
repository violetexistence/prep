    desc: "You designate an area in which lies are revealed. Creatures in the area also take a â€“2 status penalty to Deception checks. Each time a creature in the area speaks a true statement, the soft ring of a bell sounds in the area. Creatures are aware of the magic; therefore, they can avoid answering questions to which they would normally respond with a lie, or they can be evasive as long as they remain within the boundaries of the truth. If a creature is in the area when the spell is cast or later enters the area, that creature attempts a Will save. It uses the results of this initial save if it leaves and reenters the area.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is so convincing that the bell rings even if they lie.\n\n**Success** If the target lies and succeeds at their Deception check against all targets, the bell still rings.\n\n**Failure** The bell accurately sees through their deception and will never ring if they lie."
