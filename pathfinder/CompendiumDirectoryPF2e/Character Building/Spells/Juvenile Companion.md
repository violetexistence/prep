    desc: "You transform your companion into its juvenile form, such as a cub, foal, kitten, puppy, or piglet, making the target appear harmless. It becomes Tiny (if it was larger), and its reach is reduced to 0 feet. All of its Speeds are halved (to a minimum Speed of 5 feet), and it gains weakness 5 to physical damage. In all other ways, its abilities and statistics are unchanged.\n\nIf your companion uses a hostile action, _juvenile companion_ ends. This spell has no effect on a companion that doesn't have a juvenile form.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Juvenile Companion|Spell Effect: Juvenile Companion]]\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (2nd)** The duration increases to 1 hour."
