    desc: "You sift through myriad potential futures, seize upon one potential moment in which the target meets a particularly gruesome and fatal end, and then show it a vision of its impending demise. The intense mental vision grows more and more terrifying to the target as the doom grows closer, and it takes 3 rounds to reach its conclusion. The target must attempt a Will saving throw to determine the effects. At the end of the spell's duration, if the target was affected, the target witnesses its death and takes 6d6 mental damage.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature is unaffected for 1 round. On the second round, it becomes [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]]. Finally, on the third round, it becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]]. At the end of the third round, it takes half damage.\n\n**Failure** The creature is immediately off-guard. On the second round, it becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]]. Finally, on the third round, it also becomes [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]]. At the end of the third round, the creature takes full damage.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature is immediately off-guard and [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 3]].
