    desc: "**Trigger** A creature within 30 feet casts an arcane spell.\n* * *\n\nYou gather the embers of another caster's spell, using your understanding of unified magic to pick apart their formulas and incantations well enough to imitate the spell yourself, if only for a short time. Until the end of your next turn, you can Cast the triggering Spell by expending a wizard spell slot of the same rank. That caster's spells can't trigger your _interdisciplinary incantation_ again for 24 hours."
