    desc: "A powerful globe of chilling moonlight explodes in the area, dealing 8d10 cold damage to all creatures in the area, plus an additional 8d10 vitality damage to undead creatures.\n\n_Moonburst_'s cold damage is silver damage for the purposes of weaknesses, resistances, and the like. Each creature and object in the area must attempt a Reflex save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature takes half damage.\n\n**Failure** The creature takes full damage.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature takes full damage and becomes [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] permanently. If the globe overlaps with an area of magical darkness, _moonburst_ attempts to counteract the darkness effect.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The cold damage increases by 1d10, and the vitality damage against undead increases by 1d10."
