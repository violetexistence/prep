It also gets a benefit based on a phase of the moon, starting with the new moon and changing to the next phase at the end of each of its turns.\n\n*   **New Moon** The target receives no benefit.\n*   **Waxing Moon** The target gains a +1 status bonus to attack rolls and a +4 status bonus to damage rolls.\n*   **Full Moon** The target gains a +1 status bonus to attack rolls, AC, and saves, and a +4 status bonus to damage.\n*   **Waning Moon** The target gains a +1 status bonus to AC and saving throws.
