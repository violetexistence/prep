    desc: "Your voice calls a storm of songbirds that whirl around you and peck at your enemies. All creatures within the area of whirling birds become [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]], and all creatures outside the area become concealed to creatures within it. A creature other than you that enters or ends its turn in the area takes 1d6 piercing damage as the birds peck at it.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+2)** The damage increases by 1d6."
