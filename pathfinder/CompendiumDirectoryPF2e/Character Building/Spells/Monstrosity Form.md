    desc: "You transform into the shape of a legendary monster, assuming a Huge battle form. You must have enough space to expand into or the spell is lost. When you cast this spell, choose phoenix, cave worm, or sea serpent. While in this form, you gain the beast trait (for phoenix) or the animal trait (for cave worm or sea serpent). You can Dismiss the spell.\n\nYou gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of which battle form you choose:\n\n*   AC = 20 + your level. Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction.\n*   20 temporary Hit Points.\n*   Darkvision.\n*   One or more unarmed melee attacks specific to the battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you can Strike with. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +28, and you use the listed damage. These attacks are Strength based (for the purpose of the [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled]] condition, for example). If your unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead.\n*   Athletics modifier of +30, unless your own modifier is higher.\n\nYou also gain specific abilities based on the type of monster you choose:\n\n*   **[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Monstrosity Form (Cave Worm)|Cave Worm]]**\n    *   Speed 40 feet, burrow 30 feet, swim 20 feet;\n    *   **Melee** `pf2:1` jaws (reach 10 feet), **Damage** 2d12+20 piercing;\n    *   **Melee** `pf2:1` stinger (agile, reach 10 feet), **Damage** 2d8+15 piercing plus 2d6 persistent poison;\n    *   **Melee** `pf2:1` body (reach 10 feet) **Damage** 2d8+20 bludgeoning;\n    *   **Inexorable** You automatically recover from the [[Conditions/Paralyzed|Paralyzed]], [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed]], and [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned]] conditions at the end of each of your turns. You're also immune to being [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] and ignore difficult terrain and greater difficult terrain.\n\n*   **[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Monstrosity Form (Phoenix)|Phoenix]]**\n    *   Speed 30 feet, fly 90 feet;\n    *   **Melee** `pf2:1` beak (reach 15 feet), **Damage** 2d6+12 piercing plus 2d4 fire and 2d4 persistent fire;\n    *   **Melee** `pf2:1` talon (agile, reach 15 feet), **Damage** 2d8+12 slashing;\n    *   **Shroud of Flame** (aura, fire, primal) 20 feet. You gain an aura of fire that extends out from you. A creature that enters or ends its turn within the aura takes 2d6 fire damage. A creature can take this damage only once per turn. You can activate or deactivate this aura with a Sustain action.\n*   **[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Monstrosity Form (Sea Serpent)|Sea Serpent]]**\n    *   Speed 20 feet, swim 90 feet;\n    *   **Melee** `pf2:1` jaws (reach 15 feet), **Damage** 2d12+20 piercing;\n    *   **Melee** `pf2:1` tail (reach 25 feet), **Damage** 2d8+20 bludgeoning;\n    *   **Spine Rake** `pf2:2` (move) You extend your spines and Swim or Stride.
