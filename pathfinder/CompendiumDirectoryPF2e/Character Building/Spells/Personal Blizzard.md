    desc: "Your patron's breath becomes blizzard of obscuring, scouring ice that follows your target. The target attempts a Fortitude save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The target takes 1d6 cold damage, and the spell ends.\n\n**Failure** The target takes 1d6 cold damage and 1d6 persistent cold damage. The persistent damage automatically ends when the spell ends. It is [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] to other creatures, and other creatures are concealed to it.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but both the cold damage and the persistent cold damage increase to 2d6.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The cold damage and persistent cold damage increase by 1 (2 on a critical failure)."
