The creature is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature is [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] for 1 round.\n\n**Failure** The creature is dazzled for 1 minute.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature gains [[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Light Blindness|Light Blindness]] for 1 minute. If the creature is already exposed to bright light, it immediately becomes [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] until the end of its next turn, as it isn't acclimated to its newly acquired light blindness.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (6th)** You can target up to 10 creatures."
