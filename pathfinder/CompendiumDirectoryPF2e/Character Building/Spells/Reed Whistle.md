    desc: "You enchant a blade of grass that you can easily hold in your mouth without inhibiting your speech or other actions. As a reaction, you can reduce the spell's remaining duration by 1 hour to Point Out a creature you detect as you sharply whistle through the reed. You and your allies also gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to [[Actions/Seek|Seek]] the creature for 1d4 rounds.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (3rd)** The spell's duration becomes 4 hours."
