    desc: "Animals, plants, and fungi in the area turn against the targets. Each target suffers from the following effects as long as it remains in the area.\n\n*   Vegetation springs up from every surface, giving each target a â€“10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speed any time it's adjacent to the plants and fungi.\n*   Aggressive animals attack unpredictably. At the start of its turn, each target rolls a `DC 8 Flat check`. On a failure, it's attacked by creatures that deal 2d10 slashing damage. The target attempts a basic Reflex save and is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] for 1 round on any outcome other than a critical success.\n*   The target loses any connection to nature or natural creatures. The target must succeed at a `DC 5 Flat check` when casting any primal spell or the spell fails. Furthermore, animal, fungus, and plant creatures become hostile to it, even one with a strong bond to the target, such as an animal companion.\n    \n\nThe GM might decide that you can't subject some creatures, such as an emissary of a nature deity, to the ire of nature."
