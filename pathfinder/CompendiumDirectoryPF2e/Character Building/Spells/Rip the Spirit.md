    desc: "You supernaturally rip the spirit from a living creature's body, dooming the target to pain and death. The target takes 5d6 void damage, depending on its basic Fortitude save, and is [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]] if it fails its save. The spell's effect is based on how many actions you spend when Casting the Spell.\n\n`pf2:1` **(somatic)** The spell targets one living creature in range.\n\n`pf2:2` **(somatic, verbal)** The spell targets one living creature in range and the damage is 10d6 void damage instead of 5d6.\n\n`pf2:3` **(material, somatic, verbal)** The spell targets all living creatures in a 30-foot emanation.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The amount of damage increases by 1d6, or by 2d6 for the 2-action version."
