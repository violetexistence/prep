If the target takes damage, a willing creature within the hex's range gains fast healing 1 for as long as you Sustain the hex. The target takes damage only once from this spell, whether or not you Sustain it.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Trade Death for Life|Spell Effect: Trade Death for Life]]\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d4 and the fast healing increases by 1."
