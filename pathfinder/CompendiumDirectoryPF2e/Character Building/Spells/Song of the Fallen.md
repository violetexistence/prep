    desc: "You chant a dirge or an elegy that either rouses the dead to action or reminds undead that they should lay to rest.\n\nIf you target dead creatures, the bodies animate and can continue acting as if they were alive. A creature animated in this way has 60 temporary Hit Points. The animated creatures are slowed 1 but can otherwise act normally. Creatures animated with this spell die again once the spell ends.\n\nIf you target undead creatures, each undead must attempt a basic Will save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The undead takes 5d6 vitality damage.\n\n**Success** The undead takes 10d6 vitality damage and is [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] for 1 round.\n\n**Failure** The undead takes 100 vitality damage and is [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] for 1 minute.\n\n**Critical Failure** The undead is destroyed."
