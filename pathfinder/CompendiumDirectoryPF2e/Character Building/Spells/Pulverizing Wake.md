    desc: "Imitating raptorial creatures, you attack with such speed it drives a sonic shockwave. Make a melee Strike against a creature in your reach; if you hit, you deal an additional 3d8 sonic damage. Regardless of the result of your Strike, that creature becomes the point of origin of a 15-foot cone, aimed directly away from you. All creatures in that cone take 6d8 sonic damage (basic Fortitude save).\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The damage of the cone increases by 1d8."
