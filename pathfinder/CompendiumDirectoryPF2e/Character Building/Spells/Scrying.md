    desc: "You magically spy on a creature of your choice. _Scrying_ works like [[Spells/Clairvoyance|Clairvoyance]], except that the image you receive is less precise, insufficient for _teleport_ and similar spells. Instead of creating an eye in a set location within 500 feet, you instead create an eye that manifests just above the target. You can choose a target either by name or by touching one of its possessions or a piece of its body. If you haven't met the target in person, _scrying_'s DC is 2 lower, and if you are unaware of the target's identity (perhaps because you found an unknown creature's fang at a crime scene), the DC is instead 10 lower.\n\nThe effect of _scrying_ depends on the target's Will save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The spell fails and the target is temporarily immune for 1 week. The target also gains a glimpse of you and learns its rough distance and direction from you.\n\n**Success** The spell fails and the target is temporarily immune for 1 day.\n\n**Failure** The spell succeeds.\n\n**Critical Failure** The spell succeeds, and the eye follows the target if it moves, traveling up to 60 feet per round."
