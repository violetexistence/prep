    desc: "You ask for the guidance of supernatural entities, granting the target a +1 status bonus to one attack roll, Perception check, saving throw, or skill check the target attempts before the duration ends. The target chooses which roll to use the bonus on before rolling. If the target uses the bonus, the spell ends. Either way, the target is then temporarily immune for 1 hour.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Guidance|Spell Effect: Guidance]]\n\n[[Spell Effects/Effect_ Guidance Immunity|Effect: Guidance Immunity]]"
