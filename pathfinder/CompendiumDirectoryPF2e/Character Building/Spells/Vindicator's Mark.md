    desc: "You launch a magical dart at your hunted prey, which marks them with a nimbus only you can detect. Make a spell attack against the target. On a hit, you deal 2d4 spirit damage and the target is marked by a glowing nimbus of energy that only you can see. For the duration of your spell, the marked target takes an additional +2 damage from all your weapon or unarmed attacks. [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]] targets marked by your _vindicator's mark_ are [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] to you, rather than [[Conditions/Undetected|Undetected]].\n\nYou can Dismiss the spell on your turn if your last action dealt damage to the target with a weapon or unarmed attack, instantly dealing an additional 2d6 spirit damage to it.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Vindicator's Mark|Spell Effect: Vindicator's Mark]]\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+2)** The initial damage increases by 2d4, the additional damage you deal increases by 1, and the damage dealt when the spell is Dismissed increases by 1d6."
