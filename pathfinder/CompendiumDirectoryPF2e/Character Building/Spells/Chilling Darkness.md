    desc: "You shoot an utterly cold ray of darkness tinged with unholy energy. Make a ranged spell attack. The ray deals 5d6 cold damage. If the target has the holy trait, you deal an extra 5d6 spirit damage.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target takes double damage.\n\n**Success** The target takes full damage.\n\nIf the ray passes through an area of magical light or targets a creature affected by magical light, _chilling darkness_ attempts to counteract the light. If you need to determine whether the ray passes through an area of light, draw a line between yourself and the spell's target.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The cold damage increases by 2d6, and the spirit damage against holy creatures increases by 2d6."
