    desc: "You conjure magical shields of force to protect your allies around you. You and each ally who ends their turn within the emanation gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until they leave the emanation or the spell ends, whichever comes first. If an ally takes physical damage or damage from a spell or magical effect while being granted this bonus, they can choose to end the bonus for themselves as a free action to gain resistance 10 to all damage against the triggering damage. If they do, they become temporarily immune to the effects of _shielding formation_ for 10 minutes. You can do the same by spending your reaction; if you do, you can't cast _shielding formation_ again for 10 minutes, though you can continue Sustaining the benefits for others.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Shielding Formation|Spell Effect: Shielding Formation]]"
