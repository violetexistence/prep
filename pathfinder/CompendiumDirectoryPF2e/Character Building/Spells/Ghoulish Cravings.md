    desc: "You touch the target to afflict it with the overwhelming desire to eat raw meat. The target must attempt a Will save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The target is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] by its unbidden hunger.\n\n**Failure** The target is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]] and can't reduce this condition below sickened 1 until it first consumes some raw meat; if the creature doesn't have access to raw meat, it can take a bite out of a corpse within reach as an Interact action.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target can't reduce the condition below sickened 2 until it consumes raw meat."
