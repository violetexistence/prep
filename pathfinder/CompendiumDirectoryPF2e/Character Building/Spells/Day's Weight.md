    desc: "You fast-forward time for a single creature, burdening it with the aches and pain of an entire day and making it temporarily tired and weak. The creature must attempt a Fortitude save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The target is [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]] and [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]] for 1 round.\n\n**Failure** The target is fatigued and enfeebled 1 for the duration.\n\n**Critical Failure** The target is fatigued and [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 2]] for the duration. The fatigued condition doesn't end when the spell's duration does (but can still be removed with a night's rest or by similar means).\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (6th)** You can target up to 10 creatures."
