    desc: "**Requirements** You're mostly or totally submerged in water.\n* * *\n\nYou temporarily shape your lower limbs into the tail of a hippocampus in order to swim away from a nearby foe after dealing a parting blow. Attempt a melee spell attack roll against the target's AC, dealing 2d6 bludgeoning damage on a hit (or double damage on a critical hit). Then, Swim up to 30 feet; if you already have a swim Speed, you can Swim up to your Speed with a +10-foot circumstance bonus. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your AC against reactions triggered by this movement. At the end of the movement, your lower limbs return to normal.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Hippocampus Retreat|Spell Effect: Hippocampus Retreat]]\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d6."
