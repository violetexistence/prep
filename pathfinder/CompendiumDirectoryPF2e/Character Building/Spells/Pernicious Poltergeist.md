    desc: "You create an echo of a powerful poltergeist, temporarily anchoring it to the area to terrorize and harm any opponents foolish enough to remain in the area. Because the poltergeist is a manifestation and is not truly present, it can't be attacked or hurt; it remains [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]] unless otherwise stated. When you Cast the Spell, and the first time you Sustain it on subsequent rounds, the poltergeist creates your choice of one of the following effects.\n\n*   **Deathly Assault** (negative) The poltergeist focuses on one creature in the area and flies through that creature's space, dealing 4d10 void damage (`Fortitude check` save).\n*   **Frighten** (emotion, fear, mental) The poltergeist becomes visible, appearing as a skeletal, ghostlike humanoid. Creatures in the area must attempt a `Will check` save, becoming [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] on a failure.\n*   **Telekinetic Storm** (force) The poltergeist hurls debris and quasi-real objects around in the area. All creatures in the area take 4d8 force damage (`Reflex check` save).\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+2)** The damage of the deathly assault effect increases by 1d10, and the damage of the telekinetic storm effect increases by 1d8."
