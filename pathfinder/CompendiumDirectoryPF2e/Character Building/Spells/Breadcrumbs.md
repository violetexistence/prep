    desc: "You protect your target from going astray in hostile territory by tracking where it's already been, helping it deduce where it still needs to go. The target leaves a glittering trail behind it that lasts for the spell's duration. This trail doesn't denote the direction or the order of its path-it merely indicates where the target has moved during the spell's duration.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (2nd)** The duration increases to 8 hours.\n\n**Heightened (3rd)** The duration increases to last until your next daily preparations."
