    desc: "You travel on a rushing wind. Move two times: two Strides, two Steps, or one Stride and one Step (in either order). You can Stride or Step into the air during this movement, moving upward at a 45-degree angle at most; if you end your movement in the air, you fall after taking one action or when your turn ends, whichever comes first. A [[Spells/Wall of Wind|Wall of Wind]] appears in all the spaces you left during this movement, lasting for 1 round.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (5th)** The _wall of wind_ lasts 3 rounds."
