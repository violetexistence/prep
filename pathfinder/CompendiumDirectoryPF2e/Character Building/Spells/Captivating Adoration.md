If a creature is in the aura when you Cast the Spell or when a creature enters the area for the first time, it must attempt a Will saving throw. If a creature leaves and reenters, it uses the results of its original save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected and temporarily immune for 1 hour.\n\n**Success** The creature is [[Conditions/Fascinated|Fascinated]] with you for its next action, then is temporarily immune for 1 hour.\n\n**Failure** The creature is Fascinated with you.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature is Fascinated with you, and its attitude toward you improves by one step.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** Increase the size of the emanation by 15 feet."
