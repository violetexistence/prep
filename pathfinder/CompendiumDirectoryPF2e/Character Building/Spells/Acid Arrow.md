    desc: "You conjure an arrow of acid that keeps corroding the target after it hits. Make a spell attack against the target. On a hit, you deal 3d8 acid damage plus 1d6 persistent acid damage. On a critical hit, double the initial damage, but not the persistent damage.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+2)** The initial damage increases by 2d8, and the persistent acid damage increases by 1d6."
