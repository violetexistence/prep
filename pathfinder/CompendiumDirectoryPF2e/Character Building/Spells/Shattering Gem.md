    desc: "A large gem floats around the target in an erratic pattern. The gem has 5 Hit Points. Each time a creature Strikes the target, the target attempts a `DC 11 Flat check`. On a success, the gem blocks the attack, so the attack first damages the gem and then applies any remaining damage to the target. If the gem is reduced to 0 Hit Points, it shatters, immediately dealing 1d8 slashing damage (basic Reflex save) to the creature that destroyed it, as long as that creature is within 10 feet of the target.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The gem has 5 additional Hit Points, and the damage dealt by its detonation increases by 1d8."
