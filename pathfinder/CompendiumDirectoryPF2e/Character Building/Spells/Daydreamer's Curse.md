    desc: "You impose a curse upon the target that renders it easily distracted and unable to focus its thoughts on tasks that demand insight or discernment. The target must attempt a Will save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** For 10 minutes, the target must roll twice and use the worse result whenever attempting a Medicine, Nature, Perception, or Survival check. If the target critically succeeds at a Perception check or skill check to perform an action with the concentrate trait, the target gets a success instead.\n\n**Failure** As success, but the effect is permanent.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, except the target treats the outcomes of all checks with the concentrate trait as one degree of success worse than the result it rolled (a critical success becomes a success, a success becomes a failure, and a failure becomes a critical failure)."
