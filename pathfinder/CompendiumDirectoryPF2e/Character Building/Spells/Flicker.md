    desc: "You flicker quickly between your current plane and another. You gain resistance 5 to all damage, except force. At the end of each of your turns, you automatically teleport 10 feet in a random direction, as determined by the GM. You can Sustain the spell to teleport in this way.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Flicker|Spell Effect: Flicker]]\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+2)** The resistance increases by 3."
