    desc: "You steal a creature's shadow, leaving it weakened and vulnerable. The target must attempt a Fortitude save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The target is [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]] for 1 round.\n\n**Failure** The target takes 3d4 void damage and is [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]] for the spell's duration as you tear its shadow away, collecting it in your hand. On subsequent rounds, the first time each round you [[Actions/Sustain|Sustain the Spell]], you can throttle the shadow to deal 3d4 void damage to the target (basic Fortitude save). Until the spell ends, the target doesn't cast a shadow.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target is [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 2]].\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The damage when the spell is cast and when it is sustained increases by 1d4 void."
