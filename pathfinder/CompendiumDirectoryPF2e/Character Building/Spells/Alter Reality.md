    desc: "You use your occult lore and the power of your mind to manipulate the spiritual multiverse, resulting in any of the following effects:\n\n*   Duplicate any occult spell of 9th rank or lower to which you have access.\n*   Duplicate any spell from another spell list of 7th rank or lower. It must be common or you must have access.\n*   Produce any effect whose power is in line with the above.\n*   Reverse certain effects that refer to the [[Spells/Wish|Wish]] spell.\n\nAt the GM's discretion, you can try to produce greater effects, but this is dangerous and the spell may have only a partial effect."
