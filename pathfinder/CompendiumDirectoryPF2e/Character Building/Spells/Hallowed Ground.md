    desc: "One small space becomes inhospitable to undead as you fill it with life-infused benevolent magic. Each undead creature in the area takes 1d6 vitality damage and 1d4 spirit damage when you Cast the Spell, with a basic Fortitude save. After that, undead creatures have weakness 1 to vitality damage and your necromancy spells while in the area.\n\nThis spell also automatically attempts to counteract any attempt to raise undead in the area (if either the undead would appear in the area or the effect's caster or creator is in it).\n\nIf you Cast this Spell again, any previous _hallowed ground_ you had cast ends.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Hallowed Ground|Spell Effect: Hallowed Ground]]\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+2)** The vitality damage increases by 1d6, spirit damage increases by 1d4, and weakness increases by 1."
