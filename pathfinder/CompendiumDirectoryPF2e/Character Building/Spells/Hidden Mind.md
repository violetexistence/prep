    desc: "Powerful wards hide a creature from magic that would spy on it or affect its mind. The target gains a +4 status bonus to saves against mental effects. _Hidden mind_ attempts to counteract any detection, revelation, and scrying effects as if its spell rank were 1 higher than its actual rank. On a success, the effect functions normally except that it detects nothing about the target and its possessions. For instance, _detect magic_ would still detect other magic in the area, but not any magic on the target.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Hidden Mind|Spell Effect: Hidden Mind]]"
