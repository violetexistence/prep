    desc: "Your jaw unhinges as your teeth extend into wicked fangs. For the spell's duration, you gain a fangs unarmed attack. They're a finesse, grapple, unarmed attack that deals 1d8 piercing damage and an extra 2d10 poison damage. If you have a creature at least one size smaller than you [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] with your fangs, you can use the [[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Swallow Whole|Swallow Whole]] ability that deals 4d6 bludgeoning damage and has a Rupture value of 17. A swallowed creature is transported to an extraplanar space that resembles the inside of a snake's stomach, so when it gets free, it appears in a space adjacent to you. If you're killed or the spell ends, the swallowed creature is immediately freed.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Snake Fangs|Spell Effect: Snake Fangs]]\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+3)** The extra poison damage of your fangs unarmed attack increases by 1d10, the damage dealt by the Swallow Whole ability increases by 6d6, and the Rupture value increases by 9."
