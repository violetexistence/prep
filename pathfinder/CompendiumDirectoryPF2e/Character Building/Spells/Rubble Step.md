    desc: "The target leaves behind a trail of shifting rubble that typically consists of stones, but you could choose another earthen material, such as loose sand or soil. For 2 rounds, when the target willingly moves out of a space, and if the target is in contact with the ground, the ground in that space becomes difficult terrain. The difficult terrain remains for the spell's duration.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (4th)** The target leaves difficult terrain behind for 1 minute instead of two rounds, and the spell's duration is 10 minutes."
