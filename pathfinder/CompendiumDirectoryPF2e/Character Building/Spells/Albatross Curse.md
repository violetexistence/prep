    desc: "You create a spectral albatross, a guiding bird for sailors, to hover around the target. You and allies within 30 feet of the target gain a +1 circumstance bonus to attacks against the target. The target creature can spend an action to Strike the albatross, which automatically succeeds and kills it. The target must then attempt a Will save against your spell DC.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Albatross Curse|Spell Effect: Albatross Curse]]\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The guilt of slaughtering a bird of good fortune weighs on the target's mind. The target is [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] for 1 round.\n\n**Failure** The albatross hangs around a cord from the target's neck (or closest equivalent) for 1 minute, cursing them for their transgression. During this time, the target must roll twice and take the worse result on their next Will save, after which the albatross disappears.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Albatross Curse (Failure)|Spell Effect: Albatross Curse (Failure)]]\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the duration is 1 hour.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Albatross Curse (Critical Failure)|Spell Effect: Albatross Curse (Critical Failure)]]"
