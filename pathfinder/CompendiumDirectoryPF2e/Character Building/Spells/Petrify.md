    desc: "The target's body slowly turns into a stone statue. The target must attempt a Fortitude save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The target is [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] for 1 round as stone begins to form on their body.\n\n**Failure** The target is slowed 1 and must attempt a Fortitude save at the end of each of its turns; this ongoing save has the incapacitation trait. On a failed save, the slowed condition increases by 1 (or 2 on a critical failure) as stone growths creep across their body. A successful save reduces the slowed condition by 1. When a creature becomes fully unable to act due to the slowed condition from _petrify_, the spell then ends in a flash of gray light, leaving the target [[Conditions/Petrified|Petrified]] permanently as they become a statue. The spell also ends if the slowed condition is removed, which causes the stone to break off harmlessly.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target is initially [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 2]]."
