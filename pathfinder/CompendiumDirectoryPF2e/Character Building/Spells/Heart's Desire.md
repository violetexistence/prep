    desc: "You surround your target with wondrous illusions of their greatest desires, which distract them from reality. The target must attempt a Will save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target disbelieves the illusion and is unaffected.\n\n**Success** For 1 round, the target is [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] and takes a -2 status penalty to any checks it makes to determine the effects of reactions.\n\n**Failure** For 1 minute, the target is stupefied 2 and can't use reactions.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, and all spaces are difficult terrain for the target.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+2)** You can target one additional creature."
