    desc: "You call forth a divine cataclysm from your deity, destroying living and undead creatures in the area alike. Creatures in the area take 10d6 void damage and 10d6 alignment damage (good, evil, lawful, or chaotic), chosen from among the alignments your deity has. If your deity is true neutral, increase the void damage by 4d6 instead of dealing alignment damage. A creature harmed by vitality damage, such as one with void healing, takes vitality damage instead of void damage from this spell.\n\nYou can't cast this spell if you don't have a deity. This spell gains the trait corresponding to the alignment damage dealt.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d6 void damage, 1d6 alignment damage, and 1d6 additional void and vitality damage for a true neutral deity.\n* * *\n\nLeveled Void + Spirit Damage\n\nLeveled Vitality + Spirit Damage\n* * *\n\nLeveled Void Damage\n\nLeveled Vitality Damage"
