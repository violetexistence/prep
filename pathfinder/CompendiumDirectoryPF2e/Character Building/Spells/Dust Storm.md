    desc: "You call forth a swirling storm of dust. The _dust storm_ obscures vision, with the effect of [[Spells/Mist|Mist]]. The dust also makes the air unbreathable; creatures in the area must hold their breath, though wearing a scarf or similar clothing over the mouth increases the time the creature can hold its breath to 5 rounds. Creatures entering or starting their turn in the _dust storm_ take 1d6 slashing damage. Creatures that have the water trait or that are made primarily of liquid take double damage.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+2)** The damage increases by 1d6."
