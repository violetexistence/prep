    desc: "You call upon your muse to greatly increase the benefits you provide with your _courageous anthem_, _rallying anthem_, or _song of strength_ composition. If your next action is to cast one of these compositions, attempt a `Performance check` check. The DC is usually the highest Will DC of the composition's targets, but the GM can assign a different DC based on the circumstances. The effect of your composition depends on the result of your check.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Fortissimo Composition|Spell Effect: Fortissimo Composition]]\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The status bonus from your composition increases to +3.\n\n**Success** The status bonus from your composition increases to +2.\n\n**Failure** Your composition provides only its normal bonus of +1, but you don't spend the Focus Point for casting this spell."
