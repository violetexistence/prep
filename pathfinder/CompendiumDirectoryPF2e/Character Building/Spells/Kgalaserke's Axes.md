    desc: "The folklore and tales surrounding the legendary hero Kgalaserke are so widespread and well known that a hundred lifetimes would not be enough to have accomplished everything she is reputed to have done. Nevertheless, the stories all contain a unifying theme of her martial prowess despite the odds being stacked against her.\n\n`pf2:1` You briefly describe Kgalaserke's signature axes and how she came to receive them. The target gains a +1 status bonus to attack rolls for the spell's duration.\n\n`pf2:2` You revel in a tale of Kgalaserke striking down a foe after a struggle. For the spell's duration, when the target is damaged by a creature's attack, the target gains a +2 circumstance bonus to damage against that creature for 1 round.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Kgalaserke's Axes|Spell Effect: Kgalaserke's Axes]]"
