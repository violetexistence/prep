    desc: "A ghostly iron maiden snaps shut on the target and drains its vitality for your gain. This deals 4d4 piercing damage and 4d4 void damage, and the target must attempt a Fortitude save. You gain temporary Hit Points equal to the void damage the target takes (after applying resistances, weaknesses, and the like). You lose any remaining temporary Hit Points after 1 minute.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The target takes half damage.\n\n**Failure** The target is briefly trapped within the vampiric maiden. The target takes full damage and is [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] by the iron maiden for 1 round or until it uses an Interact action to extricate itself, whichever comes first.\n\n**Critical Failure** The target takes double damage and is immobilized by the vampiric maiden for 1 round or until it [[Actions/Escape|Escapes]] (the DC is your spell DC), whichever comes first.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The piercing and void damage increase by 1d4 each."
