    desc: "You create a volume of faint shimmering light that resembles a flowing river and sheds dim light for 10 feet on each side. The river begins in an adjacent square to you and extends in a straight 5-foot path to its maximum range or until it hits a solid wall, whichever comes first. A creature that begins its turn in the river or enters one of the river's spaces must attempt a Will save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature ignores the river's effects until the start of its next turn.\n\n**Success** The creature treats all squares occupied by the river as difficult terrain until the start of its next turn. If the creature is undead or a nindoru fiend, it takes 2d6 mental damage.\n\n**Failure** As success, but the creature is also knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]. If the creature is undead or a nindoru fiend, it takes 4d6 mental damage.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature is pushed 20 feet along the river's path in the direction of flow. If the creature is undead or a nindoru fiend, it takes 8d6 mental damage.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The mental damage increases by 1d6."
