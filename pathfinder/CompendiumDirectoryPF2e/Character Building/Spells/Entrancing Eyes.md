    desc: "Your eyes glow with an entrancing radiance that captivates those who meet your gaze. Any creature that ends its turn within the emanation must attempt a Will save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected and becomes immune to this particular casting of the spell.\n\n**Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Failure** Until the end of its next turn, the target is [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] and [[Conditions/Fascinated|Fascinated]].\n\n**Critical Failure** Until the end of its next turn, the target is [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 4]], Fascinated, and can't take reactions. In addition, all creatures and objects other than you are [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] from the target.\n* * *\n\nDuring any round you Sustain the Spell, you can use a single action, which has the manipulate trait, to focus your entrancing eyes on a single creature you can see within 30 feet. This creature must immediately make a Will save against the spell as if it were ending its turn in the emanation. If the creature was already Fascinated by your entrancing eyes before its save, a failed save causes it to be [[Conditions/Paralyzed|Paralyzed]] for 1 round. You can't use this action to focus on the same creature more than once per round."
