    desc: "You take on the stance of the flowing winds, sending out waves of energy at a distance. You can make wind crash unarmed Strikes as ranged Strikes against targets within 30 feet. These deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage; are in the brawling group; and have the agile, nonlethal, propulsive, and unarmed traits. Wind crash Strikes ignore [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealment]] and all cover.\n\nWhile in _wild winds stance_, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against ranged attacks.\n\n[[Feat_Feature Effects/Stance_ Wild Winds Stance|Stance: Wild Winds Stance]]"
