    desc: "You snatch creatures from the jaws of death, restoring them without the straing of a typical close call. You can spend 1 to 3 actions Casting this Spell, and you can target a number of creatures equal to the actions spent. Each target regains 3d6 Hit Points. If the target had the [[Conditions/Dying|Dying]] condition, coming back from Dying due to this healing doesn't increase its [[Conditions/Wounded|Wounded]] condition.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** Increase the healing by 1d6."
