    desc: "You can pilfer an object even if it's outside the reach of your fingers. You teleport the target into one of your open hands. If you don't have a hand free, it falls to the ground at your feet.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (3rd)** The range increases to 120 feet.\n\n**Heightened (5th)** The range increases to 120 feet, and you can target an unattended object with a Bulk of 1 or less.\n\n**Heightened (7th)** As 5th rank, and when you Cast the Spell you can spend 3 actions instead of 1 to increase the range to planetary. If you do, you don't need line of sight to the target, but you must be extremely familiar with the target."
