    desc: "Three faintly glowing wisps of fire float around your head. Each time you hit a creature with a Strike, one of the wisps goes hurtling towards that creature, dealing 1d4 fire damage. If you Cast a Spell with the fire trait while you have fewer than three wisps, a new wisp appears.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Flame Wisp|Spell Effect: Flame Wisp]]\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+2)** The damage increases by 1d4."
