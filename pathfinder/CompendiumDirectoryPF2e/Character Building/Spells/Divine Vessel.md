Choose an alignment your deity has (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful). You can't cast this spell if you don't have a deity or your deity is true neutral. This spell gains the trait of the alignment you chose.\n\nIf you were Medium or smaller, you become Large, as the effects of [[Spells/Enlarge|Enlarge]].
