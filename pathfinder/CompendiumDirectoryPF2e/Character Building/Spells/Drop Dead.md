    desc: "**Trigger** A creature within range is hit by an attack from an enemy.\n* * *\n\nThe target appears to fall down dead, though it actually turns [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]]. Its illusory corpse remains where it fell, complete with a believable fatal wound. This illusion looks and feels like a dead body. If the target's death seems absurd—for instance, a barbarian at full health appears to be slain by 2 damage—the GM can grant the attacker an immediate `Perception check` check to disbelieve the illusion. If the target uses hostile actions, the spell ends. This ends the entire spell, so the illusory corpse disappears too.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (7th)** The spell doesn't end if the target uses a hostile action."
