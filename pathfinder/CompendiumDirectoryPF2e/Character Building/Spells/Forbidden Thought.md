    desc: "You place a psychic lock in a foe's mind that prevents it from a specific action. Choose \"Strike,\" \"Stride,\" \"Cast a Spell,\" or a specific action you know the creature to have (such as \"Breath Weapon\" against a dragon). If the creature attempts that action on its next turn, it must surmount your lock to do so, causing it to take 2d6 mental damage (with a basic Will save). The target is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d6."
