    desc: "You cut your own body in a ritualistic manner, causing similar damage to a creature in your line of sight. These cuts are superficial and cause 1d4 slashing damage to you; however, the wounds that open up on our target's body are far deeper. The targeted creature takes 5d8 slashing damage; a creature that critically fails this saving throw also takes 1d8 + 4 -4 bleed damage. If you cast this as a three-action spell, the spell instead affects a 5-foot burst.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** Increase the damage dealt to the target by 1d8, and increase the persistent bleed damage by 1."
