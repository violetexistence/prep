    desc: "You expand the target's ability to understand social cues that are normally beyond its comprehension. Any creature to which the target isn't unfriendly or hostile can use Diplomacy to [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] on it and to make very simple Requests of it. This doesn't render the animal any more inclined to help than it otherwise would be.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (4th)** The spell can also target plants and fungi."
