    desc: "You utter a curse that a creature will meet a certain endâ€”a death by freezing, stabbing, or another means you devise. Choose one type of damage from the following list: acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, piercing, slashing, sonic, or void. The effect is based on the target's Fortitude save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The target gains weakness 2 to the chosen damage type until the end of your next turn.\n\n**Failure** As success, but the duration is 1 minute. If the creature is reduced to 0 Hit Points by the chosen damage and its level is 7 or less, it dies.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the duration is unlimited.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+2)** The weakness increases by 1, and the maximum level of creature that can be automatically killed increases by 4.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Seal Fate|Spell Effect: Seal Fate]]"
