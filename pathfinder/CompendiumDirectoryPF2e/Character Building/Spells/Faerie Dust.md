For each additional action you use when Casting the Spell, increase the burst's radius by 5 feet.\n* * *\n\n**Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Failure** The creature can't use reactions and takes a -2 status penalty to Perception checks and Will saves.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Faerie Dust (Failure)|Spell Effect: Faerie Dust (Failure)]]\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, and the creature also takes a -1 status penalty to Perception checks and Will saves for 1 minute.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Faerie Dust (Critical Failure)|Spell Effect: Faerie Dust (Critical Failure)]]\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+3)** The initial radius increases by 5 feet."
