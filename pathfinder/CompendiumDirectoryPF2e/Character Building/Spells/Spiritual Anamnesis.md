    desc: "Memories of a past life that seem incredibly real (and may even be) overwhelm the target's mind. This is especially disorienting for undead and creatures that have lived a previous life (such as celestials, fiends, monitors, and many other extraplanar creatures); if such creatures roll a critical success on their save, they get a success instead, and if they roll a failure, they get a critical failure instead.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature is [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] for 1 round.\n\n**Failure** The target is [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] for 1 minute and babbles about the visions, possibly providing information about what they saw.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target is also [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 3]]."
