    desc: "You protect a physical structure from the devastation caused by immense creatures. This structure can be artificially constructed, like a castle or wall, or a natural subject, like a specific tree or grove. A given casting of this ritual can protect a subject as small as a single-story house and no larger than the wall surrounding a large city.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** As success, but the target structure also doubles its Hit Points and Broken Threshold.\n\n**Success** The target structure gains a +4 status bonus to AC and its Hardness increases by 10. It also gains resistance 20 to acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic damage; this resistance applies before its Hardness. These benefits apply only to attacks made by Gargantuan creatures or siege engines.\n\n**Failure** The ritual doesn't succeed.\n\n**Critical Failure** The target is considerably weakened, reducing its Hardness by 10 (minimum 0)."
