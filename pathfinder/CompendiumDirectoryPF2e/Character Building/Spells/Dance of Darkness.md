    desc: "You dance, [[Actions/Stride|Striding]] up to half your Speed. At either the start or end of your Stride, you create an area of magical darkness in a 10-foot burst centered on your location. This area is filled with magical darkness that works the same way as that created by a [[Spells/Darkness|Darkness]] spell of the same rank. When you create the darkness, attempt a Performance check to dance, with a standard DC for your level, to determine the duration of the darkness.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** 1 minute\n\n**Success** 2 rounds\n\n**Failure** 1 round"
