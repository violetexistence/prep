    desc: "You transport yourself to either a celestial plane or a world in the Universe where worshippers of your patron can be found. You must be of no higher level than double angelic messenger's spell rank.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** As success, but if you've never visited that plane or world before, you appear right in front of the message's intended recipient.\n\n**Success** You arrive on the target plane or world at the last location you visited on that plane or world, or to a random location within 10d10 miles of your message's intended recipient if you've never visited that plane or world before.\n\n**Failure** You don't travel.\n\n**Critical Failure** You accidentally travel to the wrong plane, possibly a dangerous plane."
