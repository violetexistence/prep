    desc: "An understanding of how violence begets more violence fills your target, causing it mental anguish when it attempts to take violent actions. The target must attempt a Will saving throw.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The next time the target takes a hostile action, the target takes 1d4 mental damage; the spell's duration then ends.\n\n**Failure** The first time in a round when the target takes a hostile action, the target takes 1d4 mental damage.\n\n**Critical Failure** Each time the target takes a hostile action, the target takes 1d4 mental damage.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The mental damage increases by 1d4."
