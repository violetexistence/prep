    desc: "You cause any spells cast on the target to spill out their energy in harmful surges. The target must attempt a Will save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** Whenever the target becomes affected by a spell with a duration, the target takes 2d12 persistent force damage. Each time it takes persistent force damage from _spellwrack_, it reduces the remaining duration of spells affecting it by 1 round. Only a successful `Arcana check` check against your spell DC can help the target recover from the persistent damage; the curse and the persistent damage end after 1 minute.\n\n**Failure** As success, but the curse and persistent damage do not end on their own.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the persistent force damage is 4d12 persistent force."
