    desc: "As tools of violence undone by violence, broken weapons contain potent symbolic magic that faydhaans often call upon when forming alliances. Images of similar legendary weapons overlay the target, and the weapon's broken condition is suppressed for the duration. The weapon gains the nonlethal trait during this time. The weapon's wielder can apply the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls, if any, to their Diplomacy checks. If the weapon would be damaged or broken again, this spell ends."
