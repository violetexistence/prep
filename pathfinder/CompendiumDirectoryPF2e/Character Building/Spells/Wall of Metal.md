    desc: "You call forth a sheet of metal, forming a wall of iron, low-grade cold iron, or standard-grade silver up to 60 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1/4 inch thick. The wall doesn't need to stand vertically but must form a straight line in an unbroken open space so it doesn't pass through any creatures or objects, or the spell is lost. Each 10-foot-by-10- foot section of the wall has AC 10 and is immune to critical hits and precision damage. The wall's Hardness, HP, and BT use the statistics of a structure of the material you chose. Creatures can move through a section of the wall that's broken.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (7th)** The wall is high-grade silver or standard-grade dawnsilver.\n\n**Heightened (8th)** The wall is standard-grade cold iron.\n\n**Heightened (9th)** The wall is high-grade dawnsilver.\n\n**Heightened (10th)** The wall is high-grade cold iron or standard-grade adamantine."
