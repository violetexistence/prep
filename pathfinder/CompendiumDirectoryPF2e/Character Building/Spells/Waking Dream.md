    desc: "You cloud the target's mind with vivid, dreamlike imagery, so they have difficulty distinguishing real threats from imagined ones.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The target is distracted by the visions and treats all other creatures as [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] for 1 round, and you can't Sustain the Spell to increase the duration.\n\n**Failure** The target is [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]]. In addition to the creatures present, the target might also attack wildly at thin air, attempting to fend off the dreams. It can attempt a new save at the end of each of its turns to end the confusion. Even if the confused effect ends early, the target treats all other creatures as concealed for 1 round.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target gets no save to end the effect early."
