    desc: "You share some of your own temporal distortions with a foe, altering their mind and body unpredictably as they're thrown backward or forward in time. Roll 1d4. On a 1, the foe becomes clumsy; on a 2, it becomes enfeebled; on a 3, it becomes stupefied; and on a 4, you choose which condition applies.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The target is either [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]], [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]], or [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] for 1 round, depending on the result of the d4.\n\n**Failure** The target is either clumsy 1, enfeebled 1, or stupefied 1 for 4 rounds, depending on the result of the d4.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the time warp is stronger, increasing the condition's effects but making it run its course faster. The condition's value is 3, and the condition lasts for 2 rounds."
