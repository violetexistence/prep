    desc: "A divine beacon radiates serenity, soothing nearby allies.\n\nAllies within the area gain a +1 status bonus to saving throws against emotion effects.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Font of Serenity|Spell Effect: Font of Serenity]]\n\nAn ally can touch the font at the center of the burst as an Interact action; if they do so, the spell attempts to counteract one emotion effect affecting the ally of the ally's choice, after which that emotion effect is temporarily immune for 1 day. If the spell succeeds at the counteract check, it removes the emotion effect from your ally, though not from any other creatures the effect might be affecting.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+4)** The bonus increases by 1."
