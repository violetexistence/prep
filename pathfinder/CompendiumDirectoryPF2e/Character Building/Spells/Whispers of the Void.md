    desc: "You whisper baleful secrets that transcend language and carry magically to the ears of your foes. The words take physical form, weakening the life force of the targets, each of which must attempt a Fortitude save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature takes 2d8 persistent void damage.\n\n**Failure** The creature takes 4d8 persistent void damage and becomes [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]].\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature takes 4d8 persistent void damage and becomes [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 2]] and [[Conditions/Doomed|Doomed 1]].\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+2)** The persistent void damage increases by 1d8 on a success, or by 2d8 on a failure or critical failure."
