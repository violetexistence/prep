    desc: "**Area** 2 adjacent 10-foot cubes\n\nYou warp the structure of earthen material, turning rock into mud or mud into rock. Choose one of these two options when you Cast the Spell.\n\n*   **Rock to Mud** You transform non-magical, unworked, and unattended stone in the area into an equal volume of mud. If you Cast this Spell on a stone floor, it becomes difficult terrain; if the resulting mud is at least 3 feet deep, it is greater difficult terrain, or the creature can try to [[Actions/Swim|Swim]] through it (`DC 10 Athletics check`). If the mud is deep enough that a creature can't reach the bottom, the creature must Swim to move through it. If you Cast this Spell on a ceiling, the falling mud deals 8d6 bludgeoning damage (`Reflex check` save) and spreads out, creating difficult terrain in an area 10 feet larger in radius than the original spell's area. Once the rock is transformed into mud, the mud is non-magical and remains until natural conditions cause it to dry out or otherwise disperse.\n*   **Mud to Rock** Mud in the area turns into unworked stone. If creatures are in the mud when it is transformed to stone, they must attempt a `Reflex check` saving throw.\n    *   **Critical Success** The creature escapes the mud and is atop the stone, unaffected.\n    *   **Success** The creature climbs out of the mud as it turns to rock and is [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] atop the stone.\n    *   **Failure** The creature is partially stuck in the mud and is [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] for 1 round or until it [[Actions/Escape|Escapes]], whichever comes first.\n    *   **Critical Failure** The creature is entirely stuck. It is [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]] for 1 round or until it Escapes, whichever comes first.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+2)** Add an additional 10-foot cube to the area, adjacent to at least one of the other cubes."
