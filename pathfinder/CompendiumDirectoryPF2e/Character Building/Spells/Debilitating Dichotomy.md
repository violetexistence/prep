    desc: "You reveal a glimpse of the impossible conflicts between the divine anathema behind your curse, forcing you to reckon with another's conflicts as well.\n\nYou and the target each take 9d6 mental damage with a basic Will save, and the target is [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]] if it critically fails its save. You get a degree of success one better than you rolled for your saving throw.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 3d6."
