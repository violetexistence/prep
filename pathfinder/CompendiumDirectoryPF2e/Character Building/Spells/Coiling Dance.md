    desc: "You perform a dance that seeks to pass on the knowledge and wisdom of a naga. Your allies in the area are filled with sacred energy, making their spells and attacks holy. Creatures or effects that would be unholy don't gain this benefit\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Coiling Dance|Spell Effect: Coiling Dance]]\n\nWhen you cast or Sustain this spell, you can choose an ally in the area that's [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]], [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]], or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]. They can immediately use a reaction to [[Actions/Escape|Escape]]; they can use your Occultism or Religion modifier for the check instead of their unarmed attack, Acrobatics, or Athletics modifier if that would be better."
