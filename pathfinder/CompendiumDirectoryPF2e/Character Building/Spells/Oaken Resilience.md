    desc: "The target's skin becomes tough, with a consistency like bark or wood. The target gains resistance 2 to bludgeoning and piercing damage and weakness 3 to fire. After the target takes fire damage, it can Dismiss the spell as a free action triggered by taking the damage; doing so doesn't reduce the fire damage the target was dealt.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Oaken Resilience|Spell Effect: Oaken Resilience]]\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+2)** The resistances increase by 2, and the weakness increases by 3."
