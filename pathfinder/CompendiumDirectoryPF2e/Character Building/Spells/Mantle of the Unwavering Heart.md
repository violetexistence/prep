    desc: "Vines and branches envelop you in an instant, growing a wild bloom of colors that open to reveal your new form. Upon Casting this Spell, pick two of the options below. As a single action, which has the concentrate trait, you can change one of your chosen abilities to a different option from the list.\n\n*   **Evergreen Vitality** You gain fast healing 3 and a +2 bonus to saves against poison and disease. This effect has the healing and vitality traits.\n*   **Overwhelming Perfume** (aura, olfactory) A cloud of potent floral scent surrounds you in a 15-foot emanation. Creatures in the aura can't benefit from the scent ability and are [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] as long as they remain in the aura. The sickness is a disease effect.\n*   **Towering Trunk** You grow to a considerable height. Increase your size to Large. You're [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]]. Your reach increases by 5 feet (or by 10 feet if you started out Tiny), and you gain a grasping branch unarmed attack; this attack is in the brawling weapon group and deals 2d8 bludgeoning damage plus Grab.\n*   **Unyielding Will** Your mind becomes incredibly resilient to change. You're immune to being [[Conditions/Fascinated|Fascinated]], and you get a +1 bonus to saves and DCs against mental effects.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Mantle of the Unwavering Heart|Spell Effect: Mantle of the Unwavering Heart]]"
