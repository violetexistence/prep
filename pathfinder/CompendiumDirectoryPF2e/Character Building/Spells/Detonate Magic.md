    desc: "You cause the magic within the target to dissipate in a destructive explosion. You attempt to counteract the target. If the attempt succeeds, an explosion of magical force deals 8d6 force damage with a basic Reflex save. If you successfully counteract the magic of an item, it's deactivated for 1 week (or destroyed on a critical success) and the explosion is a 5-foot emanation from the item. If you successfully counteract a spell, the effect ends and the explosion affects either all creatures in the spell's area or the target of the spell and all creatures in a 5-foot emanation around it."
