    desc: "You create an area of bright light. Creatures with [[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Light Blindness|Light Blindness]] that are [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] by _radiant field_ and remain in the area must attempt a Fortitude save at the start of their turns. On a failure, a creature remains blinded for 1 round; this is an incapacitation effect.\n\nThis spell also suppresses magical darkness of your _radiant field_ spell's rank or lower.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (4th)** Creatures seen through the area are [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] to creatures outside the area. Creatures with light blindness can continue to be blinded by the field as long as the field is visible, even when outside of the field."
