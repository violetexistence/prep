    desc: "You draw an occluding veil of spirits around yourself, blocking yourself especially well from undead eyes. You become [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] to all creatures, and you are [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] from undead creatures regardless of what precise senses they have; this grants the effects of [[Spells/Invisibility|Invisibility]], but against all the undead creature's precise senses. If you physically [[Actions/Interact|Interact]] with an undead creature or use a hostile action, the spell ends.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** You can target one additional willing creature within 30 feet. The spell ends if any target physically Interacts with an undead creature or uses a hostile action."
