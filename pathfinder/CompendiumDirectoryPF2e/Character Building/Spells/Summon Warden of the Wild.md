    desc: "You briefly call forth the spirit of one of the Wardens of the Wild, the legendary guardians of nature. The warden occupies the space of a Gargantuan creature. When you Cast this Spell, you summon a warden depending on the biome in which the spell is cast (for instance, summoning the Warden of Caverns and Burrows if summoned in a cave, canyon, or other underground environment). In an unnatural environment, the warden summoned depends on the region's most recent or similar natural biome, as decided by the GM.\n\n*   **[[Howl of the Wild/Warden of Caverns and Burrows|Warden of Caverns and Burrows]]:** Speed 60 feet, burrow 100 feet; **Arrive** (earth) _Obsidian Cage_ Obsidian stalagmites burst from the earth as the warden surfaces, impaling enemies and trapping them in stalagmites. Enemies on the ground within 40 feet take 6d6 piercing damage (`Reflex check` save). Creatures that fail their save become [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] until they [[Actions/Escape|Escape]] (the DC is your spell DC); **Depart** (earth) _Blessing of the Depths_ The squares occupied by the warden remain disheveled and broken, becoming difficult terrain. The warden affects you and all your allies within 60 feet with a [[Spells/Mountain Resilience|Mountain Resilience]] and [[Spells/Unfettered Pack|Unfettered Pack]]. The duration for both spells is reduced to 3 rounds, but the duration of _mountain resilience_ isn't reduced when an affected target is hit by a bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing attack.\n*   **[[Howl of the Wild/Warden of Forests and Meadows|Warden of Forests and Meadows]]:** Speed 120 feet; **Arrive** (illusion, mental) _Idyllic Panorama_ The warden's presence unpredictably warps the appearances and perceived distances of creatures and obstacles around it. Each time an enemy within 40 feet of the warden attempts a Strike or Stride action, it takes 4d6 mental damage (`Will check` save). On a critical failure, the creature Strikes a random target within reach or Strides in a random direction. On a critical success, the creature becomes temporarily immune for 1 round; **Depart** _Fox's Insightful Trickery_ The warden affects you and all your allies within 60 feet with [[Spells/Blur|Blur]] and [[Spells/Truesight|Truesight]]. The duration for both spells is reduced to 3 rounds.\n*   **[[Howl of the Wild/Warden of Oceans and Rivers|Warden of Oceans and Rivers]]:** Speed 60 feet, swim 120 feet; **Arrive** _I Am the Tide_ If the warden is summoned in a body of water, it creates a churning whirlpool that deals 10d6 bludgeoning damage to all creatures within 30 feet (basic Reflex save). A creature that fails this save is pulled 15 feet closer to the warden (30 feet on a critical failure). If the warden is summoned outside of a body of water, it creates a wave of water that deals 8d6 bludgeoning damage to all creatures within 30 feet (basic Reflex save). A creature that fails this save is pushed 10 feet away from the warden; **Depart** _Acclimation to the Deep_ The warden affects you and your allies within 60 feet with [[Spells/Feet to Fins|Feet to Fins]] and [[Spells/Water Breathing|Water Breathing]]. The duration for both spells is reduced to 3 rounds, but a creature affected by _feet to fins_ retains its normal land Speed.\n*   **[[Howl of the Wild/Warden of Peaks and Skies|Warden of Peaks and Skies]]:** Speed 60 feet, fly 240 feet; **Arrive** _Precipice Plummet_ The warden appears, flying downward from the sky and sends a shockwave where she lands. Creatures within 20 feet take 10d6 sonic damage (`Fortitude check` save). Creatures that critically fail their saves are [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]]; **Depart** (auditory) _Song of the Skies_ The warden affects you and all your allies within 60 feet with [[Spells/Fly|Fly]] and [[Spells/Unfettered Movement|Unfettered Movement]]. The duration for both spells is reduced to 3 rounds."
