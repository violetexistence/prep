    desc: "You draw a card from the harrow, either one from a deck you have in hand or magically produce one as part of the spell. You use the power of the card's suit to influence a creature around you. When you draw a card, you can choose to impart a boon or bane associated with the card's suit. The target must attempt a Will save. On a failure, they receive the effects of the chosen boon or bane. If you target an ally with this spell, they can choose to willingly accept the effects without attempting a saving throw. The target can attempt to remove the card's influence by using an action, which has the concentrate trait, to attempt the saving throw again; on a success, the effect ends.\n\nTo determine the card, draw a card from a harrow deck. If you don't have a harrow deck available, you can roll 1d6 to randomly determine the suit you draw.\n\n**1. Hammers (Str)** Boon: The target gains a +2 status bonus to damage rolls; Bane: The target is [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]].\n\n**2. Keys (Dex)** Boon: The target gains a +1 status bonus to AC; Bane: The target is [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]].\n\n**3. Shields (Con)** Boon: The target gains temporary Hit Points equal to twice the spell's rank; Bane: The target is [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]].\n\n**4. Books (Int)** Boon: The target gains a +1 status bonus to skill checks; Bane: The target is [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]].\n\n**5. Stars (Wis)** Boon: The target gains a +1 status bonus to saving throws; Bane: The target is [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]].\n\n**6. Crowns (Cha)** Boon: The target can roll twice and take the higher result on a single check during the duration. This is a fortune effect; Bane: The target must roll twice and take the lower result on a single check of your choosing during the duration. This is a misfortune effect.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (6th)** The duration is 1 minute. The target must succeed a total of two saving throws to end the effect. The value of boons and banes doubles. The Crowns suit affects a total of three checks during the duration."
