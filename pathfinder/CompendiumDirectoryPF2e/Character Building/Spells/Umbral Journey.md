    desc: "You move partially into the Netherworld, using its warped nature to speed your travels. Each hour, you cover roughly as much ground as you normally would in 3 days. The landmarks are vague and symbolic rather than concrete, leaving you within a mile of your intended destination when you Dismiss the spell or its duration ends"
