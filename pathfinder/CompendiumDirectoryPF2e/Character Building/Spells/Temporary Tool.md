    desc: "You conjure a temporary simple tool, such as a shovel or rope into your hands. It lasts until it's used for a single activity or for 1 minute, whichever comes first, after which it disappears. The tool is obviously temporarily conjured and thus can't be sold or passed off as a genuine item."
