    desc: "You exert magical force to propel a willing creature up to 10 feet in a straight line, including upward, though if they aren't on solid ground or have another way to maintain their height (such as a fly Speed) when the movement ends, they fall. When you Sustain the spell, you can move them again or choose a new target within range and move them instead.\n\nYou can cast this spell on an [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]] ally, and if you do, the movement from this spell doesn't trigger reactions.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (4th)** The distance increases to 20 feet.\n\n**Heightened (7th)** The distance increases to 30 feet."
