    desc: "Your imperious touch erodes the target's willpower, making it easier to control. The target attempts a Will save. Regardless of the result, it's then temporarily immune for 1 hour.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The target is [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] until the end of your next turn.\n\n**Failure** The target is [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] until the end of your next turn.\n\n**Critical Failure** The target is [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] for 1 minute and is forced to its knees, becoming prone."
