    desc: "You attempt to wrest control of a target undead or force it to recognize you as its master. If the target is controlled by another creature, that controller attempts a Will saving throw to retain control; otherwise, the target must attempt a Will save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The target is [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]] and [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]] for 1 round as it fights off your commands.\n\n**Failure** The target becomes controlled by you and follows your orders. It (or the creature previously controlling it) can attempt a new Will save at the end of each of its turns; on a success, the spell ends, and the creature becomes stunned 1 and confused for 1 round. If you issue an obviously self-destructive order, the target doesn't act until you issue a new order.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target (or the creature previously controlling it) receives a new save only if you give it a new order that is against its nature."
