    desc: "You accelerate the processes of decay in the area. Each living creature in the area takes 2d10 void damage with a basic Fortitude save. A creature afflicted by a disease takes a â€“2 circumstance penalty to this save. You can also direct the blight to rot all Small and Tiny non-creature plants in the area, eliminating non-magical undergrowth and any resulting difficult terrain, cover, and concealment. _Sudden blight_ attempts to counteract any magical effect on the plants before withering them.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d10."
