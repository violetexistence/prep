    desc: "You take command of the target, forcing it to obey your orders. If you issue an obviously self-destructive order, the target doesn't act until you issue a new order. The effect depends on its Will save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The target is [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]] as it fights off your commands.\n\n**Failure** You control the target. It gains the [[Conditions/Controlled|Controlled]] condition, but it can attempt a Will save at the end of each of its turns. On a success, the spell ends.\n\n**Critical Failure** As a failure, but the target receives a new save only if you give it a new order that is against its nature, such as killing its allies.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (10th)** The duration is unlimited."
