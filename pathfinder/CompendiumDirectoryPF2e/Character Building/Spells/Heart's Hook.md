    desc: "You drive two creatures toward a fated meeting. Each will be compelled toward the other, but you can elect to have one automatically succeed on its saving throw.\n* * *\n\n**Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Failure** The creature must spend the first action on its next turn to approach its partner. It can't Delay or take any reactions until it has obeyed this urge.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target must use all its actions on its next turn."
