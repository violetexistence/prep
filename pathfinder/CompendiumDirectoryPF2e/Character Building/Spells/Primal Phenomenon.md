    desc: "You request a direct intercession from the natural world. Nature always refuses unnatural requests and might grant a different request (potentially more powerful or better fitting its character) than the one you asked for. A _primal phenomenon_ spell can do any of the following things.\n\n*   Duplicate any spell from the primal spell list of 9th rank or lower to which you have access.\n*   Duplicate any spell from another spell list of 7th rank or lower. It must be common or you must have access.\n*   Produce any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects.\n*   Reverse certain effects that refer to the [[Spells/Wish|Wish]] spell.\n\nAt the GM's discretion, you can try to use _primal phenomenon_ to produce greater effects than these, but doing so may be dangerous, or the spell may have only a partial effect."
