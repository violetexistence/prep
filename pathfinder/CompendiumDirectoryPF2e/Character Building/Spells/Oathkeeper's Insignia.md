    desc: "**Trigger** You make a promise or deal.\n* * *\n\nA magical indicator assures a creature that you've upheld your end of a bargain. When you Cast the Spell, you create a bracelet, flower, or other such trinket. If, while the spell persists, you complete the terms of the promise or deal you made, the trinket fades away with a pleasant chime; if you violate the terms instead, the trinket breaks with a dissonant crash.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (3rd)** The duration becomes 1 day.\n\n**Heightened (5th)** The duration becomes 1 week.\n\n**Heightened (7th)** The duration becomes 1 month.\n\n**Heightened (9th)** The duration becomes 1 year."
