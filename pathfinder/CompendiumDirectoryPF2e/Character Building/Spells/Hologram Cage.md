The walls shed bright light for 10 feet (and dim light for the next 20 feet) and completely block line of sight; creatures within the cage can't be seen by creatures outside of it, though they can see each other, and creatures outside of it can't see into it. You can [[Actions/Dismiss|Dismiss]] the spell, and if you Cast the Spell again, your previous hologram cage ends.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (7th)** The range of the spell increases to 80 feet, and you can expand the cube to be 25 feet on each side."
