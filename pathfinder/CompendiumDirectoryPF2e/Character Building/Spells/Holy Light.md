    desc: "You shine a blazing ray of light tinged with holy energy. Make a ranged spell attack. The ray deals 5d6 fire damage. If the target has the unholy trait, you deal an extra 5d6 spirit damage.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target takes double damage.\n\n**Success** The target takes full damage.\n\nIf the light passes through an area of magical darkness or targets a creature affected by magical darkness, _holy light_ attempts to counteract the darkness. If you need to determine whether the light passes through an area of darkness, draw a line between yourself and the spell's target.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The fire damage increases by 2d6, and the spirit damage against unholy creatures increases by 2d6."
