    desc: "You enchant a single object, preventing it from being used for magical observation. If you cast this spell on a non-magical item used to cast scrying spells, such as a spell component pouch or a spell focus, the item can't be used to cast the spell. If you cast _blind eye_ on a magical item that can be activated to scry (such as a [[Equipment/Crystal Ball (Clear Quartz)|Crystal Ball]] or [[Equipment/Hag Eye|Hag Eye]]), the item can't be activated for scrying effects. Magical items that are twice blind eye's spell rank or more aren't blocked this way."
