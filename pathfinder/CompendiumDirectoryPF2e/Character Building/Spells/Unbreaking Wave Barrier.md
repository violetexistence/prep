    desc: "You create a protective circle around yourself that repels your foes. You gain a +1 status bonus to AC. Any creature other than you within the area, or attempting to move into the area, must attempt a Fortitude saving throw; a creature needs to attempt the Fortitude saving throw only once each round. If a creature pushed by _unbreaking wave barrier_ would be pushed into a solid barrier or another creature, it stops at that point and takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage for every additional 5 feet it would've been pushed. On subsequent rounds, the first time you [[Actions/Sustain|Sustain]] this Spell each round, you can increase the radius of the barrier by 5 feet.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Unbreaking Wave Barrier|Spell Effect: Unbreaking Wave Barrier]]\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature isn't pushed, but the space within the barrier is difficult terrain for it.\n\n**Failure** The creature is pushed 10 feet, and the space within the barrier is difficult terrain for it.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature is pushed 20 feet and knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]], and the space within the barrier is difficult terrain for it."
