    desc: "Vines twine into a wicker horn in your hands, and out spills a single fruit, nut, or similar small bit of produce. A creature who eats the produce with an Interact action regains 1d6+4 HP. The cornucopia, as well as any unconsumed pieces of fruit, wither away at the end of the duration.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The cornucopia produces an additional piece of food. A creature can consume any amount of food from the same casting with a single Interact action. Eating six pieces of produce from the cornucopia gives as much nourishment as one square meal for a typical human.\n\nConsume all produce"
