    desc: "You cause a swirl of energy to entangle the fates of all caught within the blast. Each creature in the area must attempt a Will save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature's fate becomes distorted, and momentary conflicting glimpses of the immediate future cause the creature to become [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the start of its next turn.\n\n**Failure** As success, but the creature is off-guard for the duration of the spell. If more than one of the targets failed to resist this spell, the creature also becomes [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] for the duration of the spell as its fate and those of the other creatures continue to clash and strain against each other.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but any creature that becomes stupefied 1 for the duration of the spell also becomes [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]] and [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] for the spell's duration."
