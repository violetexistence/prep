You and your allies gain a +1 status bonus to saving throws against mental effects while in the area. Whenever someone benefiting from this bonus critically succeeds at a saving throw against an enemy's mental effect, its revelry increases, granting it a +1 status bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls for 1 round.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Frenzied Revelry|Spell Effect: Frenzied Revelry]]\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (4th)** The emanation's radius is 10 feet, and the status bonus to saves is +2.\n\n**Heightened (7th)** The emanation's radius is 15 feet, and the status bonus to saves is +3."
