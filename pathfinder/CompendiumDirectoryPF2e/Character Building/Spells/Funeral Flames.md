    desc: "You transform a bludgeon into a fearsome torch suited to casting undead into the afterlife. One end of the weapon ignites, becoming wreathed in blue flame. While you wield the target weapon, it becomes a +1 weapon, gains the versatile fire trait, and sheds light as brightly as a torch. Whenever you successfully Strike a creature with the weapon, you can Dismiss the spell as a free action to deal 1d6 persistent fire damage to the target; if the target is undead, increase the persistent damage dice to d8s.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Funeral Flames|Spell Effect: Funeral Flames]]\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+2)** The persistent fire damage increases by 1d6."
