    desc: "You implant a subconscious suggestion deep within the target's mind for them to follow when a trigger you specify occurs. You suggest a course of action to the target. Your directive must be phrased in such a way as to seem like a logical course of action to the target, and it can't be self-destructive or obviously against the target's self-interest. The target must attempt a Will save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected and knows you tried to control it.\n\n**Success** The target is unaffected and thinks you were talking to them normally, not casting a spell on them.\n\n**Failure** The suggestion remains in the target's subconscious until the next time you prepare. If the trigger occurs before then, the target immediately follows your suggestion. The effect has a duration of 1 minute, or until the target has completed a finite suggestion or the suggestion becomes self-destructive or has other obvious negative effects.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the duration is 1 hour.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (9th)** You can target up to 10 creatures."
