You can spend an extra action while Casting this Spell and add a cost to the spell to give the creature a â€“2 circumstance penalty to its save. The cost must be a specially gathered object that is anathema to the creature. This spell fails if you aren't on your home plane when you cast it.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target resists being banished and you are [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]].\n\n**Success** The target resists being banished.\n\n**Failure** The target is banished.\n\n**Critical Failure** The target is banished and can't return by any means to the plane it's banished from for 1 week.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (9th)** You can target up to 10 creatures. The extra cost affects targets to which it is anathema."
