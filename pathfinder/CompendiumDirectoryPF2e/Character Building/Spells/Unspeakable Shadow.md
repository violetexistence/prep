    desc: "You alter a creature's shadow, transforming it into a terrifying monster out to devour the creature. The creature must attempt a Will save. A creature that has the frightened condition from _unspeakable shadow_ must spend at least one of its actions each turn to either attack its shadow (making a Strike ineffectually) or flee from its shadow (using one action to move away as though it had the fleeing condition).\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The target is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]].\n\n**Failure** The target is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 3]]. It can't reduce its frightened value below 1 for 1 minute.\n\n**Critical Failure** The target is so afraid, it might instantly die. It must succeed at a Fortitude save or die; this saving throw has the incapacitation trait. If it succeeds at its save, the target is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 4]] and can't reduce its frightened value below 1 for 1 minute."
