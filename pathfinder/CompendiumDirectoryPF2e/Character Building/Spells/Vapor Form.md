It loses any item bonus to AC and all other effects and bonuses from armor, and it uses its proficiency modifier for unarmored defense. It gains resistance 8 to physical damage and is immune to precision damage. It can't cast spells, activate items, or use actions that have the attack or manipulate trait. It gains a fly Speed of 10 feet and can slip through tiny cracks. The target can Dismiss the spell.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Vapor Form|Spell Effect: Vapor Form]]"
