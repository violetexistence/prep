    desc: "The primal power of the world flows through you. You transform into an incarnation of nature, either a green man or a kaiju. Your battle form is Medium for a green man or Gargantuan (30-foot-by-30-foot space) for a kaiju. While in this form, you gain the plant trait (for a green man) or the beast trait (for a kaiju). You can Dismiss the spell. You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of which battle form you choose:\n\n*   AC = 25 + your level. Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction.\n*   30 temporary Hit Points.\n*   Darkvision.\n*   One or more attacks specific to the battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you can Strike with. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +34, and you use the listed damage. These attacks are Strength based (for the purpose of the [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled]] condition, for example). If your unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead.\n*   Athletics modifier of +36, unless your own is higher.\n\nYou gain specific abilities based on the incarnation you choose:\n\n*   **Green Man**\n    *   Speed 40 feet, climb 40 feet;\n    *   **Melee** `pf2:1` vines (reach 30 feet, versatile P), **Damage** 6d8+12 bludgeoning;\n    *   **Ranged** `pf2:1` thorns (range 100 feet), **Damage** 6d6+6 piercing;\n    *   **Green Caress** (aura, primal) 60 feet. Enemies other than plants must succeed at a `Fortitude check` against your spell DC or become [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] for 1 round ([[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 2]] on a critical failure).\n\n*   **Kaiju**\n    *   Speed 50 feet; resistance 5 to physical damage;\n    *   **Melee** `pf2:1` jaws (reach 30 feet), **Damage** 6d10+10 piercing;\n    *   **Melee** `pf2:1` claws (agile, reach 30 feet), **Damage** 6d8+8 slashing;\n    *   **Melee** `pf2:1` foot (agile, reach 15 feet), **Damage** 6d6+10 bludgeoning;\n    *   **Unstoppable** You are immune to being [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] and ignore difficult terrain and greater difficult terrain;\n    *   **Trample** `pf2:3` You move up to double your Speed and move through the spaces of Huge or smaller creatures, trampling each creature whose space you enter. A trampled creature takes foot damage with a `Reflex check` save against your spell DC.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Nature Incarnate|Spell Effect: Nature Incarnate]]"
