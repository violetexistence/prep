When they attempt to [[Actions/Escape|Escape]] an effect that has them [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]], [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]], or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]], they automatically succeed unless the effect is magical and of a higher rank than the _unfettered movement_ spell.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Unfettered Movement|Spell Effect: Unfettered Movement]]"
