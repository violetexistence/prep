    desc: "You unleash energy from the broken connection to your patron. You are [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] from creatures beyond the edge of the emanation but can't use that concealment to [[Actions/Hide|Hide]]. Any creature that begins its turn in the emanation is affected based on your patron's tradition.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Aura_ Manifest Will|Aura: Manifest Will]]\n\n*   **Arcane** Raw energy and magical formulae circulate around you. A creature that begins its turn in the emanation gains weakness 1 to spell damage for 1 round.\n*   **Divine** Divine power crashes in a cycle of life and death. A living or undead creature that begins its turn in the emanation gains 2 temporary Hit Points for 1 round. This effect has the spirit trait.\n*   **Occult** Esoteric symbology etches the air. An allied creature that begins its turn in the emanation has [[Other Effects/Effect_ Cover|Lesser Cover]] while inside the emanation, and for 1 round after it leaves.\n*   **Primal** Plants and fungus symbolic of your patron constantly grow and wither in the emanation. A creature that begins its turn in the emanation has a â€“10-foot status penalty to all its Speeds for 1 round or until it [[Actions/Escape|Escapes]]. This effect has the fungus, plant, and wood traits.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Manifest Will|Spell Effect: Manifest Will]]\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** An arcane manifestation increases its weakness by 1 and a divine manifestation increases its temporary Hit Points by 2."
