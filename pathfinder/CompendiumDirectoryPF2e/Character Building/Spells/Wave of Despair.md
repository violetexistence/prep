    desc: "You inflict despair on creatures in the area. The effects for each creature are determined by its Will save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** For 1 round, the creature can't use reactions and must attempt another save at the start of its turn; on a failure, it is [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] for that turn as it sobs uncontrollably.\n\n**Failure** As success, but the duration is 1 minute.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, and the creature is automatically slowed 1 for 1 minute.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (7th)** The area increases to a 60-foot cone."
