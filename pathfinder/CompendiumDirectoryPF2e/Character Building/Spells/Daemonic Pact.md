    desc: "You call upon the powers of Abaddon to grant you the assistance of a daemon. You call upon a daemon whose level can be no more than double _daemonic pact's_ spell rank, two daemons whose levels are each at least 2 less than double the spell rank, or three daemons whose levels are each at least 3 less than double the spell rank.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** You conjure the daemon or daemons, and they require nothing in return for their service.\n\n**Success** You conjure the daemon or daemons, who serve you willingly, but require a sacrifice in the form of spilled blood (either another creature's or your own).\n\n**Failure** You don't conjure any daemons.\n\n**Critical Failure** You don't conjure any daemons, and the self-sacrifice required to perform the ritual leaves you [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]] (or [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 2]] if the spell rank is 5 or higher)."
