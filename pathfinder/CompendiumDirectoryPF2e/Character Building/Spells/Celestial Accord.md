    desc: "You intervene in a heated disagreement between two creatures, encouraging them to put aside their differences and find some common ground. The emotional heat of the prior moment becomes only a memory. Each target must make a Will save. A creature currently engaged in combat can't get a result worse than success, and a target that is subject to hostility from any other creature ceases to be affected by celestial accord.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature is filled with doubt about its own intentions and feels an urge to cooperate with the other. It has a -2 status penalty to attack rolls against the other target for 1 round.\n\n**Failure** The creature can't make hostile actions against the other target and its attitude toward the other target improves to indifferent for the spell's duration.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature's attitude toward the other target improves to friendly for the duration and is indifferent thereafter (until something happens to change that attitude normally)."
