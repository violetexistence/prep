    desc: "You wrap the targeted creatures in thin, sickly green shrouds that sap information from attackers. The shroud settles about each target's shoulders, granting a +1 status bonus to AC and a +2 status bonus to Stealth checks, both only while the target is in dim light or darkness.\n\nIf a creature deals damage in melee to or touches a cloaked creature, the cloak wraps around the attacker, temporarily connecting the psyches of the cloaked creature and the attacker and violently prying a random piece of interesting information from the attacker's mind. The attacker takes 2d8 mental damage and must attempt a Will save.\n\nAfterward, the spell ends for the cloaked creature, and the attacker is temporarily immune to _mirecloak_ for 24 hours.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The attacker is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The attacker takes half damage.\n\n**Failure** The attacker takes full damage and is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]]. In addition, the cloaked creature gleans a piece of information from the attacker's mind. The details and extent of this information are at the GM's discretion.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the attacker takes double damage and is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]].\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Mirecloak|Spell Effect: Mirecloak]]"
