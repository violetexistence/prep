    desc: "Illusory pain wracks the target, dealing 2d4 mental damage and 1d4 persistent mental damage. The target must attempt a Will save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The target takes full initial damage but no persistent damage, and the spell ends immediately.\n\n**Failure** The target takes full initial and persistent damage, and the target is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]]. If the target recovers from being Sickened, the persistent damage ends and the spell ends.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]].\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 2d4 and the persistent damage by 1d4."
