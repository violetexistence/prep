    desc: "You magnetize a small metal object, such as a nail or coin, and launch it away from you at massive speed. Make a ranged spell attack roll; if the target is wearing metal armor or is made of metal, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your attack roll with _magnetic acceleration_. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage and 3d6 piercing damage, or double damage on a critical hit.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The bludgeoning and piercing damage each increase by 1d6."
