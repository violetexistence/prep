    desc: "You conjure a chilling mist that settles into the bones and makes it difficult to move. This has the effects of mist, except that you can Sustain the spell once per round to move the fog up to 10 feet. A creature that starts its turn in the area takes 6d8 cold damage with a basic Fortitude save. A creature that fails its save is also [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] for 1 minute ([[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 2]] on a critical failure) and takes a â€“10-foot status penalty to Speeds for as long as it's clumsy.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+2)** The damage increases by 3d8."
