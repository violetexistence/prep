    desc: "You bolster your ally with reminders of their physical prowess, granting them additional defenses against harmful mental effects. The target gains a +1 status bonus to saving throws against mental effects and against effects that hinder movement (including those that reduce Speed or apply the [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]], [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]], or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]] conditions). This bonus increases to +2 if the source of the effect has the fear trait.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Strength of Mind|Spell Effect: Strength of Mind]]"
