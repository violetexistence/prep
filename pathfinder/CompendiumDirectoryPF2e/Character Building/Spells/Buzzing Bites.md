    desc: "You evoke buzzing and crawling insects to climb onto a foe's body and bite, dealing 1d4 piercing damage and potentially sickening the foe, depending on its Fortitude save. Once this spell ends, the target becomes temporarily immune for 1 minute.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The target takes half damage.\n\n**Failure** The target takes full damage.\n\n**Critical Failure** The target takes double damage and is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] by the crawling insects. The sickened value can't be reduced below 1 while the spell is active.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d4."
