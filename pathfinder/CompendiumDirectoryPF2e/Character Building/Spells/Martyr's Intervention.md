    desc: "**Trigger** A creature within range would take damage that reduces it to 0 Hit Points\n\n**Requirements** You don't have the wounded condition.\n* * *\n\nYou shield a creature in dire need with your own life force, taking the harm upon yourself to save their life. The target is reduced to 1 Hit Point instead of 0 Hit Points. All remaining damage that was prevented from harming the target creature is instead dealt to you. Both you and the target become [[Conditions/Wounded|Wounded 1]]; targets who are already wounded increased their wounded value by 1."
