    desc: "You multiply the disease within a creature, drawing it into an infectious mist outside their body where it can spread to other creatures. The target must attempt a Will save. If the target is willing, it can choose to take the effects of critical failure.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target receives the benefit of a successful save against the lowest-level disease affecting it.\n\n**Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Failure** One randomly chosen disease affecting the target fills the air in a 15-foot emanation centered on the target. For the spell's duration, any creature that enters or ends its turn within the area is exposed to that disease.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, except the miasma contains all the diseases affecting the target."
