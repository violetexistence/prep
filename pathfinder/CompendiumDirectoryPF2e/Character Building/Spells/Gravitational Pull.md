    desc: "By suddenly altering gravity, you pull the target toward you. The target is pulled 10 feet closer to you unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save. On a critical failure, it's also knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]. The effects of this spell change depending on the number of actions you spend when you Cast this Spell.\n\n`pf2:1` **(somatic)** The spell targets one creature.\n\n`pf2:2` **(somatic, verbal)** The spell targets one creature and pulls the target 20 feet instead of 10.\n\n`pf2:3` **(material, somatic, verbal)** The spell targets up to 5 creatures."
