    desc: "Gnawing worms materialize within the flesh of the target creature, dealing 4d6 piercing damage and 1d6 persistent piercing damage. If the target is a non-skeletal corporeal undead creature, you deal an extra 2d6 persistent piercing damage. The target must attempt a Fortitude save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The worms writhe away harmlessly and the target takes no damage.\n\n**Success** The target takes full initial damage but no persistent damage, and the spell ends immediately.\n\n**Failure** The target takes full initial and persistent damage and is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] due to the pain for as long as it takes persistent damage.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target takes double the initial damage and is also [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] by the pain for as long as it takes persistent damage.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+2)** The initial and persistent damage increase by 2d6 and 1d6, respectively"
