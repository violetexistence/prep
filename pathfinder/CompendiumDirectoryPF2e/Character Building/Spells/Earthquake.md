    desc: "You shake the ground, topple creatures into fissures, and collapse structures. The GM might add additional effects in certain areas. Cliffs might collapse, causing creatures to fall, or a lake might drain as fissures open up below its surface, leaving a morass of quicksand.\n\n*   **Shaking Ground** The ground is difficult terrain, and creatures on it take a -2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls, AC, and skill checks. [[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Earthquake (Shaking Ground)|Spell Effect: Earthquake (Shaking Ground)]]\n*   **Fissures** Each creature on the ground must attempt a Reflex save at the start of its turn to keep its footing and avoid falling into 40-foot-deep fissures that open beneath it. The fissures are permanent, and their sides require successful `DC 15 Athletics check` to Climb.\n*   **Collapse** Structures and ceilings might collapse. The GM rolls a flat check for each (`DC 16 Flat check` for a sturdy structure, `DC 14 Flat check` for an average structure and most natural formations, `DC 9 Flat check` for a shoddy structure, all adjusted higher or lower as the GM sees fit). A collapse deals 11d6 bludgeoning damage to each creature caught in it with a basic Reflex save. A creature falls [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] unless it critically succeeds and falls into a fissure if it critically fails.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (10th)** You create a massive earthquake that can devastate a settlement. The range increases to half a mile and the area to a quarter-mile burst."
