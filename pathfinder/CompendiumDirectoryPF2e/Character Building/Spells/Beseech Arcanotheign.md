    desc: "With a whispered prayer or arcane sending, you conjure Arcanotheign, herald of Nethys. She's a storm of magic, half white and half black, roiling in a vaguely humanoid shape. She occupies the space of a Medium creature and has a Speed of 40 feet and a fly Speed of 60 feet.\n\n**Arrive** (sonic) _Storm's Unbridled Destruction_ Arcanotheign arrives with a flash of light and a cacophonous crash of colliding magic. All enemies in a 60-foot emanation take 8d12 sonic damage with a basic Reflex save. A creature that critically fails is additionally [[Conditions/Deafened|Deafened]] for 10 minutes.\n\n**Depart** (electricity, healing) _Flash of Brilliance_ Arcanotheign fires a powerful arcane blast at one target within 100 feet, dealing 5d12 electricity damage with a basic Reflex save, and a powerful divine blast at one ally, healing 5d12 Hit Points. Then, Arcanotheign asks for payment in the form of a fond memory. If you pay this cost, you lose this memory, Arcanotheign gains this memory, and Arcanotheign whispers a secret into your mind; you can immediately [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] on any subject at mythic proficiency."
