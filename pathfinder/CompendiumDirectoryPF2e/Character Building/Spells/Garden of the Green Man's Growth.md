    desc: "You cast your magic into the earth, calling out to a powerful green man, a verdant lesser deity of nature, to come to your aid. They occupy the space of a Medium creature, have a Speed of 40 feet, and a climb Speed of 40 feet.\n\n**Arrive** (plant) _Verdant Bloom_ The green man erupts from the ground in a burst of lush growth, dealing 10d8 bludgeoning damage to creatures in a 60-foot emanation with a basic Reflex save. Creatures that fail this save are pushed 30 feet away from the green man and are knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]. The area becomes greater difficult terrain for 24 hours.\n\n**Depart** (plant) _Forest of Grasping Vines_ The green man casts out their arms, causing vines to rise from the ground, lash at up to six different creatures, and coil them up. Each of these vines targets a different enemy within 100 feet of the green man and deals 12d6 slashing damage with a basic Reflex save. A creature that fails is [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] until it Escapes (on a critical failure it is [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]] until it Escapes). The [[Actions/Escape|Escape]] DC is your spell DC. Each creature that begins its turn grabbed or [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] by these vines takes an additional 4d6 bludgeoning damage, as the vines continue to squeeze the life from it."
