    desc: "You can communicate telepathically with creatures within 30 feet. Once you establish a connection by communicating with a creature, the communication is two-way. You can communicate only with creatures that share a language with you.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (6th)** You can communicate telepathically with creatures using shared mental imagery even if you don't share a language; _telepathy_ loses the linguistic trait."
