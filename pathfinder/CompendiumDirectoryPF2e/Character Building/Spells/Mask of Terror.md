    desc: "The target appears to be a gruesome and terrifying creature. The effect is unique to each observer, so a human viewing the target might see a demon with bloody fangs, but a demon observing the target might see a glowing angelic visage.\n\nWhen any creature attempts a hostile action against the target, the creature must attempt a Will save. It is then temporarily immune until the end of its next turn.\n\n**Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Failure** The creature becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] before using its action.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]], and its action fails and is wasted.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (8th)** You can target up to 5 creatures. If a creature uses a hostile action or reaction that affects multiple targets simultaneously, it needs to attempt only one save against _mask of terror_."
