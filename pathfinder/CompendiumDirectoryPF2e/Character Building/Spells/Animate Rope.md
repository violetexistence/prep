    desc: "You cause a length or section of [[Equipment/Rope|Rope]] or a rope-like object to animate and follow simple commands. You can give it two commands when you [[Actions/Cast a Spell|Cast the Spell]], and one command each time you [[Actions/Sustain|Sustain the Spell]].\n* * *\n\n*   **Bind** (attack) The Rope attempts to partially bind a creature. Attempt a spell attack roll against the target's Reflex DC. If you succeed, the target takes a -10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speed (-20-foot on a critical success). This ends if the target [[Actions/Escape|Escapes]] against your spell DC or breaks the Rope. (A standard adventuring Rope has Hardness 2, HP 8, and a Broken Threshold of 4.) [[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Animate Rope|Spell Effect: Animate Rope]]\n*   **Coil** The Rope forms a tidy, coiled stack.\n*   **Crawl** The Rope inches along the ground like a snake, moving one of its ends 10 feet. The Rope must move along a surface, but that surface doesn't need to be horizontal.\n*   **Knot** The Rope ties a sturdy knot in itself.\n*   **Loop** The Rope forms a simple loop at one or both ends, or straightens itself back out.\n*   **Tie** The Rope ties itself around a willing creature or an object that's unattended or attended by a willing creature.\n*   **Undo** The Rope undoes one of its knots, ties, or bindings.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+2)** The range increases by 50 feet, and you can animate 50 more feet of Rope."
