    desc: "Drawing on the purifying powers of water, you call forth a veil of fine water droplets suffused with holy energy. The veil surrounds the target. Everything on each side of the veil is [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] from creatures on the opposite side, but the water doesn't impede attacks or movement across the veil. If the target moves through the veil, it takes 4d6 spirit damage with a basic Will save. If the target leaves the veil, the spell ends.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The spirit damage increases by 1d6."
