    desc: "You conjure a vicious barbed spear and hurl it at a foe. Make a ranged spell attack roll, dealing 1d8 piercing damage on a success and double damage on a critical success. The spear remains lodged within a creature it hits, making the target [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] (or increasing its clumsy condition by 1 if it is already clumsy) for 1 minute or until the spear is removed with a successful Athletics check against your spell DC as an Interact action, whichever comes first.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The initial damage increases by 1d8."
