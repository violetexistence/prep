    desc: "You extend your senses through a multitude of crawling and flying creatures. You create a crawling swarm in your square. You can hear through the swarm as if using your normal auditory senses. When you Cast this Spell and the first time you Sustain it each round, you can move the swarm 10 feet along the ground in any direction. The swarm has AC 15 and a +0 bonus to its saves.
