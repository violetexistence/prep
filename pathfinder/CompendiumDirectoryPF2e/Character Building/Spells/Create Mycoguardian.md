    desc: "You transform the target into an fungus creature with a level up to that allowed in the below table. There are many versions of this ritual, each specific to a particular type of mycoguardian, and the rituals that create rare mycroguardians are also rare.\n\n## Table 7-1: Creatures Creation Rituals\n\n  \n\n| Creature Level | Spell Rank Required | Cost |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| -1 or 0 | 2 | 15 gp |\n| 1 | 2 | 60 gp |\n| 2 | 3 | 105 gp |\n| 3 | 3 | 180 gp |\n| 4 | 4 | 300 gp |\n| 5 | 4 | 480 gp |\n| 6 | 5 | 750 gp |\n| 7 | 5 | 1,080 gp |\n| 8 | 6 | 1,500 gp |\n| 9 | 6 | 2,100 gp |\n| 10 | 7 | 3,000 gp |\n| 11 | 7 | 4,200 gp |\n| 12 | 8 | 6,000 gp |\n| 13 | 8 | 9,000 gp |\n| 14 | 9 | 13,500 gp |\n| 15 | 9 | 19,500 gp |\n| 16 | 10 | 30,000 gp |\n| 17 | 10 | 45,000 gp |\n\n**Critical Success** The target becomes an fungal creature of the appropriate type. If it's at least 4 levels lower than you, you can make it a minion. This gives it the minion trait, meaning it can use 2 actions when you command it, and commanding it is a single action that has the auditory and concentrate traits. You can have a maximum of four minions under your control. If it's intelligent and doesn't become a minion, the mycoguardian is helpful to you. If it's unintelligent and doesn't become a minion, you can give it one simple command. It pursues that goal single-mindedly, ignoring any of your subsequent commands.\n\n**Success** As critical success, except an intelligent mycoguardian that doesn't become your minion is only friendly to you, and an unintelligent undead that doesn't become your minion leaves you alone unless you attack it. It marauds the local area rather than following your command.\n\n**Failure** You fail to create the mycoguardian.\n\n**Critical Failure** You create the mycoguardian, but its soul, tortured by your foul necromancy, is full of nothing but hatred for you. It attempts to destroy you."
