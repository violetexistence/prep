    desc: "You unleash a sickly gray beam of toxic spores at your target. Make a spell attack against the target. If you hit a non-magical object that's made of organic material (such as a tree, wooden house, or massive skull), it melts away into a foul-smelling sludge. A single casting can destroy no more than a 10-foot cube of matter.\n\nIf you hit a creature, it takes 6d12 poison damage and 6d12 spirit damage with a basic Fortitude save. If you critically hit, the target gets a result one degree of success worse than the outcome of its Fortitude save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The target takes half damage.\n\n**Failure** The target takes full damage. Fungal tendrils swiftly digest the body and reduce it to sludgeâ€”the target takes 2d12 persistent acid damage.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target takes double damage, plus 4d12 persistent acid damage.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The poison damage and spirit damage each increase by 1d12."
