(The [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] condition is not a poison effect.)\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]].\n\n**Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] and [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] while in the cloud.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]] and [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] until it leaves the cloud."
