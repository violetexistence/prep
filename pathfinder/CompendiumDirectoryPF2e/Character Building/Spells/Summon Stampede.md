    desc: "You summon an unstoppable stampede of panicking beasts. Whether you conjure wild beasts or tamed cattle, the stampede is a force of nature that leaves behind nothing in its wake. The stampede occupies the space of a Gargantuan creature and has a Speed of 60 feet.\n\n**Arrive**(emotion, fear, mental) _Foreboding Tremors_ The sheer energy of a stampede can cause even apex predators to panic. Each creature within a 60-foot emanation must attempt a Will save with the following effects.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]].\n\n**Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]].\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 3]] and [[Conditions/Fleeing|Fleeing]] for 1 round.\n* * *\n\n**Depart**_Flatten the Earth_ The stampede Strides up to double its Speed, trampling each Large or smaller creature, hazard, and structure whose space it enters, dealing 8d8 bludgeoning damage (basic Reflex save). The stampede ignores and attempts to counteract all difficult terrain it enters caused by debris, overgrowth, rubble, or thick ground cover."
