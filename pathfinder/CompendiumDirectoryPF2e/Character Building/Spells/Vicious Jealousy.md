    desc: "The target is overcome by deep jealousy and resentment that twists its mind against other creatures. It must attempt a Will save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** For 1 round, the target no longer treats anyone as its allies. The spell then ends.\n\n**Failure** The target no longer treats anyone as its allies. The target can't take the [[Actions/Aid|Aid]] reaction or any action that would directly benefit another creature, such as casting a beneficial spell on them, though it can still take actions that indirectly benefit other creatures, such as fighting the same foes.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, and whenever the target starts its turn within reach of a creature it previously considered an ally, it must spend its first action on its turn to berate the creature or otherwise wave it away.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (4th)** You can target up to 10 creatures."
