    desc: "You cast your thoughts through a creature's mind, sifting for information. You access the target's memories and knowledge unless it fends you off with a Will save.\n\n**Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Failure** Each round of the spell's duration, you can Sustain the spell to ask a different question and attempt to uncover the answer. For each question, the target can attempt a Deception check against your spell DC; if the target succeeds, you don't learn the answer, and on a critical success, the target gives you a false answer that you believe is truthful Once you've asked the target a given question, asking it again, even with a separate casting of mind probe, produces the same result.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, and the target takes a â€“4 circumstance penalty to Deception checks against your questions."
