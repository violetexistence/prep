    desc: "A cloud of cascading, ever-changing colors manifests in the air. Creatures are [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] while inside the cloud, as are those within 20 feet of the cloud's area. A creature must attempt a Will save if it is inside the cloud when you cast it, enters the cloud, ends its turn within the cloud, or uses a [[Actions/Seek|Seek]] or Interact action on the cloud. A creature currently affected by the cloud doesn't need to attempt new saves.\n* * *\n\n**Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]] for 1d4 rounds.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned]] for 1d4 rounds. After the stunned condition ends, the creature is confused for the remaining duration of the spell."
