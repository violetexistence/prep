You remain at 1 Hit Point, and your skin takes on a slight warm glow.\n\nFor the next minute, any time you would regain Hit Points from a healing effect, this magic amplifies the effect, and you regain an additional 8 Hit Points.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The additional healing increases by 2 Hit Points.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Capital Dividend|Spell Effect: Capital Dividend]]"
