    desc: "You afflict the target with the curse of the roiling, unforgiving sea. The target must attempt a Will save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The target becomes [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]]. Reducing its sickened condition to 0 ends the curse.\n\n**Failure** The target becomes sickened 1 and can't reduce its sickened condition below 1 while the curse remains. The curse can be lifted by 4th-rank [[Spells/Cleanse Affliction|Cleanse Affliction]] or similar magic. Whenever the target is sickened and on the water at least a mile from shore, it is also [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]].\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target becomes [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]]."
