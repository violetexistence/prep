This deals 1d8 mental damage with a basic Will save.\n\nIf the target fails the save, you sort through the stolen memories to attempt a single check to [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]]. Choose a skill that has the Recall Knowledge action, and use the target's skill modifier for the check.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The mental damage increases by 1d8."
