    desc: "You gain a vague glimpse of the future. During the casting of this spell, ask about the results of a particular course of action. The spell can predict results up to 30 minutes into the future and reveal the GM's best guess among the following outcomes: good, bad, mixed (the results will be a mix of good and bad), and nothing (there won't be particularly good or bad results).\n\nThe GM rolls a secret `DC 6 Flat check`. On a failure, the result is always \"nothing.\" This makes it impossible to tell whether a \"nothing\" result is accurate. If anyone asks about the same topic as the first casting of _augury_ during an additional casting, the GM uses the secret roll result from the first casting. If circumstances change, though, it's possible to get a different result."
