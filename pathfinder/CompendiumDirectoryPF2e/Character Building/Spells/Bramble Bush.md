    desc: "In a sudden burst of growth, you cause a thorned bush to sprout from the ground, lash around, and wither. Any creature in the area takes 1d4 piercing damage with a basic Reflex saving throw.\n\nUntil the start of your next turn, the area is difficult terrain and hazardous terrain. Any creature entering the square takes 1d4 + ceil(1 / 2) - 1 piercing damage with a basic Reflex saving throw.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+2)** The initial damage increases by 1d4, and the damage dealt by hazardous terrain increases by 1."
