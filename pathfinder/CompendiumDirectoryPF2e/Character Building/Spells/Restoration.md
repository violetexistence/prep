    desc: "Restorative magic counters the effects of toxins or conditions that prevent a creature from functioning at its best. When you cast restoration, choose to either reduce a condition or lessen the effect of a toxin. A creature can benefit from only one restoration spell each day, and it can't benefit from restoration more than once to reduce the stage of the same exposure to a given toxin.\n\n*   **Lessen a Toxin** Reduce the stage of one toxin the target suffers from by one stage. This can't reduce the stage below stage 1 or cure the affliction.\n*   **Reduce a Condition** Reduce the value of the target's [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy]], [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled]], or [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied]] condition by 2. You can instead reduce two of the listed conditions by 1 each.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (4th)** Add [[Conditions/Drained|Drained]] to the list of conditions you can reduce. When you lessen a toxin, reduce the stage by two. You also gain a third option that allows you to reduce the target's [[Conditions/Doomed|Doomed]] value by 1. You can't use this to reduce a permanent Doomed condition.\n\n**Heightened (6th)** As the 4th-rank restoration, but you can reduce a permanent Doomed condition if you add a spellcasting action and a material component while Casting the Spell, during which you provide 100 gp worth of diamond dust as a cost."
