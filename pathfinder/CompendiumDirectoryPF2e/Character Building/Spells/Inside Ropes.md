    desc: "You pull a large handful of guts from your midsection. Removing these guts doesn't harm you. You can use the guts as 50 feet of rope to help you [[Actions/Climb|Climb]], and they help attach you to a wall. You move half as quickly as usual while climbing with your guts (minimum 5 feet), but you can attempt a `DC 5 Flat check` check whenever you critically fail to prevent a fall. Other creatures can use your guts to climb like a squishy rope, but the guts don't help anyone but you attach to a wall. If you let go of your guts or your guts are damaged, the spell ends.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (3rd)** You gain a +1 item bonus to Athletics checks to Climb while using your guts.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Inside Ropes (3rd Rank)|Spell Effect: Inside Ropes (3rd Rank)]]"
