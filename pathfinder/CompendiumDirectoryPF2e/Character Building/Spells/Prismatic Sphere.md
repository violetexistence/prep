    desc: "You create a seven-layered sphere to protect an area. This multicolored sphere functions like a [[Spells/Prismatic Wall|Prismatic Wall]] but is shaped in a 10-foot burst centered on a corner of your space. You must form the sphere in an unbroken open space so its edges don't pass through any creatures or objects, or the spell is lost."
