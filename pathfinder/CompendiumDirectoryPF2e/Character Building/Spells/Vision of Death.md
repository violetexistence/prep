If the target is reduced to 0 HP by this spell, its vision becomes reality and kills it instantly.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The target takes half damage and is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]].\n\n**Failure** The target takes full damage and is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]].\n\n**Critical Failure** The target takes double damage, is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 4]] and is [[Conditions/Fleeing|Fleeing]] for as long as it's frightened.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 2d6."
