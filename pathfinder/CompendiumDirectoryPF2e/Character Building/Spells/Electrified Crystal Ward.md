    desc: "You create an [[Hazards (Rulebooks)/Electric Latch Rune|Electric Latch Rune]] hazard on the target, creating a special crystalline lock on the object. You can also substitute your spell DC for any of the hazard's listed DCs. You can have only one such hazard active at a time, and if you cast this spell while a previous _electric latch rune_ is active, the older hazard discharges harmlessly.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+2)** The hazard's damage increases by 1d12."
