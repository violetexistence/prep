    desc: "You pour vitality energy into ordinary stones, granting them temporary magical properties. You can target 1 non-magical stone or sling bullet for every action you use [[Actions/Cast a Spell|Casting this Spell]]. The stones must be unattended or carried by you or a willing ally. The stones become _+1 striking disrupting [[Equipment/Sling Bullets|Sling Bullets]]_. Each stone can be used only once, after which it crumbles to dust.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Magic Stone|Spell Effect: Magic Stone]]"
