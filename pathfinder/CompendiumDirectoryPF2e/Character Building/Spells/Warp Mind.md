    desc: "You scramble a creature's mental faculties and sensory input. The target must attempt a Will saving throw. Regardless of the result of that save, the target is then temporarily immune for 10 minutes. Warp mind's effects happen instantly, so [[Spells/Dispel Magic|Dispel Magic]] and other effects that counteract spells can't counteract them. However, [[Spells/Wish|Wish]] rituals and abilities that can remove non-magical effects can still counteract the effects.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The target spends the first action on its next turn with the [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]] condition.\n\n**Failure** The target is Confused for 1 minute.\n\n**Critical Failure** The target is Confused permanently."
