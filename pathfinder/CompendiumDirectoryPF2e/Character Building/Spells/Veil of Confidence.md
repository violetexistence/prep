    desc: "You surround yourself in a veil of confidence. You reduce your current [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened]] condition by 1, and whenever you would become Frightened during the duration, reduce the amount by 1. If you critically fail a save against fear, _veil of confidence_ reduces your frightened value from that effect, and then ends."
