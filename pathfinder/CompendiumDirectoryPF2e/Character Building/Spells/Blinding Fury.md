    desc: "**Trigger** A creature damages you.\n* * *\n\nYou curse the target with your outrage at being attacked. The effect is determined by the target's Will save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The target can't [[Conditions/Observed|Observe]] you until the end of its turn, and if you're currently observed by it, you become [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] to it.\n\n**Failure** As success, and for 1 minute, every time the target damages you, it can't observe you until the end of its turn.\n\n**Critical Failure** As success, and for an unlimited duration, the first time each round the target damages a creature, it can't observe that creature until the end of its turn. If it damages several creatures at once, the creature it can't perceive is chosen randomly among those creatures."
