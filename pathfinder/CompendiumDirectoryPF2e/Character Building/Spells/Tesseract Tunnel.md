    desc: "You race from point to point, tearing open a tunnel in space. You create a portal in your current space and then [[Actions/Stride|Stride]], creating another portal in the space you end your Stride. Until the beginning of your next turn, any creature that enters the first portal can immediately transport itself to the exit portal as part of its move action, which adds the teleportation trait to its movement.\n\nYou can have only one _tesseract tunnel_ open at a time; creating another causes the first to immediately close. You can use _tesseract tunnel_ while [[Actions/Burrow|Burrowing]], [[Actions/Climb|Climbing]], [[Actions/Fly|Flying]], or [[Actions/Swim|Swimming]] instead of Striding if you have the corresponding movement type."
