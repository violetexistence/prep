    desc: "You create a simple illusory sound or vision. A sound adds the auditory trait to the spell and the sound can't include intelligible words or elaborate music. A vision adds the visual trait, can be no larger than a 5-foot cube, and is clearly crude and undetailed if viewed from within 15 feet. When you Cast or Sustain the Spell, you can attempt to [[Actions/Create a Diversion|Create a Diversion]] with the illusion, gaining a +2 circumstance bonus to your Deception check. If the attempt fails against a creature, that creature disbelieves the _figment_.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Figment|Spell Effect: Figment]]"
