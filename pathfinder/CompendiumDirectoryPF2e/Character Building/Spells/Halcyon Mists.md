    desc: "In a moment of dire need, you call upon ancestral power to strengthen and sustain. A soothing mist gathers around the target, granting 1d8 temporary Hit Points and ending one source of persistent acid, bleed, fire, poison, or void damage affecting it. If the creature has persistent damage from more than one of these sources, you choose the one that ends.\n\nThe mists linger around the target, making them [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] until the beginning of their next turn, though this obvious concealment can't be used to Hide.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The temporary Hit Points increase by 1d8.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Halcyon Mists|Spell Effect: Halcyon Mists]]"
