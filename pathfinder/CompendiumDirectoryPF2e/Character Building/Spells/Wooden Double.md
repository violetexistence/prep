    desc: "**Trigger** You're critically hit by a damage-dealing effect or a Strike.\n* * *\n\nA wooden double appears out of nowhere and takes the blow in your place. Take a Step action. A wooden block of your size and roughly shaped like you appears in the space you left and absorbs the hit. This block has Hardness 5 and 20 Hit Points. If the wooden block is destroyed, you take any excess damage that the block didn't absorb. After taking the blow, the wooden block collapses into a pile of splinters and dust.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The block's Hit Points increase by 10."
