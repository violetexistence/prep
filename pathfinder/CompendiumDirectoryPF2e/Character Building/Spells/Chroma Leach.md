    desc: "Your hand glows with impossible colors from beyond the stars, and your touch saps both color and vitality from the living. The target must attempt a Fortitude save; creatures with the gnome trait take a â€“2 circumstance penalty to this save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The target is [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 2]] for 1 round.\n\n**Failure** The target is enfeebled 2 for 1 minute and [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]]. The target is also filled with listlessness and ennui. For 1 round, if the target tries to use a move action, it must succeed at a Will save against your spell DC or the action is lost; this effect has the mental and emotion traits.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature is permanently enfeebled 2 and [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 2]] (although magic such as [[Spells/Sound Body|Sound Body]] can remove these conditions)."
