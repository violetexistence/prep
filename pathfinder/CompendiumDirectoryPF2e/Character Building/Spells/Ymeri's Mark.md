    desc: "You place the fiery mark of the Queen of the Inferno on the target, burning into the creature's very essence. The mark gives off a heat that only you can sense; as long as you're on the same plane as the target, you can sense the direction it's in. The target is [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]] and can't reduce the value of this condition normally.\n\nYou can detonate the mark at any point during its duration by Dismissing the spell. The rune explodes in a 10-foot emanation centered on the target that deals 5d6 fire damage with a basic Reflex save. You choose whether the mark's target is included in the explosion.\n\nWhen you cast the spell, the target attempts a Fortitude save to determine how long the mark lasts. If the spell's duration elapses, the rune doesn't detonate.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The duration is 1 minute.\n\n**Failure** The duration is 1 week.\n\n**Critical Failure** The duration is unlimited.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 2d6."
