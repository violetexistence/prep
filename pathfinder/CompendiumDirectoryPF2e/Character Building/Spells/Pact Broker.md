    desc: "You offer to broker a pact of peace. If the target accepts and doesn't take hostile actions against you and your allies during the hex's duration, you take a –1 status penalty to Deception checks to Lie to them. If they refuse and take a hostile action against you or an ally during the hex's duration, they must first attempt a Will save. If they accepted the offer and then take a hostile action against you or an ally during the hex's duration, they must first attempt a Will save and treat the result as one category worse. Regardless of the outcome, the target is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.\n\n**Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Failure** The target takes 2d4 mental damage and a –1 status penalty to attack and damage rolls against you and your allies for the hex's duration.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the penalty is –2.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Pact Broker|Spell Effect: Pact Broker]]\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d4."
