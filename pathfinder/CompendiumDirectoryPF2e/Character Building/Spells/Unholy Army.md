    desc: "Reaching out to the legions of the wicked, you call upon them for assistance. They emerge, bubbling up from the ground, and stand to face your enemies, malevolent and ready for bloodshed. The unholy army occupies the space of a Huge creature. When you Cast this Spell, choose one of the unholy squadrons below to summon.\n\n*   **Asuras** Speed 40 feet\n    \n    *   **Arrive** _Dance of Duality_ A legion of adhukaits arrive on the field, dancing and scurrying in and among your enemy's front line. All enemies in a 10-foot emanation take 10d6 slashing damage (basic Reflex save) as the adhukaits slash at them with their kukris\n    *   **Depart** _Split Remembrance_ As the adhukaits begin to retreat, they argue about who did the most damage and decide to see which half is stronger. All enemies in a 20-foot emanation take 6d6 bludgeoning damage (basic Fortitude save) as they're violently yanked by adhukaits. On a failure, a creature is [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] for 1 minute ([[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 2]] on a critical failure).\n*   **Daemons** Speed 25 feet, fly 40 feet\n    \n    *   **Arrive** (disease) _Winds of Pestilence_ Leukodaemons fly into position, their wings beating with the dust of a thousand diseases of a thousand years. Enemies in a 60-foot cone take 8d8 piercing damage (basic Fortitude save). On a failure, a creature is also [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] ([[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]] on a critical failure)\n    *   **Depart** (disease) _Remember Me_ The leukodaemons claw at your enemies with their infected nails. All enemies in a 10-foot emanation take 6d6 slashing damage (basic Reflex save). On a failure, a creature is also [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]] ([[Conditions/Drained|Drained 2]] on a critical failure).\n*   **Demons** Speed 25 feet\n    \n    *   **Arrive** (fire) _Fuming Entrance_ A legion of brimoraks arrive in clouds of thick black smoke. The army's space and every square in a 20-foot emanation is choked with burning ash and smog, making all creatures outside the smoke [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] to creatures within it and all creatures within the smoke concealed to creatures outside the smoke and other creatures within it. This smoke lasts for 1 minute, and a creature who enters or begins its turn within the smoke must attempt a Fortitude save or take 2d6 persistent fire damage and become sickened 1 (3d6 persistent fire damage and sickened 2 on a critical failure)\n    *   **Depart** (fire) _Swords of Flame_ The arson demons swing their flaming swords through your enemies' ranks. All enemies in a 10-foot emanation take 4d8 slashing damage and 3d6 fire damage (basic Reflex save). On a critical failure, a creature also takes 2d8 persistent fire damage.\n*   **Devils** Speed 25 feet\n    \n    *   **Arrive** (spirit) _Diabolic Infantry_ A legion of vordines swarm the battlefield. All enemies in a 20-foot emanation take 4d10 piercing damage and 2d6 spirit damage (basic Reflex save) as the vordines impale them with their tridents\n    *   **Depart** (nonlethal) _Whipped and Tripped_ The devils' whips lengthen impossibly to flense flesh from soul. Enemies in two non-intersecting 40-foot lines take 6d8 nonlethal bludgeoning damage (basic Reflex save). On a failure, a creature is also knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]. On a critical failure, it's also knocked prone and [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] for 1 round.\n*   **Divs** Speed 35 feet\n    \n    *   **Arrive** (mental) _Deceptive Delight_ A battalion of sepids arrives to torment your enemies. Enemies in a 60-foot cone take 6d6 mental damage (basic Will save). On a failure, a creature is [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]] for 1 round\n    *   **Depart** (spirit) _Battle Debris_ The sepids slam their falchions into the remnants of the chaos of battle, shattering bones, which explode out in a 30-foot emanation. All non-fiends in the area take 8d6 slashing damage and 3d6 spirit damage from debris (basic Reflex save).\n*   **Qlippoths** Speed 40 feet, climb 40 feet, fly 40 feet\n    \n    *   **Arrive** (visual) _Terrifying Scuttle_ A horde of gongorinans opens their maws to reveal the horror inside. All enemies in a 60-foot cone must succeed at a Will save or be sickened 2 (sickened 2 and [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] for 1 round on a critical failure)\n    *   **Depart** _Pincer Assault_ The gongorinans lash out at everyone. All enemies in a 20-foot emanation take 6d12 slashing damage (basic Reflex save).\n*   **Velstracs** Speed 25 feet\n    \n    *   **Arrive** _Chains of Pain_ A legion of sacristans emerges from the shadows, their barbed chains wrapping around enemy limbs to prevent all escape. Enemies in a 20-foot emanation must attempt a Reflex save. On a failure, they take a –10-foot circumstance penalty to their Speeds and 2d6 persistent bleed damage. On a critical failure they take a –20-foot circumstance penalty to their Speeds and 4d6 persistent bleed damage. This penalty to Speeds lasts until they recover from their persistent bleed damage\n    *   **Depart** _Pleasant Screams_ The sacristans rip their chains from their victims, screaming in unison with their pain. Any enemies who failed the initial Reflex save during the sacristans' arrival take 4d8 piercing damage (basic Fortitude save). In addition, everyone in a 60-foot cone must attempt a Will save. On a failure, they're [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] and [[Conditions/Deafened|Deafened]] for 1 minute ([[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 3]] and deafened for 1 minute on a critical failure); this effect has the auditory, emotion, fear, and mental traits."
