    desc: "You blast the area with grit that scours away soil and gets into creatures' eyes. For the duration of the spell, any plant-based difficult terrain smaller than a tree becomes loose, allowing each 5-foot square of it to be cleared with a single Interact action. In addition, _scouring sand_ attempts to counteract [[Spells/Entangling Flora|Entangling Flora]] and other effects that create or manipulate plant-based terrain in its area. Successfully counteracting an effect removes only the portion of its area that overlaps with _scouring sand's_ area. After one such attempt, the effect is temporarily immune to _scouring sand's_ counteract for 24 hours. Each creature in the area when you Cast this Spell or that ends its turn in the area must attempt a Reflex save.\n* * *\n\n**Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] for 1 minute or until it uses an Interact action to get the sand out of its eyes.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature is also [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] for its next action.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (3rd)** Once per round when you Sustain the Spell, you can move the center of the burst to a spot within range.\n\n**Heightened (6th)** As the 3rd-rank version, except the range is 120 feet and the area is a 20-foot burst."
