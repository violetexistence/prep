    desc: "You conjure hundreds of magical toads to fill the area and hop around. The vast quantity of hopping toads provides enough weight and height for the creatures to trigger any potential trap in the area that could be triggered by the weight, movement, or position of a Medium creature. The area is difficult terrain, and the magic reconstructs any toads destroyed by traps to keep the area full of toads for the duration of the spell."
