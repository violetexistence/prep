    desc: "**Trigger** You or an ally within range attempts a saving throw.\n* * *\n\nYou twist the forces of fate to make a moment dire or uneventful, with no in-between. The target gains a +1 status bonus to the triggering saving throw. If the saving throw's result is a success, it becomes a critical success. If it's a failure, it becomes a critical failure, and the critical failure can't be reduced by abilities that usually reduce critical failure.\n\nIf the triggering ability did not have both a critical success and critical failure condition, _tempt fate_ fails, but you don't expend the Focus Point for Casting this Spell.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Tempt Fate|Spell Effect: Tempt Fate]]\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (8th)** The bonus on the saving throw is +2."
