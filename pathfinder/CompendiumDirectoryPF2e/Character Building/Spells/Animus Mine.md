    desc: "You implant a mental mine within your psyche that detonates against anyone attempting to magically manipulate your thoughts. You can Sustain the spell to suppress the effects of the mine for 1 round to allow someone to safely use a mental effect on you. You can Dismiss the spell. The first creature that uses a magical mental effect against you triggers the animus mine, causing the spell to end. The animus mine deals 4d8 mental damage to the triggering creature, which must attempt a Will save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature takes half damage.\n\n**Failure** The creature takes full damage and is [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]].\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and is stunned 1. You're unaffected by the triggering mental effect.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 2d8."
