    desc: "Vitality radiates outward from you, allowing others to supplicate and receive healing. Once per round, either you or an ally can use an Interact action to supplicate and lay hands upon you to regain Hit Points. Each time the beacon heals someone, it decreases in strength. It restores 4d10 healing vitality Hit Points to the first creature, 4d8 healing vitality Hit Points to the second, 4d6 healing vitality Hit Points to the third, and 4d4 healing vitality Hit Points to the fourth, after which the spell ends. You can have only one vital beacon active at a time.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Vital Beacon|Spell Effect: Vital Beacon]]\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The beacon restores one additional die of Hit Points each time it heals, using the same die size as the others for that step."
