    desc: "You learn the name of the target's exact location (including the building, community, and country) and plane of existence. You can target a creature only if you've seen it in person, have one of its significant belongings, or have a piece of its body, such as a lock of hair. To target an object, you must have touched it or have a fragment of it. _Pinpoint_ automatically overcomes protections against detection of lower rank than this spell, even if they would normally have a chance to block it."
