Make a ranged spell attack roll, dealing 1d8 damage on a success and double damage on a critical success. This spell deals damage according to your elemental influence (for instance, slashing for air or fire for fire) and has your element's trait.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d8."
