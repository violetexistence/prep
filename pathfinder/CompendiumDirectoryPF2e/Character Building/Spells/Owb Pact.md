    desc: "You call upon an owb to assist you in a goal. Only caligni callers can use this ritual with relative safety. If a different type of caligni attempts this ritual, they use an outcome one degree of success worse than the result of their check. If a non-caligni attempts this ritual, the result is an automatic critical failure.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** You conjure the owb. It decides your goals closely match its own and doesn't request a favor in return.\n\n**Success** You conjure the owb. It isn't eager to pursue the task, so it requires a favor in return.\n\n**Failure** You don't conjure an owb.\n\n**Critical Failure** You conjure an owb, but it deems you unworthy and siphons away some of your soul energy. All casters become [[Conditions/Doomed|Doomed 2]]."
