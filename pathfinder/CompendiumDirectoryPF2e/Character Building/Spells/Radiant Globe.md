    desc: "You create a dome of brilliant light that destroys projectiles attempting to pass through it. Ammunition from physical ranged attacks—such as arrows, bolts, sling bullets, and other objects of similar size—is destroyed in a flash of light when it passes into or out of the globe's area. Attackers targeting creatures or objects through the globe's surface with physical ranged attacks must succeed at a Fortitude save or become [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] for 1 round ([[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] for 1 round on a critical failure)."
