    desc: "You share a piece of hidden knowledge with a creature that is both upsetting and intriguing. When you Cast this Spell, choose Arcana, Nature, Occultism, Religion, or Society as the focus of this knowledge. The target must attempt a Will save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The target is [[Conditions/Fascinated|Fascinated]] by the knowledge you shared for 1 round.\n\n**Failure** The target is fascinated by the knowledge for 1 minute. The target can end this fascination early by attempting a skill check to Recall Knowledge to understand the knowledge using the chosen skill (using your spell DC as the DC); regardless of the result, the target becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]], but if they failed the check, they can't reduce their frightened condition below 1 for the remainder of the spell's duration.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 3]] if they attempt to Recall Knowledge."
