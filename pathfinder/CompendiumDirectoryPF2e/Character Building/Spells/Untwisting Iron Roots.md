    desc: "You manipulate the earth beneath your feet to throw your enemies off balance, leaving chunks of rock and rubble behind. Creatures within range take 2d6 bludgeoning damage, with a basic Reflex save; on a failed save, they also fall [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]. The affected area becomes difficult terrain, but you can move through the difficult terrain normally.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d6."
