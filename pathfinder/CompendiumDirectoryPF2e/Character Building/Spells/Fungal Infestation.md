    desc: "Toxic spores swarm over creatures in the area, causing them to erupt in grotesque fungal growths. These noxious growths deal 2d6 persistent poison damage, and each creature must attempt a Fortitude save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The target takes half the persistent poison damage.\n\n**Failure** The target takes the full persistent poison damage. While it's taking this persistent poison damage, it has weakness 1 to fire and weakness 1 to slashing.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but double the persistent poison damage. While it's taking this persistent poison damage, it has weakness 2 to fire and weakness 2 to slashing.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Fungal Infestation|Spell Effect: Fungal Infestation]]\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+2)** The persistent damage increases by 2d6, and the weakness increases by 1, or by 2 on a critical failure."
