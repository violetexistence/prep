    desc: "You grant the target's body and gear aspects of sand. The target gains resistance 5 to piercing and slashing damage, has no scent, and can't bleed. In sandy terrain, even when out in the open, the target has enough concealment to attempt to Hide. Each time the target takes damage to which _sand form_ grants resistance, reduce the duration of the spell by 1 minute.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Sand Form|Spell Effect: Sand Form]]\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (5th)** The resistance is 10.\n\n**Heightened (7th)** The resistance is 15."
