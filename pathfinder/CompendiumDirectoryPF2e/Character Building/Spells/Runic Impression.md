If you cast runic impression on a weapon, this spell ends if you cease holding the weapon, with the exception of throwing a _returning_ weapon. If this spell would give a weapon more property runes than its normal maximum, one of the existing property runes (you choose) is suppressed until the spell ends. For unarmed attacks, if this spell would give you more property runes than you could have from _handwraps of mighty blows_, one of the existing property runes is similarly suppressed.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (8th)** Add keen to the list of runes you can choose as well as the greater types of [[Equipment/Corrosive (Greater)|Corrosive]], [[Equipment/Flaming (Greater)|Flaming]], [[Equipment/Frost (Greater)|Frost]], [[Equipment/Shock (Greater)|Shock]], and [[Equipment/Thundering (Greater)|Thundering]].\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Runic Impression|Spell Effect: Runic Impression]]"
