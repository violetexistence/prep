    desc: "Your patron temporarily links your vision with that of another, causing both of you to be able to see through each other's eyes. For the duration of the hex, the two of you share any vision-based senses (such as darkvision or low-light vision) and gain a +2 status bonus to Perception checks, but if either of you are [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] or [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]], you both are.\n\nIf you cast share vision while a previous casting of this hex is still in effect, the previous effect ends.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Share Vision|Spell Effect: Share Vision]]"
