    desc: "You shout a command that's hard to ignore. You can command the target to approach you, run away (as if it had the [[Conditions/Fleeing|Fleeing]] condition), release what it's holding, drop [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]], or stand in place. It can't [[Actions/Delay|Delay]] or take any reactions until it has obeyed your command. The effects depend on the target's Will save.\n* * *\n\n**Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Failure** For the first action on its next turn, the creature must use a single action to do as you command.\n\n**Critical Failure** The target must use all its actions on its next turn to obey your command.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (5th)** You can target up to 10 creatures."
