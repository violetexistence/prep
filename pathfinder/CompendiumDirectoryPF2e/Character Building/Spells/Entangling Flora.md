Each round that a creature starts its turn in the area, it must attempt a Reflex save. On a failure, it takes a â€“10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds until it leaves the area, and on a critical failure, it's also [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] for 1 round. Creatures can attempt to [[Actions/Escape|Escape]] to remove these effects.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Entangling Flora|Spell Effect: Entangling Flora]]"
