    desc: "You use your knowledge of nature to pass the target off as a common animal of the same size, representing a species chosen when the spell is cast. This covers the target's visual appearance, scent, and voice. The target can communicate with other members of the species as though they shared a language but can't speak other languages while the spell persists.\n\nCasting _imitate fauna_ counts as setting up a disguise for the purpose of the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] action. It allows the target to ignore any circumstance penalties they might take for being disguised as dissimilar creatures, and it gives the target a +4 status bonus to Deception checks to prevent other animals from seeing through their disguise. You can Dismiss this spell.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Imitate Fauna|Spell Effect: Imitate Fauna]]\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (5th)** You can target up to six willing animals."
