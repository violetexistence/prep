    desc: "**Requirements** You can bleed.\n\n**Trigger** A creature deals piercing, slashing, or persistent bleed damage to you.\n* * *\n\nYou curse the target, punishing it for having the audacity to spill your blood. The target takes 2d6 persistent bleed damage and must attempt a Will save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The target takes half the persistent bleed damage.\n\n**Failure** The target takes the full persistent bleed damage. Until the bleeding stops, the target has weakness 1 to piercing and slashing damage. [[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Blood Vendetta (Failure)|Spell Effect: Blood Vendetta (Failure)]]\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target takes double the persistent bleed damage.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+2)** The persistent bleed damage increases by 2d6."
