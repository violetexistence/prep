Each creature in the area must attempt a Reflex save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature takes half damage.\n\n**Failure** The creature takes full damage.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature takes full damage and becomes [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] permanently.\n\nIf the globe overlaps with an area of magical darkness, _sunburst_ attempts to counteract the darkness effect.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The fire damage increases by 1d10, and the vitality damage against undead increases by 1d10."
