    desc: "A long tentacle like that belonging to an octopus, anemone, or man-of-war, dripping with briny water, appears from a glowing blue portal to wrap around the target's face, blocking its vision. For the duration of the spell, the target must attempt a Fortitude save at the beginning of its turn. The portal follows the target around, and the tentacle can't be targeted or harmed.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The target takes a â€“2 penalty to Perception checks involving vision until the end of its turn. [[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Sting of the Sea|Spell Effect: Sting of the Sea]]\n\n**Failure** The target is [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] until the end of its turn.\n\n**Critical Failure** The target is [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] until the end of its turn."
