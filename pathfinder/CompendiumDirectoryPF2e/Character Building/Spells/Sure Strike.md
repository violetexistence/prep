    desc: "The next time you make an attack roll before the end of your turn, roll it twice and use the better result. The attack ignores circumstance penalties to the attack roll and any flat check required due to the target being [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] or [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]]. You are then temporarily immune to _sure strike_ for 10 minutes.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Sure Strike|Spell Effect: Sure Strike]]"
