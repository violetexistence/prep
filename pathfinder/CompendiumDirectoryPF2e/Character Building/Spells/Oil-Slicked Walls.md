    desc: "The outer walls are a city's first defense against invaders, and you want to make certain no attackers can climb over them. Upon successful completion of this ritual, the surfaces of a settlement's walls within the area are covered with a thin, slippery sheen that can't be washed away.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The oil covering the walls also coats any climber's hands. The DC for Athletics checks to Climb the affected walls increases by 10, and a creature who fails a check to climb also drops anything they are carrying.\n\n**Success** The DC for Athletics checks to Climb the affected walls increases by 5.\n\n**Failure** The ritual has no effect.\n\n**Critical Failure** Phantom oil constantly pools around your feet during times of stress. For 1 week, the first time each encounter that a primary or secondary caster takes an action to move, they must attempt a Reflex save or Acrobatics check to [[Actions/Balance|Balance]] against the ritual's casting DC or fall [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]. A caster can Step or [[Actions/Crawl|Crawl]] without having to attempt a check or save."
