    desc: "You reanimate the corpse of a fallen creature as an undead minion under your control. The reanimated creature is an undead skeleton or zombie. Choose a skeleton or zombie stat block of the same size as the original creature and of a level no higher than the creature's original level. The shambling horror keeps Speeds it had in life, as well as melee Strikes that deal only physical damage. These attacks use the highest attack modifier from the skeleton or zombie you choose. Some of the skeleton's or zombie's abilities might not make sense for the shambling horror, and some abilities the creature had in life might not persist in undeath; the GM makes the final choice of what abilities the horror has.\n\nA shambling horror has the minion trait. You can't control more than one shambling horror at the same time-if you create a new one while one is already under your control, you must choose one to release, causing it to lose the minion trait. Shambling horrors that have been released expire when the spell duration does. After the duration expires, you can cast shambling horror again on the same corpse to animate it once more. However, after the next sunrise, you can no longer animate the corpse as a shambling horror.\n\n## Undead Skeletons\n\n  \n\n| Level | Size | Creature Name |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| -1 | Medium | [[Monster Core/Skeleton Guard\\|Skeleton Guard]] |\n| 0 | Medium | Wolf Skeleton |\n| 1 | Medium | Skeletal Soldier |\n| 2 | Medium | [[Monster Core/Skeletal Champion\\|Skeletal Champion]] |\n| 2 | Large | [[Monster Core/Skeletal Horse\\|Skeletal Horse]] |\n| 3 | Large | [[Monster Core/Skeletal Giant\\|Skeletal Giant]] |\n| 5 | Medium | [[Bestiary 3/Harpy Skeleton\\|Harpy Skeleton]] |\n| 5 | Medium | Skeletal Mage |\n| 6 | Large | Beetle Carapace |\n| 7 | Huge | [[Monster Core/Skeletal Hulk\\|Skeletal Hulk]] |\n| 8 | Large | Drake Skeleton |\n| 9 | Gargantuan | [[Bestiary 3/Tyrannosaurus Skeleton\\|Tyrannosaurus Skeleton]] |\n| 11 | Gargantuan | [[Bestiary 3/Skeleton Infantry\\|Skeleton Infantry]] |\n| 13 | Gargantuan | Skeletal Titan |\n\n## Zombies\n\n  \n\n| Level | Size | Creature Name |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| -1 | Medium | [[Monster Core/Zombie Shambler\\|Zombie Shambler]] |\n| 0 | Medium | Zombie Snake |\n| 1 | Medium | [[Monster Core/Plague Zombie\\|Plague Zombie]] |\n| 2 | Medium | Husk Zombie |\n| 2 | Large | [[Monster Core/Zombie Brute\\|Zombie Brute]] |\n| 3 | Large | Zombie Owlbear |\n| 4 | Gargantuan | [[Bestiary 3/Shambler Troop\\|Shambler Troop]] |\n| 4 | Medium | Zombie Lord |\n| 5 | Medium | Withered |\n| 6 | Medium | [[Bestiary 3/Sulfur Zombie\\|Sulfur Zombie]] |\n| 6 | Huge | [[Monster Core/Zombie Hulk\\|Zombie Hulk]] |\n| 9 | Huge | [[Bestiary 3/Zombie Dragon\\|Zombie Dragon]] |\n| 11 | Huge | Zombie Mammoth |"
