    desc: "While in a crowd of roughly similar creatures, your appearance becomes bland and nondescript. You gain a +2 status bonus to Deception and Stealth checks to go incognito among the crowd, and you ignore difficult terrain caused by the crowd. This counts as setting up a disguise for the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] use of Deception and you add your level even if you're untrained.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Face in the Crowd|Spell Effect: Face in the Crowd]]\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (3rd)** The spell gains a range of 10 feet and can target up to 10 creatures."
