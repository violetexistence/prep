    desc: "Make a melee unarmed Strike. If you hit and the target is alive, anytime during the duration, you can spend a single action, which has the auditory and concentrate traits, to speak a word of death that could instantly slay it. The target must attempt a Fortitude save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target survives, the spell ends, and the target is then temporarily immune for 24 hours.\n\n**Success** The target is [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]] and takes 40 damage, the spell ends, and the target is then temporarily immune for 24 hours.\n\n**Failure** The target is [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 3]] and takes 80 damage. The spell's duration continues, but the target is then temporarily immune for 24 hours against being killed by touch of death.\n\n**Critical Failure** The target dies.\n\nIf you cast touch of death again, the effects of any _touch of death_ you had previously cast end.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 10 on a failure, or 5 on a success."
