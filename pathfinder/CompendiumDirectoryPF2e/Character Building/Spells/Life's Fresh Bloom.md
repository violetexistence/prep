    desc: "The ground around you blooms with life, sprouting sparkling grass, flowers, and small shrubs. Each living and non-nindoru creature that starts its turn standing on the ground in the area recovers 1d6 Hit Points and gains a +5-foot status bonus to its Speed until the end of its next turn. Nindoru fiends and undead that start their turn in the area of life's fresh bloom instead become [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] unless they succeed at a Fortitude saving throw.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Life's Fresh Bloom|Spell Effect: Life's Fresh Bloom]]\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (7th)** Increase the Hit Points restored to 1d8 and [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]].\n\n**Heightened (10th)** Increase the Hit Points restored to 1d10 and [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 3]]."
