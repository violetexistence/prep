    desc: "You transcend your physical form, becoming a beacon of healing energy. Your body exudes bright light like a torch. You gain resistance 5 to precision damage and weakness 5 to void damage, and your unarmed Strikes deal an extra 1d4 vitality damage. You can touch a living creature with an Interact action to restore 6d8 healing vitality Hit Points to it, and when a creature touches you with an Interact action you can allow it to gain the same healing; either way, the creature becomes temporarily immune to life-giving form's healing for 1 minute. This is a vitality healing effect. You can't heal yourself with life-giving form. A creature harmed by vitality damage (such as an undead) that touches you or damages you with an unarmed attack or non-reach melee weapon instead takes 3d4 + (6 - 6 vitality damage, and it doesn't become temporarily immune. You can Dismiss this spell.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Life-Giving Form|Spell Effect: Life-Giving Form]]\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The Hit Points restored with an Interact action increases by 1d8, the vitality damage increases by 1, and the resistance and weakness increases by 1"
