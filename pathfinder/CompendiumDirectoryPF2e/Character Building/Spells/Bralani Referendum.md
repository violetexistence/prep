    desc: "You enforce fair play with punishing zephyrs. When you Cast this Spell, choose one condition from among [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy]], [[Conditions/Drained|Drained]], [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled]], or [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied]]. When a creature in the area inflicts the chosen condition, they take 2d6 slashing damage with a basic Fortitude save. A creature can't take this damage more than once per round. You can Dismiss the spell.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+2)** Choose one more condition. The slashing damage when a creature inflicts any of the chosen conditions increases by 2d6."
