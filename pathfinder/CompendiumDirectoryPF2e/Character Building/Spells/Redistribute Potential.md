    desc: "**Area** two adjacent 5-foot squares\n* * *\n\nEnergy attempts to balance out, but with your magic, you can shunt all the energy in one area to another. Creatures in either area take 4d4 damage with a basic Fortitude save. Choose one of the squares to steal heat, dealing cold damage, and the other to concentrate the stolen heat, dealing fire damage. A creature that fails its save also becomes [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] from numbness if it's in the area of stolen heat or [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]] from heat stroke if it's in the area of concentrated heat; these conditions last until the start of your next turn. If a creature is large enough to be in both squares, you choose only one of the areas for it to attempt its save against; it's unaffected by the other area.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d4."
