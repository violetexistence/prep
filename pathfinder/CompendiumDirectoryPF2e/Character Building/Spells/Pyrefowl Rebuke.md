    desc: "**Trigger** A creature within 10 feet of you Strikes and deals damage to you.\n* * *\n\nFiery wings briefly envelop your arms, and with a swift wingbeat, you flutter away from your attacker in a shower of searing sparks. You deal 1d6 fire damage to the triggering creature, with a basic Reflex save, and Fly up to 10 feet in a straight line directly away from it. If the creature critically fails its saving throw, your movement does not provoke reactions from it, and it's [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] until the end of its next turn.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+2)** The damage increases by 1d6, and the maximum distance you can Fly increases by 5 feet."
