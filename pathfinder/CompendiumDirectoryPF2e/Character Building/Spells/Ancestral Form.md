You gain resistance 10 to all damage (except force, spirit and damage from Strikes with the [[Equipment/Ghost Touch|Ghost Touch]] property rune), and this resistance is doubled against non-magical and precision damage.\n\nYou gain a fly Speed equal to your land Speed; when [[Actions/Fly|Flying]], moving upward isn't difficult terrain for you. You can't move through solid objects, but you can float through tiny gaps.\n\nYou can't Cast Spells (but you can [[Actions/Sustain|Sustain Spells]]), activate items, or use actions that have the attack or manipulate trait.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+2)** The resistance increases by 5.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Ancestral Form|Spell Effect: Ancestral Form]]"
