For 1 minute, the first time per round that the target gains [[Conditions/Persistent Damage|Persistent Bleed Damage]], they immediately take that amount of slashing damage as the mantis claws grow off the symbol and rake them.\n\n**Failure** As success, but the curse has an unlimited duration.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the DC on the target's flat check to remove persistent bleed damage increases to 20 (15 with particularly effective assistance)."
