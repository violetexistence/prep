    desc: "The next damaging or healing spell the target casts before the start of your next turn deals damage or restores Hit Points as if the spell were heightened 1 rank higher than its actual rank. This applies only to initial healing or damage when the spell is cast, not any ongoing effects. The spell otherwise functions at its actual rank. Once the target casts the spell, _mystic beacon_ ends."
