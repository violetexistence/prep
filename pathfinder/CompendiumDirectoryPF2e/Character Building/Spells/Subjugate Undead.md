    desc: "You attempt to seize control of the target. It can attempt a Will save to resist the effect. If the target is already being controlled by another creature, the controlling creature also rolls a saving throw and the undead uses the better result. Casting subjugate undead again ends any previous subjugate undead you cast.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected and is temporarily immune for 24 hours.\n\n**Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Failure** The undead creature becomes a minion under your control for 1 minute. The spell is dismissed if you or an ally takes a hostile action against the minion undead.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, except the duration is 10 minutes."
