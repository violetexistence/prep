    desc: "A scimitar-shaped beam of fiery light springs from your free hand. While the spell lasts, you can use a single action, which has the attack and concentrate traits, to burn your foes with the _blazing blade_. When you do, make a spell attack roll. On a success, the _blazing blade_ deals 1d6 fire damage plus 1d6 spirit damage plus your spellcasting ability modifier. On a critical success, it deals double the usual damage.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (4th)** The blade's fire damage increases to 2d6. On a critical success, the target takes 1d6 persistent spirit damage.\n\n**Heightened (6th)** The blade's fire damage increases to 3d6. On a critical success, the target takes 2d6 persistent spirit damage.\n\n**Heightened (8th)** The blade's fire damage increases to 4d6. On a critical success, the target takes 3d6 persistent spirit damage."
