    desc: "**Trigger** A creature in range Strides\n* * *\n\nYou surround a moving creature with lifelike illusions, shifting their perception of the terrain to subtly lead them off course. The target must attempt a Will save. Regardless of the result, the creature is immune to lose the path for 1 hour.\n* * *\n\n**Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Failure** The creature treats all squares as difficult terrain for its Stride.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, except that you determine where the target moves during the Stride, though you can't move it into hazardous terrain or to a place it can't stand."
