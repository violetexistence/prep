    desc: "**Trigger** You cast a darkness or shadow spell.\n* * *\n\nYou magnify the darkness from the triggering effect, causing the ambient light level to flicker briefly so you can slip from sight. You can immediately attempt a Stealth check to [[Actions/Hide|Hide]], and you can become [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] to a creature even if you don't have cover and aren't otherwise concealed from that creature. You cease being hidden at the end of your turn unless you move into cover or become [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] before then."
