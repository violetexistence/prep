    desc: "You tap into the zeitgeist of any settlements in range. You learn the names of the settlements. On all Lore checks to Recall Knowledge about those settlements or to Gather Information in or about those settlements, you gain a +2 status bonus and use your level as your proficiency bonus even if you're untrained. When you Cast the Spell, you can immediately Recall Knowledge about one of the settlements using its Lore skill (such as Absalom Lore), which benefits from the bonus. If you cast pulse of civilization again, any previous casting ends.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (5th)** The range is 100 miles.\n\n**Heightened (7th)** The range is 500 miles and the bonus is +3"
