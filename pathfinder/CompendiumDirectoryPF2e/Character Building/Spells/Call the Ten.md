    desc: "The Ten Magic Warriors were the first of the Magaambya's students, and they come to your aid even now. An indistinct spirit appears near each target, each wearing a different mask of the Ten Magic Warriors. The spirits then either strike their designated targets with magical energy, dealing each one 4d6 spirit damage with a basic Fortitude save, or shield them, granting their target resistance 3 to physical and spirit damage until the beginning of your next turn. You designate which targets are attacked and which are shielded.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Call the Ten|Spell Effect: Call the Ten]]\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+2)** The amount of damage increases by 1d6 and the amount of resistance increases by 2."
