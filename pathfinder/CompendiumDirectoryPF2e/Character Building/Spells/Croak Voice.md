    desc: "You cause the target creature's vocal chords to swell like those of a frog. The target must attempt a Fortitude save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The target's voice becomes hoarse, and speaking becomes painful. Whenever it uses an action that has the auditory trait or attempts to Cast a Spell that doesn't have the subtle trait, it must succeed at a `DC 5 Flat check` or the action is lost. Once per round, the target can spend an Interact action to massage its throat, attempting a Fortitude save against your spell DC. On a success, the spell ends.\n\n**Failure** As success, but using an action with the auditory trait also deals 2d10 mental damage to the target as the sound of its distorted voice grates on its ears.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the damage for using an action with the auditory trait is doubled, and the target can't use an Interact action to attempt a Fortitude save to end the effect early.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The damage for using an action with the auditory trait increases by 1d10."
