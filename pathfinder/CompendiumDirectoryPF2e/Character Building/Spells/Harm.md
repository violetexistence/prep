    desc: "You channel void energy to harm the living or heal the undead. If the target is a living creature, you deal 1d8 void damage to it, and it gets a basic Fortitude save. If the target is a willing undead creature, you restore that amount of Hit Points. The number of actions you spend when Casting this Spell determines its targets, range, area, and other parameters.\n\n`pf2:1` The spell has a range of touch.\n\n`pf2:2` **(concentrate)** The spell has a range of 30 feet. If you're healing an undead creature, increase the Hit Points restored by 8.\n\n`pf2:3` **(concentrate)** You disperse void energy in a 30-foot emanation. This targets all living and undead creatures in the area.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The amount of healing or damage increases by 1d8, and the extra healing for the 2-action version increases by 8."
