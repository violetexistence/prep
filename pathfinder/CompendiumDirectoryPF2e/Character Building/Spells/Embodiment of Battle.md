    desc: "Your apparition guides your attacks and imparts its skill to your movements. For the duration, your proficiency with martial weapons is equal to your proficiency with simple weapons, you gain a +1 status bonus to attack and damage rolls made with weapons or unarmed attacks, and you gain the [[Actions/Reactive Strike|Reactive Strike]] reaction; this reaction gains the apparition trait. The instincts of an apparition of battle run contrary to the use of magic; for the duration of this spell, you take a â€“2 status penalty to your spell attack modifiers and your spell DCs.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Embodiment of Battle|Spell Effect: Embodiment of Battle]]\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (4th)** The status bonus to attack and damage rolls granted by this spell is increased to +2.\n\n**Heightened (7th)** The status bonus to attack and damage rolls granted by this spell is increased to +3."
