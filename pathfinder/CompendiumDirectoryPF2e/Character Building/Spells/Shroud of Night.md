    desc: "Your patron blankets the target's eyes in darkness. If you cast this hex on a willing ally (for instance, one with light blindness), the ally can choose which result it gets without rolling.\n* * *\n\n**Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Failure** The target is shrouded in murky darkness. It treats bright light as dim light, and unless it has greater darkvision, all creatures are [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] to it."
