    desc: "You condemn your targets to violent misfortune. At the GM's discretion, you can target a group of individuals within range who serve the same cause, such as a nation's army, or who have a shared identity, such as members of a single faith. You can also choose to target a settlement that's a village or town, or a neighborhood community within a larger settlement.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** As success, and the targets experience extreme accidents that threaten life, limb, or other loss. The GM adjudicates these occurrences on a case-by-case basis, but in general, the population experiences a disturbing rise in unfortunate casualties.\n\n**Success** The targets experience misfortune during even routine tasks that result in minor injuries. This bad luck increases when you're close; the first time each round a target within 15 feet of you attempts an attack roll or skill check, they must roll twice and use the worse result.\n\n**Failure** The ritual has no effect.\n\n**Critical Failure** You unwittingly curse yourself. For the next 24 hours, each caster must roll all attack rolls and skill checks twice and use the worse result."
