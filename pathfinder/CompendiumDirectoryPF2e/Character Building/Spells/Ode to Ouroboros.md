    desc: "**Trigger** A creature's dying condition would reach the value at which they would die.\n* * *\n\nYour ode staves off death. The target's dying condition remains 1 below the value at which it dies. This doesn't help prevent death from effects that kill the target without increasing its dying condition, such as [[Spells/Disintegrate|Disintegrate]] and death effects."
