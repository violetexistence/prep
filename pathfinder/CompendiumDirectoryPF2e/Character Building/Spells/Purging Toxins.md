    desc: "In the right dose, a scourge can become a cure. Deal poison damage equal to the spell's rank to the target, then attempt a counteract check against one disease or poison afflicting the target. The target is then temporarily immune for 24 hours. If the target is immune to poison, this spell has no effect.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (5th)** You can attempt counteract checks against any number of poisons or diseases afflicting the target."
