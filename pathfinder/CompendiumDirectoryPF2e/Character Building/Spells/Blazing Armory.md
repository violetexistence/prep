    desc: "As long as you have magic, you're never unarmed. You materialize a flaming simulacrum of any common simple or martial weapon into the target's grasp. The target must have a free hand to hold the weapon, or else the weapon falls to the ground in the target's space. The blazing weapon functions as a _+1 striking weapon_, and its damage type changes to fire. The damage type can't be changed using the versatile trait, modular trait, or similar methods.\n\nA thrown weapon rematerializes in the target's hand after the Strike is complete. If you choose a ranged weapon that uses ammunition, the wielder must still reload the weapon using the normal number of actions, though this generates ammunition automatically; this functions as normal ammunition, and the blazing weapon can't use other types of ammunition.\n\nAny creature other than you or the target that attempts to touch, make a Strike with, or [[Actions/Disarm|Disarm]] the weapon takes 1d6 fire damage each time.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (4th)** You can target up to 5 willing creatures and can choose a different weapon for each target. The weapons function as _+1 striking flaming_ weapons.\n\n**Heightened (6th)** As 4th, but the weapons function as _+2 greater striking flaming_ weapons.\n\n**Heightened (8th)** As 4th, but the weapons function as _+3 greater striking greater flaming_ weapons.\n\n**Heightened (10th)** As 4th, but the weapons function as _+3 major striking greater flaming_ weapons."
