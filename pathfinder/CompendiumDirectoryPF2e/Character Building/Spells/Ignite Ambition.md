    desc: "**Trigger** You or an ally in range attempt to use a mental effect to convince a creature to do something (such as a [[Actions/Coerce|Coerce]], [[Actions/Request|Request]], or a [[Spells/Suggestion|Suggestion]] spell).\n* * *\n\nYou strengthen a target's ambition, increase its resentment of allies, and make its allegiances more susceptible to change. The target must attempt a Will save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected and realized you attempted to influence its reaction with magic.\n\n**Success** The target takes a -1 status penalty to its defenses against the triggering effect. This penalty is -2 if the target is being encouraged to advance its own ambitions.The target doesn't realize you Cast the Spell on it.\n\n**Failure** As success, but the penalty is -4 if the target is being encouraged to advance its own ambitions.\n\n**Critical Failure** As success, but the creature automatically follows a suggestion that advances its own ambitions."
