    desc: "You launch a curved length of wood at a foe that arcs around objects and obstacles to strike from an unexpected direction. Make a spell attack roll against the target's AC. This attack ignores the target's [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] condition and ignores all cover except greater cover. If you hit, the projectile deals 7d10 bludgeoning damage.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (7th)** The damage increases to 9d10.\n\n**Heightened (9th)** The damage increases to 12d10, and the attack ignores cover completely."
