    desc: "You open a miniature portal to an elemental plane within your mouth, then exhale a powerful explosion of the plane's element. Roll 1d6 to determine the element. If you used 3 actions to Cast this Spell, you can choose the element instead. This spell gains the trait matching the element.\n\nEach creature in the cone must attempt a basic Reflex save.\n\n1.  **Air** Strong winds and lightning strikes buffet creatures in the cone, dealing 6d10 electricity damage. A creature that fails its save is also pushed 10 feet.\n2.  **Earth** A cone of mud deals 5d10 bludgeoning damage to creatures in the area. A creature on the ground that fails its save slips and falls [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]].\n3.  **Fire** A surging cone of fire deals 7d10 fire damage.\n4.  **Metal** A cone of rust slices flesh and damages metal. Each creature in the area takes 5d10 slashing damage. A creature made of metal gets a result one degree of success worse than it rolled, and an unattended metal object gets a critical failure.\n5.  **Water** A torrent of chilled water deals 3d10 cold damage and 3d10 bludgeoning damage.\n6.  **Wood** Branches rip through creatures, dealing 3d10 piercing damage and 3d10 slashing damage. Ground in the area becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d10. For water and wood, you can choose which damage type increases for each rank the spell is heightened."
