    desc: "You utter the most powerful arcane word of power. Once targeted, the target is then temporarily immune for 10 minutes. The effect of the spell depends on the target's level.\n\n*   **14th or Lower** The target dies instantly.\n*   **15th** If the target has 50 Hit Points or fewer, it dies instantly; otherwise, it drops to 0 Hit Points and becomes [[Conditions/Dying|Dying 1]], or increases its Dying condition by 1 if it's already Dying.\n*   **16th or Higher** The target takes 50 damage; if this brings the target to 0 Hit Points, the target dies instantly.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (10th)** The levels at which each outcome applies increase by 2."
