    desc: "With a twist of a finger, you send a creature careening on a haphazard trajectory. The target must attempt a Reflex save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The target takes a -2 status penalty to Athletics and Acrobatics checks.\n\n**Failure** As success, and each time the target Strides, it uses the first 5 feet of movement of the Stride to move 5 feet in a random direction (this is forced movement). This has no effect on a creature with only 5 feet of movement.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, except you control the direction of the target's first 5 feet of movement of the Stride.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Stumbling Curse|Spell Effect: Stumbling Curse]]"
