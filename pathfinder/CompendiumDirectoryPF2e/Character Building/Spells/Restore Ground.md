    desc: "You sense that this place yearns to throw off the shackles of civilization. You attempt to restore the area within the burst to a natural state, removing all artificial objects and buildings and encouraging the growth of plants on the ground that remains. Creatures are unaffected unless caught in a structural collapse.\n\n*   **Ground** All ground within the area becomes greater difficult terrain for 1 round.\n*   **Objects** Any unattended object of Bulk 4 or less is destroyed, regardless of Hardness, unless it's an artifact or similarly hard to destroy.\n*   **Plants** Plants in the area become healthier and more fruitful for 1 year.\n*   **Structures** Structures within range are shaken and may collapse, as if affected by [[Spells/Earthquake|Earthquake]]."
