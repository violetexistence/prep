    desc: "You create a visible magical barrier that attempts to counteract teleportation effects and planar travel into or out of the area, including items that allow access to extradimensional spaces. _Planar seal_ tries to counteract any attempt to summon a creature into the area but doesn't stop the creature from departing when the summoning ends."
