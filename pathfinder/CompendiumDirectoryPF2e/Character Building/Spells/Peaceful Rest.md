    desc: "The targeted corpse doesn't decay, nor can it be transformed into an undead. If the corpse is subject to a spell that requires the corpse to have died within a certain amount of time (for example, [[Spells/Raise Dead|Raise Dead]]), do not count the duration of _peaceful rest_ against that time. This spell also prevents ordinary bugs and pests (such as maggots) from consuming the body.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (5th)** The spell's duration is unlimited, but the spell takes one more action to cast and requires a cost (embalming fluid worth 6 gp)."
