    desc: "You suppress your choice of one of the following conditions that's affecting the target: [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy]], [[Conditions/Encumbered|Encumbered]], [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled]], or [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]]. The duration of the condition doesn't elapse while it is suppressed, so if you don't remove the effect that caused the condition, the condition returns after the spell's duration expires."
