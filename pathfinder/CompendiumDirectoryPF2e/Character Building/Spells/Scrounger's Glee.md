    desc: "With a cruel laugh and a flash of your canines, you make a target understand that death is coming to claim it and that its demise will serve to strengthen another. The target becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]] if it fails a Will save (or [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] on a critical failure). This condition can't be reduced below 1 while the spell is active and the target can hear you. You can Dismiss the spell as a reaction when an ally critically succeeds at a Strike against the target, restoring 1d4 healing Hit Points to that ally.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+2)** The number of Hit Points restored when you Dismiss the spell increases by 1d4."
