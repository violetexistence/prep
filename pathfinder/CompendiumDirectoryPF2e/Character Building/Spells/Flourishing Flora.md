On a critical failure, targets experience additional effects, also depending on what you choose to grow. The type of plant and its effects are chosen when you Cast the Spell.\n\n*   **Cacti** Piercing damage, and 1 bleed damage on a critical failure.\n*   **Flowers** Poison damage, and [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] for 2 rounds on a critical failure.\n*   **Fruits** Bludgeoning damage, and [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] for 2 rounds on a critical failure.\n*   **Roots** Bludgeoning damage, and the affected creatures fall [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] on a critical failure.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d4, and the persistent bleed damage from cacti increases by 1."
