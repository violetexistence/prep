    desc: "With a cursory mental touch, you attempt to read the target's mind. It must attempt a Will save. The target then becomes temporarily immune to your mind reading for 1 hour.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target perceives vague surface thoughts from you when you Cast the Spell.\n\n**Success** You find out whether the target's Intelligence modifier is higher than, equal to, or lower than yours.\n\n**Failure** You perceive vague surface thoughts from the target when you Cast the Spell, and you find out whether its Intelligence is higher than, equal to, or lower than yours.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, and for the duration of the spell, you can Sustain the spell to detect the target's surface thoughts again. The target doesn't receive any additional saves."
