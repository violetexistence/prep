    desc: "You give an unsettling, warbling cry that causes nearby creatures to lash out without control. Each creature in the area that can hear must attempt a Will save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected and immune to this spell for 1 minute.\n\n**Success** The target is [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]].\n\n**Failure** The target is [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]] for 1 minute. It can attempt a new save at the end of each of its turns to end the confusion.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, and the creature immediately attacks itself. This Strike doesn't give the creature a flat check to recover from the confusion."
