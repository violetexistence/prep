This counts as two attacks for your multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until you've made both attacks. On a hit, the creatures takes 1d8 slashing plus 1d4 additional damage of a type determined by the magical tradition related to the dragon that influenced your bloodline: **arcane** force, **divine** spirit, **occult** mental, or **primal** fire.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The initial damage increases by 1d8 and the additional damage increases by 1d4."
