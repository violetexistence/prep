    desc: "The sun rises on a gathering of heroes bonded to a cause. While only one secondary caster can attempt the secondary check, each secondary caster must also spend 1 Mythic Point upon successful completion of the ritual (see below). A secondary caster who chooses not to spend the Mythic Point can't benefit from the ritual's effects.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** As success, but the first time a caster gains the [[Conditions/Doomed|Doomed]], [[Conditions/Dying|Dying]], or [[Conditions/Wounded|Wounded]] condition during the ritual's duration, reduce the value of that condition by 1 (minimum 0).\n\n**Success** Each secondary caster must spend 1 Mythic Point. For the duration of the ritual, when a caster [[Actions/Aid|Aids]] another caster, they can attempt the associated check at mythic proficiency. On a success, the circumstance bonus the Aiding caster grants is increased to +2, and on a critical success, the circumstance bonus is increased to +5.\n\n**Failure** The ritual has no effect. The secondary casters don't need to each spend 1 Mythic Point.\n\n**Critical Failure** The ritual fails, and the casters rupture their own connections to their mythic destinies. None of the casters can gain Mythic Points for 1 week."
