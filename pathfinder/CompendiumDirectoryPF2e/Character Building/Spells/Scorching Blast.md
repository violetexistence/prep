    desc: "You evoke a mass of fire into the air around your outstretched fist. For the remainder of your turn, you can blast targets within 30 feet with this fire by spending a single action which has the attack and concentrate traits. When you do so, attempt a ranged spell attack roll. If you hit, you inflict 2d8 fire damage. On a critical hit, the target takes 1d6+((1 -1)*2 persistent fire damage.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The base damage increases by 1d8 and the persistent fire damage on a critical hit increases by 2."
