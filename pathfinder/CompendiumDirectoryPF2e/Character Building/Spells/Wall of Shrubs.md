    desc: "You call forth a line of bushes native to the region to spring from the ground. The wall of shrubs stands in a line 60 feet long, is less than 5 feet tall, and is a foot thick, providing lesser cover.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (3rd)** The shrubs are 10 feet tall and 5 feet thick, provide standard cover, are difficult terrain, and have a Climb DC of 15. The duration increases to 10 minutes.\n\n**Heightened (5th)** As 3rd rank, but the shrubs provide greater cover and the duration is 1 hour. You can choose to form a ring of shrubs with a diameter of up to 30 feet instead of a line."
