It explodes in an enormous burst that deals 3d6 bludgeoning damage to creatures in the area from the cascade of water. The water deals an additional 6d6 spirit damage to creatures with the unholy trait in the area.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The bludgeoning damage increases by 1d6, and the additional spirit damage increases by 2d6."
