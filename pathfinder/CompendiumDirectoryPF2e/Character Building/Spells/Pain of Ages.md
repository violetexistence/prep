    desc: "You sense a spiritual resonance of deep anguish in the earth beneath your feet, the walls surrounding you, or the fragments of souls left behind in a place of calamity. You draw on this reservoir of pain and unleash its force against your enemies, dealing 8d8 spirit damage. On a critical failure, the creature is also [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned]] for 1 round as it reels from the impact of so much anguish.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 2d8."
