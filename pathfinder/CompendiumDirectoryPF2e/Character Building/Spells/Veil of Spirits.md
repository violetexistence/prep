    desc: "You draw on the essence of spiritual energy surrounding you to manifest a misty veil. When a creature that isn't immune to spirit damage begins its turn within the area, it must attempt a Reflex save. You can Dismiss the veil.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature is [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] until the beginning of its next turn.\n\n**Failure** The creature is dazzled and gains a weakness to spirit damage equal to half your level until the beginning of its next turn as spiritual energy clings to it. A creature with spiritsense can't use that imprecise sense while it's dazzled in this way.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the weakness is equal to your level.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Veil of Spirits|Spell Effect: Veil of Spirits]]"
