When you cast the spell, roll 1d8 on the table below to determine the effects of the fumarole.\n\nAny creature caught inside the area of _rainbow fumarole_ when you cast it takes the indicated damage with a basic Reflex save and, on a failure, takes any added effect listed. Creatures must also attempt a saving throw when they move through the spell's area or end their turn in it.
