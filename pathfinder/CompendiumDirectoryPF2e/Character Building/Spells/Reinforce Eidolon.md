    desc: "You focus deeply on the link between you and your eidolon and reinforce your eidolon's defenses. Your eidolon gains a +1 status bonus to AC and saving throws, plus resistance to all damage equal to half the spell's rank. Your eidolon can benefit from either [[Spells/Boost Eidolon|Boost Eidolon]] or Reinforce Eidolon, but not both; if you cast one of these spells during the other's duration, the newer spell replaces the older one.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Reinforce Eidolon|Spell Effect: Reinforce Eidolon]]"
