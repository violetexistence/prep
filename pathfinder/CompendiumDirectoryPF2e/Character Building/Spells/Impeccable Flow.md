    desc: "You attune yourself to an underlying cosmic order to the world. While you remain in tune with this power, you gain a +1 status bonus to Perception checks, saving throws, and skill checks. If you critically fail any check while under the effects of this spell, the bonus ends and you instead have a -1 status penalty to all checks for the remaining duration.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Impeccable Flow|Spell Effect: Impeccable Flow]]\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (5th)** The status bonus increases to +2.\n\n**Heightened (8th)** The status bonus increases to +3.\n* * *\n\n_Note: The automation for the critical failure effect defaults to 10 rounds and must be altered manually._"
