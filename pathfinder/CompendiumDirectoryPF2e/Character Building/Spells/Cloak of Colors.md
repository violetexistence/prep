    desc: "A cloak of swirling colors shrouds the target. Creatures are [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] while adjacent to it, and attacking the target causes a brilliant flash of light. A creature that hits the target with a melee attack must attempt a Will save. The creature is then temporarily immune until the end of its turn; this effect has the incapacitation trait.\n* * *\n\n**Success** The attacker is unaffected.\n\n**Failure** The attacker is [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] for 1 round.\n\n**Critical Failure** The attacker is [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned]] for 1 round"
