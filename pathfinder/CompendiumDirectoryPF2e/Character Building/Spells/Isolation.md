    desc: "You summon a tangible manifestation of loneliness to cloak the target from view as surely as if it were wreathed in darkness. The target attempts a Will saving throw.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The target becomes [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]], but only to its allies. Any creature not allied with the target can see it normally. Effects such as [[Spells/See the Unseen|See the Unseen]] enable an ally to see the target. The target's allies still know the target is present and can still see all the effects of the target's actions.\n\n**Failure** As success, except the target also becomes inaudible to its allies and imperceptible to them through any other senses."
