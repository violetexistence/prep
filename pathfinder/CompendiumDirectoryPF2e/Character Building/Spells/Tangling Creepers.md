    desc: "Dense, twitching creepers sprout from every surface and fill any bodies of water in the area. Any creature moving on the land, or Climbing or Swimming within the creepers, takes a -10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds while in the area. Once per round, you can Sustain the spell to make a vine lash out from any square within the expanse of creepers. This vine has a 15-foot reach. Make a melee spell attack roll against the target; on a success, the vine pulls the target into the creepers and makes it [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] for 1 round or until the creature [[Actions/Escape|Escapes]] (against your spell DC), whichever comes first.\n\n[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Tangling Creepers|Spell Effect: Tangling Creepers]]"
