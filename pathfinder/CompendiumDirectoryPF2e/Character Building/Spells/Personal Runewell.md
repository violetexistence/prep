    desc: "**Area (continued)** 15-foot radius, 30-foot-tall cylinder\n* * *\n\nThe runelords of Thassilon pioneered the creation of runewells, magical artifacts that could extract and store the power of sin magic from mortal souls. A circle of light carves its way across the ground as you create your very own runewell, your personal rune flaring to life within it as you add your own sin to those seven revered in the past. Whenever any creature Casts a Spell within your personal runewell, the well resonates, with your choice of effects.\n\n*   The runewell amplifies the power of your spells, as well as those of your allies. If the spell deals damage and doesn't have a duration, the well adds a status bonus to damage equal to the spell's rank.\n    \n    [[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Personal Runewell|Spell Effect: Personal Runewell]]\n    \n*   The runewell punishes enemies foolish enough to attempt magic in your seat of power, firing arcane bolts at the spell's caster that deal 4d6 force damage, with a basic Reflex save.\n\nIf you cast personal runewell a second time, your previous personal runewell vanishes. You can Dismiss the spell.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The amount of damage dealt by the runewell's bolts increases by 1d6.\n* * *\n\n_PFS Note:_ Within the area of a _personal runewell_ spell, the caster chooses the effect each time a spell is cast. This can be a different effect for different spells."
