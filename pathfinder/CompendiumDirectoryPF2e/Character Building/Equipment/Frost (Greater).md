# Frost (Greater)
## Item 15
### [[cold]][[magical]]


**Price** 6500 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** etched-onto-a-weapon

This weapon is empowered with freezing ice. It deals an additional 1d6 cold damage on a successful Strike. On a critical hit, the target is also [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] until the end of your next turn unless it succeeds at a `DC 34 Fortitude check` save.

Cold damage dealt by this weapon ignores the target's cold resistance.
