# Sapling Shield (Moderate)
## Item 9
### [[magical]]


**Price** 680 gp; 
**Bulk** 2; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

This surprisingly weighty, though well-balanced, wooden buckler (Hardness 8, HP 64, and BT 32) is emblazoned with the image of a sapling. The sapling withers as the shield takes damage.

**Activate** `pf2:1` (concentrate)

* * *

**Effect** The buckler expands, with the sapling image growing into a mighty oak tree. The buckler becomes a tower shield, gaining the corresponding AC bonus, Speed penalty, and ability to [[Actions/Take Cover|Take Cover]]. It keeps the same Hit Points and Broken Threshold, but its Hardness and Bulk increase by 2 in this form. The shield remains in this form until you Activate it again to revert it to a buckler.
