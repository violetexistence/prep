This _+1 striking hand cannon_ is crafted by wrapping the water-producing organ cluster of a grodair around its barrel, eliminating the need for ammunition, though the living tissue must be maintained with 1 sp of specialized nutrient feed each day. If not, its misfire check is `DC 10 Flat check`. If you fail this misfire check, the organ bursts, dealing an amount of bludgeoning damage equal to double the number of weapon damage dice to you and rendering the _hydrocannon_ broken.

**Activate—Tinker Shot** `pf2:2` (manipulation)

**Frequency** once per minute

**Effect** You fiddle with the pressure regulator on the _hydrocannon_ and then make a ranged Strike with the gun. A successful attack has an additional effect depending on which modular configuration the _hydrocannon_ is currently in.

*   **Bludgeoning** The target is pushed 5 feet away from you; this forced movement is increased to 10 feet on a critical hit.
    
*   **Piercing** The target takes a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds for 1 round.
    
*   **Slashing** The target takes 1d6 bleed damage.

**Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials must include the extradimensional organ cluster extracted from a grodair. Harvesting the organs of a grodair in this way differs greatly from the normal method; it takes an hour and a successful `DC 22 Arcana check` check. On a critical failure, the organ cluster bursts and deals 4d6 bludgeoning damage to the harvester.
