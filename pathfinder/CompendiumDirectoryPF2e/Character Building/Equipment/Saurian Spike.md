# Saurian Spike
## Item 9
### [[magical]][[spellheart]]


**Price** 700 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** affixed-to-armor-or-a-weapon

This jagged, bony growth narrows to a sharp, pointed tip. Deep groves from some former battle scar its surface. The bearer of a _saurian spike_ often feels a sudden surge in power and confidence. The spell attack modifier of any spell cast by activating this item is +15.

*   **Armor** You gain imprecise scent with a range of 30 feet.
*   **Weapon** (auditory, emotion, fear, visual) When you cast a polymorph spell by activating the spike, your battle form is exceptionally fearsome. Each enemy in a 30-foot emanation must succeed at a `DC 27 Will check` saving throw or become [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]] ([[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] on a critical failure).
