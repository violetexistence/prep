This fan is useful for elegant dances as well as for slicing unsuspecting foes with the blades along its outer edge. If used in performances, it might be disguised as a frilly accessory, or it might be an obvious, though elegant, weapon.

This elegant +3 greater striking flaming silver fighting fan features sharp silver feathers instead of traditional paper leaves in its design.

* * *

**Activate** `pf2:3` command, envision, Interact

**Frequency** once per day.

* * *

**Effect** You call upon the fan's extradimensional powers to trap a creature in Hao Jin's repository, a small demiplane that holds the countless relics Hao Jin collected over her lifetime (though a trapped creature cannot interact with any of these relics). The fighting fan casts [[Spells/Quandary|Quandary]] on a creature within 30 feet. The fan automatically Sustains the Spell as long as you Strike a creature with it each round. The `DC 34 Survival check` or `DC 34 Perception check` DC to escape the demiplane is 34. The spell ends once the creature escapes, you fail to Strike a creature with the fan during a round, or after 1 minute, whichever comes first.

* * *

**Activate** 10 minutes (envision, Interact)

* * *

**Effect** The fan casts 8th-rank [[Spells/Raise Dead|Raise Dead]], consuming the phoenix fighting fan in the process.
