This kit can be used to clean and polish armor. Creatures wearing armor that has been maintained by this kit gain a +1 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks to [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] on soldiers, guards, Gorumites, and other martially minded characters. This bonus expires after 24 hours, or if the armor is soiled in some way, such as by walking through a sewer or falling in a mud pit.
