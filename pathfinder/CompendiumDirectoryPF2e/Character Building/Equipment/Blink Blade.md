The blade of this _+2 striking dagger_ is etched with whirling portals, and a single blue sapphire adorns its hilt. It feels lightweight and is always slightly warm to the touch.

**Activate** `pf2:2` Interact

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** You cast [[Spells/Translocate|Translocate]]. The space you leave and the one you appear in are filled with puffs of smoke that make anyone within [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] until they leave the smoke or until the end of your next turn, at which point the smoke dissipates. When used in strong winds, the smoke disperses immediately.
