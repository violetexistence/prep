# Buckler

### 


**Price** 1 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

This very small shield is a favorite of duelists and quick, lightly armored warriors. It's typically made of steel and strapped to your forearm. You can [[Actions/Raise a Shield|Raise a Shield]] with your buckler as long as you have that hand free or are holding a light object that's not a weapon in that hand.
