**Price** 6300 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

The best minds among the Magaambyan, Iomedaean, and Pharasmin Knights of Lastwall joined together to create these small, leather-bound journals. While you're holding an _undead compendium_, the information it contains slips into your mind, granting you a +2 item bonus to Recall Knowledge checks to obtain information about undead creatures.

* * *

**Activate** 10 minutes (envision, Interact; auditory, linguistic)

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You study the journal, focusing on a specific type of undead creature, and as the information fills the pages, you recite it aloud to your allies. Select ghost, ghoul, graveknight, lich, mummy, vampire, wight, or zombie. You and up to four allies that hear you read the information aloud during the activation gain a +2 item bonus on attack rolls and saving throws against that type of undead for the next 10 minutes. To benefit from the bonus, your allies must listen attentively and can't perform any other activities during the activation time.
