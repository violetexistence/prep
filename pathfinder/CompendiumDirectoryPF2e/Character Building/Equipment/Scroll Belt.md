# Scroll Belt
## Item 3
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")


**Price** 15 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

These belts are specially designed to allow for writing along the inside surface. You can scribe a spell to a scroll belt, Crafting the scroll as normal. A scroll belt can only hold a single spell, and you must Cast the Spell before you can scribe another spell to the belt. You can't Cast a Spell from the belt while wearing it; you must remove the belt with an Interact action. A scroll belt acts as a mundane belt, but when a spell is scribed on it, any creature can immediately discern that an unattended belt holds magic. If you're wearing the belt, a creature can notice the belt holds a spell with a successful `Perception check` check against your Stealth DC.
