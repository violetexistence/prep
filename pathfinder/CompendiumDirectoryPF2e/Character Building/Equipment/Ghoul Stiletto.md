A _ghoul stiletto_ is a _+1 dagger_ wrapped in the still-undead skin of a ghoul. While you wield the dagger, you gain a +1 status bonus to all saves against curses and olfactory effects.

**Activate** `pf2:1` (concentrate, divine, manipulate, olfactory)

**Frequency** once per hour

**Effect** The ghoul stiletto afflicts the next living target struck by the dagger with a terrible wound that emits the foul stench of the grave. The creature emits a stench aura in a 10-foot emanation for 1 minute. During that time, the affected creature, as well as any creature that starts or ends its turn in the aura, must succeed at a `DC 17 Fortitude check` save or become [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] (plus [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] as long as it's sickened on a critical failure). A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune to all stench auras for 1 minute.

**Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials must include skin from a ghoul.
