Wielded by wealthy Taldan knights against the Goroth Lodge, this +1 striking returning hatchet has an axe head resembling a roaring lion's head.

* * *

**Activate—Slash and Burn** `pf2:r` (manipulate)

**Trigger** You critically succeed at a Strike against a plant

**Effect** The weapon's etchings pulse with green energy, as it tears through bark, leaf, and wood. The clear cutter's axe deals an additional 1d10 persistent fire damage to the plant.

* * *

**Activate—Mow Down** `pf2:2` (manipulate)

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** You hurl the axe horizontally, sending it flying through the air in a wild, whirling cyclone. The axe flies in a 30-foot emanation around you, eliminating all non-magical undergrowth and any resulting difficult terrain, cover, and concealment in area. It attempts to counteract one magical effect that affects a plant in the area (counteract +20). Plant creatures in the area take 5d6 slashing damage (`DC 25 Reflex check` save). As the axe finishes its circuit, it returns to your hand.
