A mask of the cursed eye is decorated with at least one wide, staring eye. The first time each day you're targeted with a detection, prediction, revelation, or scrying spell by a creature on your plane that you can't perceive, the creature targeting you must attempt a `DC 24 Will check` save. This effect is automatic and does not require you to Activate the item.
