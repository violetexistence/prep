Sold only in single sticks, this foul incense comes coated with a bevy of alchemical smoke that activates in the presence of intense heat, releasing its namesake pungent odor. Adding this catalyst to a [[Spells/Wall of Fire|Wall of Fire]] spell fills all squares adjacent to the wall with thick, foul smoke. Creatures in this area are [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]], and other creatures are concealed to creatures in the area. The smoke lasts for the duration of the spell. The incense can be used with a _wall of fire_ of any level.
