# Cowl of Keys
## Item 17
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[apex]][[invested]][[magical]]


**Price** 15000 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** worncloak

This simple, tattered cloak is a faded green and features small, stylized keys sewn throughout its length. While wearing the cloak, you fade into the shadows and gain a +3 item bonus to Stealth checks. When you invest the cloak, you either increase your Dexterity score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever would give you a higher score.

**Activate** `pf2:1` Interact

**Effect** You brush your hand against the cloak and your fingers transform into picks, tension wrenches, skeleton keys, and any other tools, providing you with a full set of [[Equipment/Thieves' Toolkit|Thieves' Tools]]. This transformation doesn't otherwise hamper the normal use of your fingers or hands. These tools never break when you critically fail your check to [[Actions/Pick a Lock|Pick a Lock]]. You can Activate the cloak again to revert your fingers to normal.

**Activate** `pf2:2` envision, Interact

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** You place your hand against a wall, floor, or ceiling. You create a magical doorway within the surface that a creature can move through, as if the door had always been there. The doorway can penetrate up to 10 feet of material; particularly thick material, such as heavy stone walls, can cause this effect to fail, expending its use for the day. You can use an Interact action on the door to remove it from the surface and return it to its previous shape.
