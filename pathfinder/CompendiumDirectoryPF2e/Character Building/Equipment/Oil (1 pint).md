# Oil (1 pint)

### 

**Category** oil; 
**Price** 1 cp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-two-hands

You can use oil to fuel lanterns, but you can also set a pint of oil aflame and throw it. You must first spend an Interact action preparing the oil, then throw it with another action as a ranged attack. If you hit, it splatters on the creature or in a single 5-foot square you target. You must succeed at a `DC 10 Flat check` for the oil to ignite successfully when it hits. If the oil ignites, the target takes 1d6 fire damage.
