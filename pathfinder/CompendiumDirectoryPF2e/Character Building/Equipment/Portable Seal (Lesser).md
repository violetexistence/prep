A portable seal is a stiff framework of copper wires and strategically placed hinges, so that when the device is snapped open it forms an instant geometric design. A tiny Stasian coil is attached, which when activated runs a mixture of occult energy and high-voltage electricity through the wire. The design covers a 5-foot burst when unfolded and must be unfolded into an area free of major obstructions such as rocks or hostile creatures. When a creature with the summoned trait attempts to enter the seal's area or make a melee Strike against a creature in that area, the summoned creature must attempt a `DC 20 Will check` save.

* * *

**Success** The action occurs normally, and the creature is immune to the effects of this portable seal this round.

**Failure** The movement or Strike is disrupted, but the creature is immune to further effects of the portable seal this round.

**Critical Failure** The movement or Strike is disrupted.
