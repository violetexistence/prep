_Silencing ammunition_ is particularly dense and seems to dampen sounds around it. On a successful Strike, an activated piece of _silencing ammunition_ creates a 2nd-rank [[Spells/Silence|Silence]] effect on the target. The target can resist the effects of the ammunition with a successful `DC 25 Will check` save, though it takes a -2 circumstance penalty if the Strike was a critical hit. While the effect is active, the target can use an Interact action to try to tug out the arrow or bolt and end the effect early; this requires a successful `DC 25 Will check`.
