Originally created by Taldan cavaliers acting as knights errant, _chivalric emblems_ have since spread across the Inner Sea region and beyond. A _chivalric emblem_ is crafted in the form of a small iron shield, embossed with heraldic insignia. These whetstones call protective spirits into a weapon; the effects last for 1 hour. While wielding a weapon under the effect of a _chivalric emblem_, if you witness an ally being reduced to 0 Hit Points or taking damage from a critical Strike, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to attack rolls and damage with that weapon against the creature that damaged that ally for the remainder of the _chivalric emblem_'s duration.
