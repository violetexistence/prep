### [[invested]][[occult]]


**Price** 600 gp;

This gemstone grants its wearer a +2 item bonus to saving throws.

Each _heartstone_ is powered by the spirit of a specific night hag. If it's separated from her for 24 hours (or she's been dead for 24 hours), it becomes a nonmagical gemstone. A heartstone allows the hag to use additional occult innate spells: [[Spells/Ethereal Jaunt|Ethereal Jaunt]] (9th level) and [[Spells/Seize Soul|Seize Soul]] at will, and [[Spells/Shadow Blast|Shadow Blast]] twice per day.
