# Anglerfish Lantern
## Item 5
### [[magical]][[water]]


**Price** 150 gp; 
**Bulk** 1; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

This [[Equipment/Lantern (Bull's Eye)|bull's-eye lantern]] is either stylized after an anglerfish or made from the taxidermy of one. While it can be lit as usual, the _anglerfish lantern_ automatically shines when submerged in water.

* * *

**Activate—Mesmerizing Lights** `pf2:2` (concentrate, manipulate)

**Frequency** once per hour

**Effect** All creatures within the bright light of the _anglerfish lantern_ must succeed at a `DC 19 Will check` save or be [[Conditions/Fascinated|Fascinated]] by the light for 1 round (1 minute on a critical failure). The fascination ends if the light is extinguished. Aquatic animals and creatures with the water trait take a –2 circumstance penalty to this check. Regardless of the result, the creature then becomes immune to this effect for the next 24 hours.
