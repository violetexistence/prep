A _bravery baldric_ is a belt that wraps around the shoulder and draws on your well of courage. When you critically succeed on a save against a fear effect or reduce your frightened condition to 0, the baldric gains 1 charge, which slightly alters the color. A bravery baldric can hold up to 2 charges, and its charges reset to 0 when you invest it. You can have only one bravery baldric invested at a time.
