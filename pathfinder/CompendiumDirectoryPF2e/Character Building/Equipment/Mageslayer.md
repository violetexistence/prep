This roughly forged _+1 striking scimitar_ is a favorite instrument of battlefield operatives seeking to weaken an enemy's forces by strategically eliminating their magical support. A mageslayer deals an additional 1d6 spirit damage to any creature it Strikes that's capable of casting spells from the arcane tradition. When wearing or wielding a mageslayer, you gain resistance 5 to damage from spells from the arcane tradition.
