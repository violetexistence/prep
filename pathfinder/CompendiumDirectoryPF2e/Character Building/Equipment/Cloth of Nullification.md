# Cloth of Nullification
## Item 20
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[magical]]


**Price** 75000 gp; 
**Bulk** 1; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

This small piece of embroidered cloth is inimical to all magic.

**Activateâ€”Nullify Magic** `pf2:2` (manipulate)

* * *

**Effect** You cover a magic item with the cloth or wave the cloth near a magic effect and attempt to counteract the effect or item. The cloth's counteract check modifier is +32, and its counteract rank is 10. Regardless of the result, the cloth of nullification can't be activated again for 2d6 hours. On a success, the effect or item is deactivated for the same amount of time, and its duration, if any, continues to expire during that time. With a successful counteract check, you can instead choose to completely absorb the magic from the effect or item into the cloth of nullification. If you do, both become completely non-magical and their magic can't be recovered, even by the remake spell.

The cloth of nullification automatically fails to counteract most artifacts and similarly powerful items
