This small figurine is carved from soapstone in the shape of a deity or guardian, facing both front and back to indicate unflagging vigilance. The spell attack modifier of any spell cast by activating this item is +20.

*   **Armor** You gain resistance 5 against ranged weapon attacks.
*   **Weapon** When you hit with a Strike using the affixed weapon, or when a spell effect you created by activating the statuette hits with a Strike, you can choose a creature adjacent to the creature that was hit. That creature gains a +1 status bonus to AC until the start of your next turn. No more than one creature can benefit from this each turn.
