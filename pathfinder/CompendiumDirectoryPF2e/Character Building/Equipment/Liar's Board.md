# Liar's Board
## Item 5
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")


**Price** 90 gp; 
**Bulk** 2; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-two-hands

This clockwork game board contains 6 hidden compartments that can be opened by moving the game pieces in specific, preset patterns. Each chamber has a unique combination, and only one chamber can be opened at a time. Once a chamber is opened, a new combination can be set as a 1-minute activity. You can identify a Liar's Board as a clockwork device with a successful `DC 25 Perception check` check, and you can find an individual hidden compartment with a successful `DC 30 Perception check` check. The GM rolls a d6 to determine which chamber is discovered, rolling again if the result is one you're already aware of. You can force open a compartment you've identified with a successful `DC 30 Thievery check` check, but tampering will be obvious unless you critically succeed at the check. If you spend at least 1 hour examining the game board, you can instead attempt to deduce the correct combination to open a compartment with a successful `DC 30 Society check` or `DC 30 Games Lore check` check.
