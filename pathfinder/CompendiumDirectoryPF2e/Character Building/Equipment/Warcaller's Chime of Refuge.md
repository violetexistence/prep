This chime's carvings depict a series of warding runes that evoke feelings of serene protection. When activated, you touch the chime to yourself or a willing creature. The target gains the effects of [[Spells/Sanctuary|Sanctuary]] (`DC 20 Will check` save). You can use this chime up to five times per day, but each use must target a different creature.
