**Price** 65000 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** affixed-to-armor-or-a-weapon

The golden religious symbol on the top of this spherical incense holder shifts its form to match the faith of its bearer. You gain no benefit from a judgment thurible if you don't worship a deity. The spell DC of any spell cast by activating this item is 43.

*   **Armor** After you cast a spell by activating the thurible, the thurible casts 3rd-rank [[Spells/Protection|Protection]] on you, with a duration of 1 round.
*   **Weapon** After you cast a spell by activating the thurible, the weapon gains a rune that lasts until the end of your next turn. It gains the [[Equipment/Holy|Holy]] rune if your deity allows holy sanctification or the [[Equipment/Unholy|Unholy]] rune if your deity allows unholy sanctification. If your deity allows both, you can choose which rune the weapon gains. If your deity allows neither, your weapon doesn't gain a rune. The extra damage from this rune is 2d6.
