This alchemical candle is attached to a tall pole and grounding stake. When the flare is lit, it sprays a concentrated cloud of pheromones to attract the attention of a specific kind of animal (see [[Equipment/Animal Pheromones (Greater)|alchemical pheromones]]). Similar to animal pheromones, when you learn the formula for a pheromone flare, you learn the formulas for all common animals.

A pheromone flare has a built-in delayed activation timer of up to 1 hour. When it's activated, the flare releases a cloud of pheromones in a 60-foot emanation that lasts for 1 hour. A strong wind reduces the emanation to 15 feet for as long as the wind lasts. Moving the flare after it has been activated ends the effect. A designated animal that enters the area must attempt a `DC 35 Will check` save with the following effects. Animals with an Intelligence modifier of –3 or higher increase the result of their save by one step.

**Critical Success** The animal is unaffected and temporarily immune for 24 hours.

**Success** The animal is unaffected but must attempt a new save every 10 minutes it remains within the area.

**Failure** The animal is attracted by the pheromones, following the cloud to its source. The creature becomes [[Conditions/Fascinated|Fascinated]] until it reaches the flare and spends 1 round investigating it. After this, it becomes temporarily immune for 24 hours.

**Critical Failure** As failure, except the fascination lasts for up to 1 hour, though the animal can attempt a new save against the effect every 10 minutes. The animal takes a –1 status penalty to this save that increases by 1 with each subsequent failure or critical failure, up to a maximum of a –3 status penalty
