When you Activate a _nap gas dispenser_, you can either place it in an adjacent space or toss it up to 30 feet away. Once you've done so, the metallic canister instantly disperses knockout gas in a 15-foot burst. Creatures in the area must attempt a `DC 23 Fortitude check` save, with the following results. This is a poison and incapacitation effect.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature takes a â€“2 status penalty to Perception checks and is [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] for 1 round.

**Failure** The creature is slowed 1 for 1 minute. At the end of their next turn, they fall [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] and fall [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]] for 1 minute. A creature can Interact to shake the creature awake as normal, but this doesn't shorten the duration of the slowed condition.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature is slowed 1 for 1 hour and it takes three Interact actions to wake them.
