# Mask (Fine)

### 


**Price** 2 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** wornmask

A mask helps you use the [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] action to pass yourself off as someone you aren't.

This well-crafted mask, suitable for a noble at a masquerade, is made with impeccable craftsmanship and expensive material, such as porcelain and gold filigree.
