An _exploration lens_ is a magical glass lens designed for a [[Equipment/Lantern (Bull's Eye)|Bull's Eye Lantern]]. When light from the lantern passes through the lens, it alters the light to make it easier to perform a common exploration activity with the lantern.

Alternatively, an _exploration lens_ can be installed in a [[Equipment/Wayfinder|Wayfinder]] like an aeon stone. In this case, light (such as that from a [[Equipment/Lantern (Hooded)|Lantern (Hooded)]], [[Equipment/Torch|Torch]], or [[Spells/Light|Light]] spell) must still pass through the lens and you must hold the wayfinder in your hand for it to function.

There are several different types of _exploration lens_, each granting benefits with a different type of exploration activity. Each type of lens is distinguishable from all the other types by holding it up to a bright light.

**Type: Detecting**

When held up to light, this lens sparkles as though infused with glitter.

While [[Actions/Detect Magic|Detecting Magic]] in exploration mode, when the lantern's light falls upon something you detect as magical, it pulsates faintly. This makes it easier to triangulate the magic, since you can use the cone of the bull's-eye lantern instead of the circular pulse of detect magic.

You also gain a +2 item bonus to checks to Identify Magic within the light.
