# Winged
## Item 13
### [[magical]]


**Price** 2500 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** etched-onto-armor

This rune is a swirling glyph on the front of the armor. A large pair of transparent, ephemeral wings floats out from the back of the armor.

**Activateâ€”Take to the Skies** `pf2:2` (concentrate, manipulate)

**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

**Effect** You trace the rune on the front of the breastplate, and the armor's ephemeral wings grow tangible, granting you a fly Speed of 25 feet or your land Speed, whichever is slower. This effect lasts for 5 minutes or until you Dismiss it. Once the effect ends, the wings disappear completely, reappearing in their ephemeral form 1 hour later
