# Bi-Resonant Wayfinder
## Item 6
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[illusion]][[invested]][[magical]]


**Price** 200 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** worn

A _bi-resonant wayfinder_ is inlaid with intricate platinum wires in a complex array of conduits for magical energy. These conduits control the resonant interference of aeon stones.

A _bi-resonant wayfinder_ works just like a regular [[Equipment/Wayfinder|Wayfinder]] except it has two aeon stone slots, and the aeon stones in both slots grant their resonant powers without interfering with each other. The _bi-resonant wayfinder_ and the two aeon stones count as two items toward your investiture limit.
