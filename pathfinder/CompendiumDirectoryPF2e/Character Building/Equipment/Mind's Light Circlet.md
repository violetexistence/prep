# Mind's Light Circlet
## Item 11
### [[focused]][[invested]][[magical]]


**Price** 1200 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** wornheadwear

Gemstones of many colors adorn the silver of a _mind's light circlet_. When you're charged with mental power, the jewels scintillate with light, with different gems resonating based on your emotions. If you have at least 1 Focus Point, the gems cast dim light in a 10-foot radius. When you amp a spell, the light increases to bright light in a 20-foot radius (and dim light to the next 20 feet) until the start of your next turn.

You gain a +2 item bonus to Occultism checks. You also gain the following amp, which you can apply to any of your psi cantrips that have a target or area, much like an amp gained from a feat.

**Amp** You transfer some of the magical luminescence from the mind's light circlet to one of the creatures. Choose a creature targeted by the spell or in its area. Until the start of your next turn, that creature sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius (and dim light to the next 20 feet) and can't be [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]]. If the creature is [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]], it's concealed while alight, rather than being undetected.
