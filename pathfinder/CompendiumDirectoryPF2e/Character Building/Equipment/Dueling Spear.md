This spear has a spade-like blade at one end and a forked blade at the other, making it resemble a large arrow. It's well balanced for spinning and twisting maneuvers. The spade-like end can be used for slashing and stabbing, while the forked end is effective at wrenching a weapon from an enemy's grasp.
