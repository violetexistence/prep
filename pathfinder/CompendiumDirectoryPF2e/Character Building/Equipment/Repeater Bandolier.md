This leather bandolier holds up to three magazines for repeating weapons in leather pockets that pop open with the quick flick of a thumb. You can replace a magazine in a repeating weapon with a magazine from a worn bandolier faster, reducing the number of Interact actions required by 1. You can wear only one repeater bandolier at a time.
