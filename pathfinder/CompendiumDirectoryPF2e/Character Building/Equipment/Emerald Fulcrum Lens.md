# Emerald Fulcrum Lens
## Item 10
### [unique](unique "Unique Rarity Trait")[[invested]][[occult]][[void]]


**Price** 1000 gp; 
**Bulk** 3; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

This concave green lens is pitted and flawed; its jagged edges can cut those who don't handle it with care. While you have the _Emerald Fulcrum Lens_ invested, your flesh appears waxen and pallid. You gain void healing and [[Spells/Harm|Harm]] spells gain a +4 status bonus to the Hit Points they restore to you. You can also activate the lens in the following ways.

[[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Emerald Fulcrum Lens|Effect: Emerald Fulcrum Lens]]

* * *

**Activate** `pf2:2` Interact (healing)

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** You grasp the _Emerald Fulcrum Lens_ in one hand, regain 30 Hit Points, and gain a +2 item bonus to saving throws against magic for 1 round.

[[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Emerald Fulcrum Lens (Saving Throw)|Effect: Emerald Fulcrum Lens (Saving Throw)]]

* * *

**Activate** `pf2:2` Interact (attack, possession)

While grasping the lens, make a melee spell attack roll with a modifier of +20. On a hit, you force the splinter of Nhimbaloth's essence from the lens to possess the target. You're no longer invested in the lens, and the target gains the benefits as though it had invested the lens but can't activate the lens's other abilities. This effect is permanent, but it can be ended by any effect that removes a possession effect. The lens doesn't have any magical abilities until the possession effect ends; when it does, the essence returns to the lens.
