# Resonating Fork
## Item 5
### [[magical]][[sonic]][[spellheart]]


**Price** 140 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** affixed-to-armor-or-a-weapon

This two-pronged fork of metal emits a constant low hum, vibrating slightly when touched. The spell attack modifier of any spell cast by activating this item is +9, and the spell DC is 19.

*   **Armor** You gain resistance 2 to sonic damage and a +1 item bonus to saving throws against effects with the auditory or sonic trait.
*   **Weapon** After you cast a sonic spell by activating the fork, the weapon reverberates with trapped sound waves. Your next Strike causes the target to be [[Conditions/Deafened|Deafened]] for 1 round if it hits (or for 3 rounds on a critical hit). If you don't make a Strike by the end of your next turn, the sound waves dissipate with no effect.
