# Zarothrask's Contract
## Item 9
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[contract]][[invested]][[occult]]


**Price** 0 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** other

You've bargained for power with a gongorinan, but in return, you must avoid furthering demonic goals. You gain a +2 item bonus to Athletics checks to [[Actions/Disarm|Disarm]] manufactured items and to [[Actions/Grapple|Grapple]]. Once per day, the gongorinan can warp your body with animal features; you must attempt a `DC 25 Fortitude check` save or become [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]]. When you recover from the sickened condition, your features revert to normal. The gongorinan will usually do this if you sin or aid a demon, even unintentionally.

**Activateâ€”Gongorinan's Emergence** `pf2:2` (concentrate, mental, morph, occult, unholy)

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** Stony tentacles burst out of your body, lashing at foes. Creatures in a 10-foot emanation take 6d6 bludgeoning + 2d6 mental damage (`DC 25 Fortitude check` save); on a failure, the creature also becomes [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] (sickened 2 on a critical failure) as parts of their anatomy temporarily warp into animal features. When a creature recovers from the sickened condition, its features revert to normal.
