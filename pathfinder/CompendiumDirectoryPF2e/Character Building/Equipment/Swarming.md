# Swarming
## Item 9
### [[magical]]


**Price** 700 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** etched-onto-thrown-weapon

Able to copy itself many times over when thrown until the air is filled with deadly blades, a swarming weapon turns a single weapon into a shower of devastation.

**Activate** `pf2:2` (concentrate)

**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

**Effect** You fling your weapon and it multiplies as it flies through the air, filling a 30-foot cone. All creatures within the area take damage equal to double the weapon's number of damage dice, with a `DC 27 Reflex check` save.
