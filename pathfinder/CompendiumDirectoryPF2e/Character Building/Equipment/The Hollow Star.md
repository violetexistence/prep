# The Hollow Star
## Item 9
### [unique](unique "Unique Rarity Trait")[[magical]]


**Price** 700 gp; 
**Bulk** 1; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

This roughly spherical mass of orange crystal is about the size of a human head. The sphere is opaque but glows from within as if it contained a bright flickering flame—the _Hollow Star_ emits bright light in a 60-foot radius (and dim light to the next 60 feet). Any creature within the bright light of the _Hollow Star_ gains a +1 item bonus to Occultism checks. Deros in the bright light shed by the _Hollow Star_ suffer distracting but pleasant hallucinations and strange visions, and they become [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] when in this illumination. If you're lawful, you're [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 2]] while carrying the _Hollow Star_. If you touch the _Hollow Star_, your dreams the next time you sleep are strange, unsettling, hard to remember, and carry a vague sense of elation, doom, or both. Upon awakening, you must succeed at a `DC 25 Will check` save or become [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] by unsettling dreams that feel disturbingly like memories from a life lived on a distant dying planet.

The Keepers of the _Hollow Star_ believe that this unique magical item, if allowed to bathe for an unspecified amount of time in sunlight, will bring Azathoth into that world's sun to destroy it. However, the item has no actual capacity to do so. Yet.

* * *

**Activate** `pf2:r` (divination)

**Trigger** You cast a spell or use an effect that has the linguistic trait

**Effect** You speak in Aklo when using the linguistic spell or effect, even if you don't normally speak Aklo. If the spell or effect requires a spell attack roll, you gain a +1 item bonus to the roll. If the spell or effect can be resisted with a saving throw, all saves against the effect suffer a –1 item penalty.

* * *

**Activate** `pf2:2` (death, emotion, fear, illusion, mental)

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** The _Hollow Star_ casts [[Spells/Phantasmal Killer|Phantasmal Killer]] (`DC 25 Will check`, `DC 25 Fortitude check`). The target of this effect receives a brief but overwhelming vision of the world ending as an immense explosion in the sky expands to engulf the world.

* * *

**Activate** `pf2:3` (conjuration)

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** The _Hollow Star_ conjures an aberration to fight for you. This works like [[Spells/Summon Animal|Summon Animal]], except you summon a common creature that has the aberration trait and whose level is 3 or lower.
