This _+1 striking returning spear_ is warm to the touch. The head of the spear is crafted from gold with ivory inlay and has a ruby set into the shaft. You can make the spear glow like a torch or suppress its light by using an action, which has the concentrate trait.

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** You touch the ruby and hurl the spear at a square within 40 feet. When the spear lands, it detonates, dealing 6d6 fire damage (`DC 23 Reflex check`) to all creatures in a 10-foot emanation. It then flies back to your hand.
