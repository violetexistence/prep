Crafted for a long-forgotten knight to slay Avathrael Realmshaper, this _+2 striking dragon bane lance_ is crafted from gleaming steel with a golden silk banner depicting a radiant sun. When in a location of dim light or darkness, the _lance of sun's radiance_ sheds bright light in a 60-foot radius, and dim light for a further 60 feet.
