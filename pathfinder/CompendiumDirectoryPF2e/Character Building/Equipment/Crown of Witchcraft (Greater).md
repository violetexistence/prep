# Crown of Witchcraft (Greater)
## Item 18
### [[focused]][[invested]][[magical]]


**Price** 21000 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** wornheadwear

An elegant accoutrement for a witch who has come into the higher echelons of power, a _crown of witchcraft_ typically looks like a garland of flowering twigs, a jeweled circlet, or a tall hat of fine fabric. You gain a +2 item bonus to Intimidation checks, and if you're a witch, you gain a +3 item bonus to your patron skill.

If you have a familiar, you can attach a small portion of the crown's material to your familiar, such as a strip of fabric from a hat tied around its tail or a sprig of natural material linked to its collar; the familiar doesn't need to invest the item itself. If you do this, your familiar gains the tough pet ability as long as the crown is invested by you.
