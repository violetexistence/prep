The metal plates of this _+2 greater resilient full plate_ are covered by a bright tabard featuring a distinctive coat of arms divided into four fields.

**Trigger** You kill or destroy a creature of a level equal to or greater than your _victory plate_ (adjusted as usual if you add fundamental runes to victory plate). This creature must have one of the traits listed in the second activation

**Effect** You direct the armor to commemorate your victory. The coat of arms on the armor's tabard shifts to incorporate heraldry related to the slain creature, and the victory is recorded within the tabard. If you have already recorded four victories, choose one to replace with the new victory.
