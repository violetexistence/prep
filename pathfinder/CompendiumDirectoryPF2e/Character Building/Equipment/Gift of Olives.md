# Gift of Olives
## Item 3
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[magical]][[plant]]


**Price** 48 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

This expertly trimmed olive branch remains lush and vibrant, even months after being ritually harvested. With a little soil and patience, it can quickly grow into a sheltering tree that later bestows the user with a new _gift of olives_.

**Activateâ€”Sew the Cutting** `pf2:2` (healing, manipulate, plant)

**Requirements** You are outside and standing atop an unoccupied 5-foot square with some soil

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You drive one end of the cutting into the soil. The cutting immediately grows into an olive tree whose boughs shelter a 15-foot-diameter area. Creatures in the sheltered area gain resistance 3 to any environmental damage, gain a +1 status bonus to saving throws against environmental hazards, and gain a +1 status bonus to Survival checks to Subsist. After 10 minutes, the tree sprouts 8 olives, each of which can be eaten as an action to restore 1 Hit Point and nourish the eater as if they had consumed a full meal. After 8 hours, the olives lose their potency, and the _gift of olives_ cutting detaches from the tree and falls harmlessly to the ground. The olive tree loses its protective abilities and becomes a normal, non-magical olive tree that survives so long as it's growing in a suitable location.
