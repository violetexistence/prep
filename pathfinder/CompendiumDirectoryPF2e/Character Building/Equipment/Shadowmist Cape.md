**Price** 40000 gp;

This black cape flows more like a vaporous liquid than fabric. The cape grants you a +3 item bonus to Stealth checks. When you invest the cape, you either increase your Dexterity modifier by 1 or increase it to +4, whichever would give you a higher value.

**Activate** `pf2:r` (manipulate)

**Frequency** once per hour

**Trigger** A creature misses you with an attack

**Effect** Attempt a Stealth check against the triggering creature's Perception DC. If you roll a success, you're [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] from that creature until the end of your next turn or until right after you use a hostile action against that creature. If you roll a critical success, you're hidden from that creature until the end of your next turn, even if you use hostile actions against that creature.

**Activate** `pf2:2` (manipulate)

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** With a twirl of the cape, you transform yourself into a puff of gray smoke. You cast [[Spells/Vapor Form|Vapor Form]] on yourself.
