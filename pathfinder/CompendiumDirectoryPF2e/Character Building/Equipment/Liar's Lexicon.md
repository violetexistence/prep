# Liar's Lexicon
## Item 10
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[grimoire]][[magical]]


**Price** 1000 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** other

The covers of this book are bound in scratchy, purple leatherâ€”hide harvested from a mind-manipulating wormlike monster known as a seugathi. The margins of this grimoire contain hundreds of tips and notes to avoid having your lies discovered. When you prepare spells from a _liar's lexicon_, you gain a +2 item bonus to Deception checks to [[Actions/Lie|Lie]].

**Activate** `pf2:1` envision (spellshape)

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** If your next action is to cast a spell that has the emotion trait, your skill at manipulation and exploiting emotion enhance the spell. The spell gains the linguistic trait. Attempt a Deception check to Lie as you cast the spell against the Perception DC of all those observing you. Those you succeed against think you were merely talking, not casting a spell on a creature.
