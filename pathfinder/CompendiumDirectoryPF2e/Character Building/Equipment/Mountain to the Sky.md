# Mountain to the Sky
## Item 16
### [unique](unique "Unique Rarity Trait")[[magical]][[structure]]


**Price** 10000 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

**Activate** 1 minute (Interact)

This tiny, carved walnut shell contains a sacred mountain within. You can only activate _mountain to the sky_ on an unoccupied patch of earth or soil. When activated, the walnut transforms into an impossibly steep mountain, 5,000 feet tall and 100 feet wide at the base. Climbing the mountain requires 8 hours and a successful `DC 35 Athletics check` check. After activating it, if you climb to the top of the mountain without any assistance from flight or magic, the mountain _plane shifts_ you to _Heaven_ when you reach the summit. You can return the mountain to the sky into the shape of a walnut shell as a 1-minute activity, which has the _concentrate_ and _manipulate_ traits, so long as no living creatures are present on the mountain.
