**Effect** You focus on any spot you can see within 5 miles through the spyglass and rotate its parts in a meticulous order. You and up to 4 willing creatures adjacent to you are instantly teleported to that spot. If there's not enough room for everyone, only you are transported. If there's not enough room for you, the teleportation fails.
