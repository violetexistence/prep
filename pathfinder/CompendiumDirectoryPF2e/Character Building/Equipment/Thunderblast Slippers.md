# Thunderblast Slippers
## Item 9
### [[invested]][[magical]][[sonic]]


**Price** 650 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** wornshoes

Unassuming in appearance, these slippers indicate their nature only with a signature strip of yellow stitching. You gain a +2 item bonus to Acrobatics checks.

* * *

**Activate** `pf2:2` (concentrate, manipulate)

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** You move like the wind, with precision and speed. You Stride up to 60 feet; this movement doesn't trigger reactions. When you stop, if you've moved at least 30 feet from where you started, you release a thunderous 5-foot emanation that deals 2d6 bludgeoning damage and 2d6 sonic damage with a `DC 25 Fortitude check`. A creature that critically fails its save is also knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]].
