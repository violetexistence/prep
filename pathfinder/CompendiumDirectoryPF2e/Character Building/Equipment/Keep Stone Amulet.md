# Keep Stone Amulet

### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[invested]][[magical]]


**Price** 38000 gp;

**Usage** worn

The superior adamantine-lead alloy known as keep stone is as highly prized as it is expensive, and for good reason: keep stone combines the Hardness and durability of the finest metal with inherent magical protection. Not only does the metal itself resist magical effects, but anyone in proximity to a large amount of it also enjoys a degree of protection from divination magic. Dwarven crafters have attempted to make this extra protection more portable and more affordable in the form of _keep stone amulets_. Each amulet is unique in its exact shape, size, thickness, and decorations, but typically, a keep stone amulet is roughly palm-sized and engraved with clan symbols, holy aphorisms, or a favorite line of poetry.

While wearing a _keep stone amulet_, if you're the target of a spell with the detection or scrying trait, the caster must succeed at a `DC 5 Flat check` or lose the spell.
