This _+1 striking scythe_ is made from the cruel, blackened branches of the carnivorous scythe tree, which hungrily drink up spilled blood.

* * *

**Activate—Root in Blood** `pf2:1` (manipulate)

**Requirements** Your last action was a successful Strike with this weapon and your target isn't currently taking any persistent bleed damage

**Effect** You break off a piece of the _bloodgorger scythe_ inside your enemy to feed on their blood and sprout into a new tree. The target takes 1 bleed damage at the end of their turn. Each failure to stop the bleeding increases this bleed damage by 1 as a small scythe tree grows from the wound, to a maximum of 3 persistent bleed damage.

* * *

**Activate—Sapling Slash** `pf2:1` (concentrate)

**Requirements** A target has a piece of the _bloodgorger scythe_ broken off inside them and has failed to recover from the persistent bleed damage for 3 consecutive turns

**Effect** The sprouted scythe tree grows large enough to be commanded. It makes a melee Strike against the target or a creature adjacent to the target, with a +18 to hit and dealing 1d10 slashing damage.

* * *

**Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials must include branches and roots from a scythe tree.
