The Inquisitor represents the search for the truth and the power to see through lies. As long as you have The Inquisitor invested, the results of your Perception Checks to [[Actions/Sense Motive|Sense Motive]] against targets that are equal to or lower than your level are increased by one degree of success. Against targets that are higher level than you, you instead gain a +2 item bonus to your check. This bonus increases to +3 if you are at least 17th level.

**Activate** `pf2:2` envision, Interact (linguistic, mental)

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You swipe the card over the head of an adjacent creature to delve into their thoughts. You cast [[Spells/Mind Probe|Mind Probe]], but as a two-action spell rather than one that takes 1 minute to cast. The rank of the spell is one-half your level, rounded down (minimum 5th level), and the save DC is your class DC or spell DC (`Will check`).
