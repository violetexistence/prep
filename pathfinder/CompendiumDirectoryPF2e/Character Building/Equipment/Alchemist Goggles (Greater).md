These brass goggles are engraved with flame patterns and have thick, heavy lenses.

While worn, they give you a +2 item bonus to Crafting checks to [[Actions/Craft|Craft]] alchemical items. When making Strikes with alchemical bombs, you ignore lesser cover.

If your Strike with an alchemical bomb fails (but doesn't critically fail), you gain a +2 item bonus to the splash damage the target of the Strike takes.
