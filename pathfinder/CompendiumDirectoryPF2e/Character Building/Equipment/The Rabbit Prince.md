## Item 20
### [unique](unique "Unique Rarity Trait")[[artifact]][[harrow-court]][[invested]][[magical]]

* * *

_The Rabbit Prince_ represents the unreliability of hand-to-hand combat, and how even cunning foes can lose to lucky novices. As long as you have _The Rabbit Prince_ invested, it grants you a +1 status bonus to attack rolls you make as a readied action.

**Activate** `pf2:r` (fortune) envision

**Trigger** You miss a creature with a melee weapon Strike

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** Reroll the triggering Strike with a +1 status bonus. If you hit, attempt a `DC 15 Flat check`; on a failure, your weapon gains the broken condition (if your weapon is already broken, it's destroyed). If you're at least 14th level, this flat check is `DC 10 Flat check`. If you're at least 17th level, this flat check is `DC 5 Flat check`.
