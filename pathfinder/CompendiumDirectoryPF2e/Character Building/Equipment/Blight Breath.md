This foul-smelling bottle contains compressed, noxious fumes. After you inhale the odious gases of the _blight breath_, you gain resistance 10 to poison for as long as you hold your breath. You can exhale the _blight breath_ as a single action. The resulting spray of noxious fumes deals 10d6 poison damage to each creature in a 15-foot cone, with a `DC 29 Reflex check` save
