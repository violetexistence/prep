Performers popularized these bundles of aromatic herbs to calm the mind and ward off misfortune before a big show, though soldier bards have found them especially useful for clearing fear during particularly tumultuous battles. Adding this catalyst to a [[Spells/Soothe|Soothe]] spell also causes the spell to reduce the target's [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened]] condition value by 1.
