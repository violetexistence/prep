This crescent-shaped shard of iridescent metal is strangely translucent, fading to a blurry outline when examined for too long. A weapon under the effects of a _greater ethereal crescent_ gains the effects of an [[Equipment/Astral|Astral]] rune for 1 minute. This does not count against the weapon's normal maximum number of runes.
