# Jyoti's Feather (Greater)
## Item 14
### [[healing]][[magical]][[spellheart]][[vitality]]


**Price** 4100 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** affixed-to-armor-or-a-weapon

A jyoti's feather is a shimmering red-and-gold feather that seems almost metallic, although it's delicate and flexible to the touch. Though most aren't made from true jyoti feathers, as the reclusive outsiders avoid visitors from the Universe, the creatures' connection to life energy lent these spellhearts their name.

*   **Armor** You gain a +3 item bonus to saving throws against death effects and void energy.
*   **Weapon** The weapon has the [[Equipment/Vitalizing|Vitalizing]] rune while the _feather_ is affixed.
