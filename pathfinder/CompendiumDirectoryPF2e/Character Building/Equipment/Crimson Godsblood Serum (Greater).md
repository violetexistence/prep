Though it contains but a tiny drop of Gorum's blood, drinking this thick, swirling potion fills the user with divine wrath and resilience. While under the effect of the potion, you gain a +4 status bonus to physical damage rolls for 1 minute.

[[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Crimson Godsblood Serum|Effect: Crimson Godsblood Serum]]

The first time during that minute you're reduced to 0 Hit Points but not immediately killed, you avoid being knocked out, regain 6d8+20 healing Hit Points, and become [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]] for 1 round, and your [[Conditions/Wounded|Wounded]] condition increases by 1.
