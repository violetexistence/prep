Traditionally a favored weapon in Molthune for settling disputes between military leaders, the dancer's spear has seen a recent resurgence in popularity in the neighboring kingdom of Nirmathas, largely due to its effectiveness at striking down attacking skeletons and other undead from a relatively safe distance. A dancer's spear has a 7-foot-long wooden haft capped with a triangular metal blade at one end, counterbalanced on the other end with a reinforced metal sleeve that, in a pinch, can be used as an effective striking surface.
