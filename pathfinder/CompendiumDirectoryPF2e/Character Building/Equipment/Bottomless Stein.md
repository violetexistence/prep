# Bottomless Stein
## Item 2
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[magical]]


**Price** 25 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

A magic item regarded as holy by followers of Cayden Cailean, this ornate metallic stein is always filled to the brim with delicious ale, no matter how much is drunk or spilled. If it is emptied (such as by being gulped quickly or upended onto the floor), the _bottomless stein_ will fill again within 1 round as long as it is right side up, though it's impossible to transfer the ale to another container to sell it or store it for later. The exact type of ale with which the stein is filled is determined at the item's creation, and cannot be changed thereafter.
