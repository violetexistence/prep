These sets of rockets come in pairs and strap onto existing footwear (or a creature's feet). Inserting them and aligning them properly takes 1 minute. When you Activate the blast boots, you can [[Actions/High Jump|High Jump]] or [[Actions/Long Jump|Long Jump]], without the need to Stride first.

When you Activate the greater blast boots to High Jump, you can increase the vertical distance of your High Jump by up to 50 feet. When you Activate them to Long Jump, you can increase the horizontal distance of your Long Jump by up to 75 feet. Additionally, for 1 minute, the greater blast boots continue to boost your jumps. Every time you [[Actions/Leap|Leap]] during the duration, you can move 30 feet in any direction, or your normal Leap distance, whichever is further.
