# Masquerade Scarf
## Item 2
### [[invested]][[magical]]


**Price** 30 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** worn

This delicately embroidered scarf matches with every outfit and can even complete a costume or disguise with illusions.

* * *

**Activateâ€”Masquerade** 1 minute (manipulate)

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** You arrange the scarf over your lower face, and it casts a 1st-rank [[Spells/Illusory Disguise|Illusory Disguise]] spell on you, which ends immediately if the scarf is removed. You can alter the scarf's appearance or make it invisible as part of the _illusory disguise_, but it can still be felt if touched.
