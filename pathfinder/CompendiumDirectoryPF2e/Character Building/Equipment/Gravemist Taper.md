A _gravemist taper_ is a conical candle with symbols of terror and death carved into the wax. The taper can be used as a catalyst when casting a [[Spells/Mist|Mist]] spell, burning the taper away, coloring the mist gray, and filling the mist with ghastly, shadowy shapes. The flat check to overcome the [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] state from the mist rises to 7, and a creature who fails such a check becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]]. This aspect of the spell has the emotion, fear, and mental traits.
