An encounter with a toshigami, the enigmatic kami who protect cherry trees, is rare, though often sought after and treasured by those who achieve such an encounter. Only a handful of mortals can truthfully claim to have seen a toshigami, let alone met one, though many popular fireside tales tell of virtuous souls receiving a toshigami's blessing to fight for a worthy cause. Such stories have a basis in fact; every so often, a toshigami gives a worthy mortal a flower from their ward, time-locked in perfect bloom and granted sapience. Such _toshigami blossoms_ are more sociable than their creators. Like toshigami, a blossom has a strong curiosity about the mortal world. If you wear a _toshigami blossom_, it can intercede for you, helping you make a good impression.

A _toshigami blossom_ has the following activations.

* * *

**Activate** `pf2:2` (concentrate, manipulate)

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** The blossom casts [[Spells/Nature's Pathway|Nature's Pathway]] on you to your specifications. If you target only cherry trees, the spell is cast at 6th rank.

* * *

**Activate** `pf2:2` (concentrate)

**Frequency** once per hour

**Effect** The blossom casts [[Spells/Soothing Blossoms|Soothing Blossoms]] to your specifications.

* * *

**Activate** `pf2:1` (concentrate)

**Frequency** once per minute

**Effect** The blossom sends a flurry of cherry blossoms outward in a 20-foot burst that lasts 1 round. You and your allies can see through these blossoms. To all other creatures, creatures within the cloud of blossoms become [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]], and creatures outside the cloud become concealed to creatures within it. When you or an ally succeeds with a Strike against a creature in the blossoms, the Strike deals an additional 1d6 mental and an additional 1d6 void to living creatures, or an additional 1d6 vitality to undead.
