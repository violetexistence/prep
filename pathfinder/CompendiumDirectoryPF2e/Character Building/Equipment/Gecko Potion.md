A _gecko potion_ is a sticky, tawny brown liquid with flecks of sand suspended in it. For 5 minutes after drinking this potion, your fingertips sprout thousands of microscopic, bristled hairs that cling to objects, granting you gain a +1 item bonus to [[Actions/Climb|Climb]] and [[Actions/Palm an Object|Palm an Object]] checks and to your Reflex DC against [[Actions/Disarm|Disarm]] attempts.
