When lit, this black candle's eerie blue flame reveals the presence of [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]] creatures. Within a 10-foot radius of the lit candle, creatures don't benefit from the invisible condition. Their bodies are outlined, not fully visible, so they're [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]]. Once lit, the candle burns for 1 minute, after which the effect ends. If extinguished, it can't be relit.
