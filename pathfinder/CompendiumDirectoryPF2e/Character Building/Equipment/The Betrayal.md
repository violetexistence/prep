_The Betrayal_ represents selfishness and envy, twisting outcomes toward unfavorable or even devastating results. As long as _The Betrayal_ is invested, you become more adept at hiding who you really are and tricking targets into positions of vulnerability. You gain a +2 item bonus on Deception checks made to [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] or [[Actions/Feint|Feint]]. This increases to a +3 bonus if you are at least 17th level.

**Activate** `pf2:0` envision

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You turn the tables on your foes, bringing one of them into your ranks and compelling them to attack their allies. You cast [[Spells/Dominate|Dominate]] on a creature, but can only issue commands to attack or otherwise harm, betray, or inconvenience its allies. The rank of the spell is one-half your level, rounded down (minimum 6th level), and the save DC is your class DC (`Will check`).
