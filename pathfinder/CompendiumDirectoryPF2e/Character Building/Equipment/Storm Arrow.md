# Storm Arrow
## Item 9
### [[air]][[consumable]][[electricity]][[magical]]

**Category** ammo; 
**Price** 130 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

* * *

The head of this arrow is made from gleaming copper.

When an activated _storm arrow_ hits a target, it is buffeted by raging winds and struck by a bolt of lightning that deals 3d12 electricity damage and the target must attempt a `DC 25 Reflex check` saving throw. If this arrow is shot from a weapon with a _shock_ property rune, the save DC increases to 27, though the attack doesn't benefit from the _shock_ property rune itself.

* * *

**Critical Success** The foe is unaffected.

**Success** The foe takes half damage and isn't affected by the wind.

**Failure** The foe takes full damage and is buffeted by winds for 1 round, taking a -2 circumstance penalty to ranged attack rolls and a -10-foot circumstance penalty to its fly Speed.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the foe takes double damage.
