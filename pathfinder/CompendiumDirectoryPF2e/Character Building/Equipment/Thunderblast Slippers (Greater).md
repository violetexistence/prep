**Activate** `pf2:2` (concentrate, manipulate)

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** You move like the wind, with precision and speed. You Stride up to 120 feet; this movement doesn't trigger reactions. When you stop, if you've moved at least 30 feet from where you started, you release a thunderous 5-foot emanation that deals 3d6 bludgeoning damage and 3d6 sonic damage with a `DC 34 Fortitude check`. A creature that critically fails its save is also knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]].
