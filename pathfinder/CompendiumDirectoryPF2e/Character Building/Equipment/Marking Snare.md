# Marking Snare
## Item 1
### [[consumable]][[mechanical]][[snare]][[trap]]

**Category** snare; 
**Price** 3 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

This snare is often used to mark intruders for later tracking or identification. When you create this snare, you must decide whether to make it a dye or a scent marker. Either type of marking grants a +2 circumstance bonus to [[Actions/Track|Track]] the creature for up to 24 hours or until the dye or scent is washed off (requiring at least a gallon of water and 10 minutes of scrubbing). A creature that enters a square of the snare must attempt a `DC 17 Reflex check` save.

**Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Failure** The snare marks the creature.

**Critical Failure** The snare marks the creature, and the creature is [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] until the end of its next turn.
