# Grail of Twisted Desires
## Item 10
### [unique](unique "Unique Rarity Trait")[[illusion]][[magical]]


**Price** 850 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

This timeworn chalice is constructed of dull tin. It has an unassuming appearance save for the gold, silver, and ebony rings that encircle its rim.

**Activate** `pf2:1` envision

**Frequency** three times per day

* * *

**Effect** The chalice fills with one of three different wines of your choosing, as described below. The wine looks, tastes, and smells the same regardless of which type you choose, and [[Spells/Detect Magic|Detect Magic]] has no effect on the liquid beyond indicating that it is magical.

*   Ordinary wine.
*   Wine that, when imbibed, casts a 2nd-rank [[Spells/Restoration|Restoration]] spell on the drinker.
*   Wine that, when imbibed, casts a 4th-rank [[Spells/Nightmare|Nightmare]] spell on the drinker.

If you aren't chaotic, the first time each day you activate the chalice, there is a one-in-six chance that the liquid you conjure is a different type (the GM should roll 1d6 as a secret roll) instead. The second and third times you activate the chalice in the same day, the odds of this happening increase to two-in-six or three-in-six, respectively. If you are chaotic, the chalice always works as intended.
