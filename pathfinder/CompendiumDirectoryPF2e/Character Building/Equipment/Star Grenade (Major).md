These unusual gunpowder bombs, typically marked with a symbol of a four-pointed star on their outer surface, explode outward in the shape of a cross whenever they Strike a target. When you throw a star grenade, arrange two perpendicular 25-foot lines over the target, both centered on the target and moving straight through the target, not diagonally. Creatures other than the target within these two lines take splash damage (typically 8 squares take splash damage for a Medium creature). Any effect that alters or adjusts the splash area's shape or size, like the alchemist feat Expanded Splash, doesn't apply to star grenades.

You gain a +3 item bonus to attack rolls. The bomb deals 4d8 fire damage and 4 splash Damage.
