**Effect** You throw the captivating rosebud in a square adjacent to you. The rosebud quickly sprouts into a little rosebush that lasts for 1 hour. Any creature that passes within 15 feet of the rose bush, other than yourself, must attempt a `DC 18 Will check` save.

**Effect** You plant the captivating rosebud into a square adjacent to a building or other structure. It grows into a rosebush that stretches up to 30 feet tall. You and your allies can use the rosebush as a ladder to Climb easily up and down the side of the adjacent structure, but all other creatures must succeed at a `DC 17 Will check` saving throw or fail to notice the rosebush's presence.
