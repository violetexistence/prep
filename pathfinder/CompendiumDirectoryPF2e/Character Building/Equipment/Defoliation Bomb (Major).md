This brightly painted ceramic sphere contains chemicals that cause plants to wither and die. You gain a +3 item bonus to attack rolls. A defoliation bomb deals the 4d6 void damage, 4d4 persistent void damage, and 4 void splash damage to all plants in the area. Non-creature plants in the area immediately wither and die.
