# Stalker Bane Snare
## Item 4
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[consumable]][[magical]][[snare]][[trap]]

**Category** snare; 
**Price** 15 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

This snare explodes in a burst of cloying powder that can cling to a creature stepping into its square. A creature that enters the square of a stalker bane snare must attempt a `DC 20 Reflex check` save.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** Powder sticks to the target, causing it to leave behind telltale footprints. Being [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]] makes the target [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]], rather than [[Conditions/Undetected|Undetected]], to creatures that could see it if it weren't invisible.

**Failure** Powder clumps on the target, constantly flaking away. Being invisible makes the target [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]], rather than hidden or undetected, to creatures that could see it if it weren't invisible.

**Critical Failure** As failure, and the creature is [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] until the end of its next turn.
