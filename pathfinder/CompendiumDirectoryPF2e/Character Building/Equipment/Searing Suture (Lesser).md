Activating this black powder-infused alchemical bandage cauterizes wounds. You can apply a searing suture to yourself or an adjacent willing creature as you activate it. The target creature takes 1d6 fire damage and can immediately attempt a `DC 15 Flat check` to remove the persistent bleed damage. When applied against a bleed effect that is lower level than the searing suture, the flat check is automatically successful.
