# Pristine Epaulets
## Item 5
### [[fortune]][[invested]][[magical]]


**Price** 125 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** worn

Gaudy and sparkling, these intricately decorated epaulets have clearly never seen a battlefield. Worn by officers with more schooling or connections than actual fighting experience, these epaulets grant you a +1 item bonus to Society and Warfare Lore checks.

**Activateâ€”I Meant to Say** `pf2:r` (concentrate, fortune)

**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** You critically fail a Diplomacy check

* * *

**Effect** The pristine epaulets are often worn to both tense military negotiations and social events and can help you recover from a misstep. You can reroll the check, but you must take the new result.
