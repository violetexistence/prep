# False Death
## Item 5
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[alchemical]][[consumable]][[ingested]][[poison]]

**Category** poison; 
**Price** 25 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

Typically used to fake one's death, this poison swiftly causes the imbiber to lose consciousness and suppresses vital signs. A creature examining the unconscious target must succeed at a Medicine check against the imbiber's Deception DC + 4 to determine that the target is alive, and a critical success allows the examiner to determine that a toxin is causing the effect. The false death toxin has an extremely bitter taste (`DC 10 Perception check` to detect), making it difficult to trick a creature into consuming the poison against its wishes.
