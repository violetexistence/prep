### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")


**Price** 40 gp;

This specialized [[Equipment/Grappling Gun (Clockwork)|Grappling Gun (Clockwork)]], which attaches to your wrist, connects to a spool of 50 feet of thin metal cord attached to a pack on your back. The wrist grappler and pack are small enough that they can be concealed with a loose jacket or similar piece of clothing. You can deploy or stow the gun from the attached wrist device with an Interact action. Reloading a clockwork wrist grappler uses the same process as reloading a clockwork grappling gun and takes 3 actions.
