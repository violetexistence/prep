* * *

An undead scourge is a _+1 striking vitalizing dagger_ with a bluish-white metal blade that emits a faint glow. These used to be weapons of Pharasmin undead slayers only, but the slayers have since shared the secrets of their creation with the Knights of Lastwall.

**Activateâ€”Sever from the Void** `pf2:0` (concentrate, divine, vitality)

**Frequency** once per hour

**Trigger** You hit and damage an undead creature with an undead scourge

**Effect** You disrupt the undead's connection to void energy. For 1 minute, the undead damaged with the dagger can't be healed by void energy unless the effect attempting to heal the undead first counteracts the undead scourge's effect, which has a counteract rank of 4th and a DC of 25. Vitality energy still has the usual effects on the undead.
