# Setup Snare
## Item 3
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[consumable]][[kobold]][[mechanical]][[snare]][[trap]]

**Category** snare; 
**Price** 8 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** other

This snare is designed to divert a target's movement towards another snare or hazard. You may choose to have the target attempt a Will saving throw instead of a Reflex saving throw; if you do, add the fear and mental traits plus add either the visual or auditory trait.

When a Small or larger creature enters the square, the snare Pushes the creature 5 feet and the target becomes [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] until the end of their next turn. On a critical failure the snare Pushes the target 10 feet and the target becomes [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 2]] until the end of their next turn.
