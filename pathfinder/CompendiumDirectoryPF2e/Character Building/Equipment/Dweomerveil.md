This soft covering for the mouth and nose is made from the sleek fur of a dweomercat and is fastened with two gnarled teeth of the same beast. Each day during daily preparations, you must brush and oil the veil. At the conclusion of the activity, select one tradition of magic (arcane, divine, occult, or primal). You gain a +1 item bonus to all saves against magic from that tradition until your next daily preparations.
