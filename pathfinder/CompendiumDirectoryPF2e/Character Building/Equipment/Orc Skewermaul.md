As dwarves poured out of the Darklands following their Quest for Sky, the orcs driven before them adapted to their tacticsâ€”including dwarves' heavily armored infantry charges. Surviving orcs developed a response: a weapon that combines a spear and maul to crush heavy armor and skewer charging foes. Although rarely seen today, the weapon is remarkably effective in the right situation.
