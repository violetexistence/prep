# Fan of Falling Words
## Item 10
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[magical]]


**Price** 900 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

This folding handheld paper fan appears blank when first found, but if the wielder unfolds its leaves as an Interact action, they display an ink-brush painting of the wielder's choice. The fan must be closed and opened again to display a different painting. While held, the _fan of falling words_ grants you a +2 item bonus to Performance checks to act or perform comedy, orate, or sing.

**Activate** `pf2:1` command, Interact

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** You manifest the tapestry of your words, causing the image you depict on the fan to leap off its leaves. The fan casts [[Spells/Mirage|Mirage]] to your specifications (`DC 27 Will check` save to disbelieve). While this only takes three actions to perform (as opposed to the spell's normal 10 minutes of casting), the effect has no range, and the 50-foot burst it creates is centered on you.
