Performers and criminals are both known to use disposable clothing designed to be torn off the body quickly and easily. This garment is loose enough to be worn over another outfit, including light armor. You can remove tear-away clothing with an Interact action. The price for tear-away clothing is to modify an existing outfit. If purchasing a new outfit, add the tear-away clothing's price to the outfit to modify it as part of the purchase.
