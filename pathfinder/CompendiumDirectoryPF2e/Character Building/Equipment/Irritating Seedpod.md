When you crack open this soft, spongy seedpod, you can use it as a catalyst when casting a [[Spells/Mist|Mist]] spell. When you do, irritating pollen fills the area for the spell's duration. Creatures in the area must attempt a `DC 21 Fortitude check` saving throw to avoid sneezing uncontrollably. On a failed save, the creature becomes [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] for 1 round. A creature that succeeds at this saving throw becomes temporarily immune to the irritating seedpod's pollen for 10 minutes.
