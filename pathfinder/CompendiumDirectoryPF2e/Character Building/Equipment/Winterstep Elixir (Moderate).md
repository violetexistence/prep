This frigid white elixir widens your feet and lightens your steps, enabling you to walk across ice and snow without difficulty. You ignore the uneven ground and difficult terrain caused by ice, and the difficult terrain caused by snow (reducing greater difficult terrain caused by ice or snow to ordinary difficult terrain). The duration is 1 hour.
