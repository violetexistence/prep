The tip of this arrow is carved into the shape of a lidless eye. When an activated scouting arrow strikes a surface within the second range increment of the weapon it was fired from, the wielder of that weapon can [[Actions/Seek|Seek]] as though they were at the point of impact of the arrow using their normal senses. After this glimpse, the ammunition crumbles to ash.
