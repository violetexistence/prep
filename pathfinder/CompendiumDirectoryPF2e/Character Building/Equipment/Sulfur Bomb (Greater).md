A thick, sulfurous, irritating gas fills this golden-yellow flask. You gain a +2 item bonus to attack rolls. The bomb deals 3d4 acid damage and 3 acid splash damage. On a hit, the target takes a -1 status penalty to Perception checks and attack rolls until the end of its next turn, or becomes [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] on a critical hit. Creatures hit with this bomb are temporarily immune to the effects of the bomb for 1 minute.
