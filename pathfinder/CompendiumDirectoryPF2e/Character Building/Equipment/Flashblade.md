| **Bulk** 2 | **Size** med |

A sleek and impossibly lightweight blade attached to a haft scriven with lightning bolts make up this _+1 striking nodachi_.

**Activateâ€”Prepare Flash** `pf2:2` (concentrate)

**Frequency** once per 10 minutes

* * *

**Effect** You concentrate with complete focus on your surroundings, breathing in the flashblade's magic to make you lighter and faster, and the blade of your sword more flexible. You Ready a melee Strike, increasing the flashblade's reach for that Strike to 15 feet. If the trigger doesn't occur, this doesn't count against the flashblade's frequency.
