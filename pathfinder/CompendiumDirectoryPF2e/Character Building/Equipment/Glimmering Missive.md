A glimmering missive sparkles as you compose it. When activated, it explodes, disintegrating into a shower of multicolored motes in a 10-foot burst from a corner of the missive's space. Creatures in the area are covered in sparkling dust that remains luminous for 1 hour. Visible creatures can't be [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] while covered by the luminous dust; any [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]] creatures are concealed while covered in the luminous dust, rather than being undetected.
