# Golden Gloves
## Item 19
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[apex]][[holy]][[invested]][[magical]]


**Price** 40000 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** worngloves

These golden-threaded gloves fit snuggly past the elbows, and imbue all other worn clothing with an aristocratic mien. The gloves grant you a +3 item bonus to Society skill checks. When you invest the gloves, you either increase your Intelligence score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever would give you a higher score. This gives you additional trained skills and languages, as normal for increasing your Intelligence modifier. You must select skills and languages the first time you invest the gloves, and whenever you invest the same _golden gloves_, you get the same skills and languages you chose the first time. If you are unholy, you become [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 2]] when invested in these gloves.

**Activate—Heaven's Wings** `pf2:2` (manipulate, visual)

**Frequency** once per hour

**Effect** You throw wide your arms, putting the _golden gloves_ on full display and causing a blazing halo to form above your head. All enemies within a 40-feet emanation must make a `DC 41 Fortitude check` save or be [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] for 1 minute (or [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] for 1 minute on critical failure). Unholy creatures take a –2 item penalty to their roll. The halo then melts into your body and attempts to counteract any one affliction you are currently suffering of your choice with a counteract rank of 9 and a counteract modifier of +31.
