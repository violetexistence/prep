# Weapon Shot (Major)
## Item 16
### [[consumable]][[magical]]

**Category** ammo; 
**Price** 2000 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** other

**Ammunition** any

The body of a _weapon shot_ is translucent and filled with quicksilver. It imparts its magic to the weapon used to fire it or it summons a translucent weapon, made of force, to fire it. It's a favorite of killers and sharpshooters who need just one shot in a situation where carrying ammunition is easier than carrying a weapon.

**Activate** `pf2:1` (concentrate)

* * *

**Effect** For the Strike with which you consume the ammunition, the weapon is a _+3 greater striking weapon_, instead of those of the weapon firing it.

**Activate** `pf2:2` (concentrate, manipulate)

* * *

**Effect** A ghostly weapon made of force appears, wielded by you and loaded with the _weapon shot_ you activated. The conjured weapon sublimates into motes of briefly luminous dust if the _weapon shot_ deactivates without you using it or just after you use the activated shot. For the Strike with which it functions, the weapon is a _+3 greater striking weapon_.
