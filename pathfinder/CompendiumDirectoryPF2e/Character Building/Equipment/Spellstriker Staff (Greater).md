A _spellstriker staff_ is wrought iron with gleaming arcane sigils etched into its surface and a sharp point at the bottom. Used as a weapon, the staff is a _+2 striking shifting staff_.

* * *

**Activate** `pf2:0` (concentrate)

**Frequency** once per hour

**Trigger** You use Spellstrike with a non-cantrip spell and miss with the Strike

* * *

**Effect** An explosion of magical energy—stored up for the Spellstrike—explodes out. All creatures in a 5-foot emanation take 1d6 damage per rank of the spell, with a `Reflex check` save against your spell DC. This damage is the same type the spell would have dealt, and the activation gains that trait; if the spell would have dealt multiple types of damage, choose one of them. If the damage of the explosion is mental, the save is `Will check` instead of Reflex.

* * *

**Activate** Cast a Spell

**Effect** You expend a number of charges from the staff to cast a spell from its list.

*   **Cantrip** [[Spells/Ignition|Ignition]]
*   **1st** [[Spells/Echoing Weapon|Echoing Weapon]], [[Spells/Sure Strike|Sure Strike]]
*   **2nd** [[Spells/Acid Grip|Acid Grip]], [[Spells/Telekinetic Maneuver|Telekinetic Maneuver]]
*   **3rd** [[Spells/Echoing Weapon|Echoing Weapon]], [[Spells/Haste|Haste]]
*   **4th** [[Spells/Acid Grip|Acid Grip]], [[Spells/Weapon Storm|Weapon Storm]]
