This oversized greataxe, infamous for the chilling laughter it emits whenever it takes a life, was crafted by the frost giant sorcerer Jorngarl from the final blade named Toothy Morris after it was stolen in an attack on a Gray Gardener convoy. It functions as a _+3 major striking vorpal greataxe_ that retains the unique properties of a [[Equipment/Final Blade|Final Blade]], trapping the souls of any it slays and preventing them from being returned to life by any means short of divine intervention, even a [[Spells/Wish|Wish]] ritual or similar magic.
