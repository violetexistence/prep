# Hide Shield

### [[deflecting-bludgeoning]]


**Price** 2 gp; 
**Bulk** 1; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

Hide shields come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Specialized tanning techniques combined with tough hides from creatures such as owlbears result in these particularly tough shields. The hardened hide of the shield still has enough flexibility to diminish the impact of battering and pummeling attacks.
