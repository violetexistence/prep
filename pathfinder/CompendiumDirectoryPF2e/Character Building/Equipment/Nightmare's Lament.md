Ritually constructed from the bones of a nightmare, a _nightmare's lament_ is a _+1 striking rapier pistol_. Thin wisps of dark smoke continually surround the red-flecked blade.

**Activateâ€”Fuming Cloak** `pf2:2` (manipulate)

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** For 1 minute, the _nightmare's lament_ continually vents thick, black smoke that creates concealment in a 15-foot aura around the gun's wielder. The wielder of the _nightmare's lament_ can see through this smoke. A creature that begins its turn in the area becomes [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]] (`DC 23 Fortitude check` negates) and is then temporarily immune to the sickness from the smoke for 1 minute. The wielder of the _nightmare's lament_, any creature currently holding its breath (or that does not need to breathe), and any creature immune to poison are immune to the aura's sickened effect but not the concealment.
