# Aluum Charm
## Item 10
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[invested]][[magical]]


**Price** 0 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** worn

This ornate pendant of brass is adorned with a vibrant blue gemstone. An _aluum charm_ grants control over a particular aluum and lesser influence over other such constructs. As long as you wear an aluum's linked _aluum charm_, that aluum follows your verbal commands, including somewhat nuanced orders like "subdue this target" or "strike anyone wearing a blue robe."

**Activate** `pf2:2` command

**Frequency** once per round

* * *

**Effect** The charm grants you control over an aluum you can see within 60 feet, with a level equal to or lower than the charm. This has the effect of [[Spells/Dominate|Dominate]] and allows a `DC 28 Will check` save. If the aluum is currently under the control of someone wearing its linked charm, it gets a result on its saving throw one degree higher than what it rolled.

You can control only one aluum at a time using this activation, and controlling a new aluum ends the effect for one you had previously affected.
