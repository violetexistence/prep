### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[divine]][[magical]]


**Price** 14000 gp;

**Usage** worncloak

The fabric of a _cultist cowl_ is either raspy burlap, durable cotton, or fine silk, depending on the item's power (and thus the implied import of the worshipper who wears it). When a character who worships a single deity dons a _cultist cowl_, the cowl's colors change to match those sacred to that deity, and the deity's symbol or rune appears on the lower front of the cowl that hangs just over the chest. These colors and symbols remain until a different worshipper wears the cowl. While worn, you gain a +3 item bonus to Religion checks. You also gain a +3 item bonus to all skill checks attempted to aid a ritual by being a secondary caster.

**Activate** `pf2:2` envision, command

**Frequency** once per hour

**Effect** The cowl casts [[Spells/Crisis of Faith|Crisis of Faith]] (`DC 37 Will check`) heightened to 7th-rank to your specification.
