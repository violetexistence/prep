# Unbreakable Heart
## Item 3
### [[invested]][[magical]][[tattoo]]


**Price** 60 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** tattooed-on-the-body

The name of your beloved adorns this stylized image of a heart. An unbreakable heart tattoo can be received only at the end of a successful [[Spells/Heartbond|Heartbond]] ritual, serving as your token. The other participant can have a token other than a tattoo if they wish. If you have more than one _heartbond_, each unbreakable heart you have serves as a token for only one of them. The love exuding from you grants you a +1 item bonus to Diplomacy checks. When you use _heartbond_'s activity to learn your beloved's present state, you can also grant them a small gift, choosing from the following options each time. Make your choice after learning their state.

*   Your beloved gains 5 temporary Hit Points that last for 10 minutes.
*   The tattoo casts [[Spells/Guidance|Guidance]] on your beloved.
*   The tattoo casts [[Spells/Stabilize|Stabilize]] on your beloved.
*   The tattoo casts [[Spells/Light|Light]] on your beloved's token from _heartbond_
