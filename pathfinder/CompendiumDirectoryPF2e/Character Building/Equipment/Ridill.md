This 12-foot sword was made by a cyclops in the ancient past. It might be the greatest dragon-killing weapon ever made, and Fafnheir justly fears it, which is why he keeps it hidden in his hoard. Runes of dragon slaying are written down its blade. _Ridill_ is a _+3 major striking dragon bane speed adamantine greatsword_. While wielding _Ridill_, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saves against fear. This increases to +4 if the effect is from a dragon. If you have an ability that depends on Large weapons (such as barbarian giant instinct), it works with _Ridill_.

_Ridill_ is always considered to have the appropriate material or damage type necessary to deactivate a dragon's regeneration or cause the dragon's weakness to apply. For example, _Ridill_ is considered to be cold iron when attacking a linnorm, while it would be treated as having dealt cold damage when attacking a red dragon. If the dragon has more than one weakness, only the highest value applies.

**Destruction** If you boil _Ridill_ in the blood of 10 different types of dragon (blue dragon, red dragon, etc.) and drop the eye of a cyclops seer into the brew, _Ridill_ melts away into nothingness.
