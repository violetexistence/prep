## Item 20
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[invested]][[magical]]


**Price** 67000 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** worn

This golden ring has three diamonds set into its face.

**Activate** `pf2:r` envision

**Trigger** You are targeted by a spell

* * *

**Effect** The ring replicates the effects of an 8th-rank [[Spells/Spell Turning|Spell Turning]] with a counteract modifier of 1d20+35, possibly causing the triggering spell to reflect back on its caster.

The ring can reflect no more than 9 total ranks of spells per day. If you activate the ring to reflect a spell that would exceed this limit, the attempt fails, but the attempted usage of the ring does not count toward the daily limit.
