# Eye Slash (True)
## Item 17
### [[invested]][[magical]][[tattoo]]


**Price** 15000 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** tattooed-on-the-body

Small scars or marks around your eye improve your distant vision. These scars are especially common among orc scouts, who favor scars shaped like eagle talons. You can see four times farther than normal. If you have darkvision, you can see blood in color. Higher-level versions of an eye slash are larger and more elaborate scars or marks, radiating out around the eye.

The tattoo also grants you a +3 item bonus to Perception checks that involve sight.
