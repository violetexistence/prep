Carved of ash wood and decorated with images of clouds and gusting winds, a _windstep sheath_ is a small icon shaped like a weapon sheath or quiver. This whetstone is favored by duelists who like to take their foe by surprise. When you use the [[Feats/Quick Draw|Quick Draw]] feat with a weapon under the effect of a _windstep sheath_, you can also Step as part of that action, either immediately before or after your Strike.
