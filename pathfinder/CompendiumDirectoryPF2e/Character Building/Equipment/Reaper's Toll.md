This _+2 greater striking decaying scythe_ is deathly cold to the touch and exudes an unmistakable aura of menace. As long as you carry this weapon, your presence repels and noticeably unnerves most animals, causing them to avoid you if possible and react to you with a starting attitude one step worse than normal if made to interact with you directly. The one exception is vermin who scavenge corpses; they appear around you with greater frequency. Small mundane plants, such as grass or flowers, wilt and die after spending 24 hours in close proximity to a reaper's toll, crumbling to dust 24 hours after that.
