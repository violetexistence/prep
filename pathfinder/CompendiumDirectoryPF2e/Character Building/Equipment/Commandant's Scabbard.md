# Commandant's Scabbard
## Item 17
### [[apex]][[invested]][[magical]]


**Price** 15000 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** worn

Only the leader of an army could wear this diamond and ruby-encrusted scabbard that somehow always remains shiny no matter how terrible the conditions. While wearing the scabbard, you feel exceptionally powerful, and you gain a +3 item bonus to Athletics checks.

When you invest the scabbard, you either increase your Strength modifier by 1 or increase it to +4, whichever would give you a higher value. The commandant's scabbard holds one melee weapon of 1 Bulk or lighter. Whenever a weapon is drawn from the scabbard, it gains a +4 status bonus to damage for 1 round.
