_The Cyclone_ represents tumultuous evil plots. As long as it is invested, _The Cyclone_ bolsters you with helpful winds that grant you a +2 item bonus to Athletics checks made to [[Actions/Climb|Climb]], [[Actions/High Jump|High Jump]], [[Actions/Long Jump|Long Jump]], and [[Actions/Disarm|Disarm]]. This increases to a +3 item bonus if you are at least 17th level.

**Activate** `pf2:2` envision, Interact

**Effect** You cast [[Spells/Whirlwind|Whirlwind]]. You do not treat the squares in the whirlwind as difficult terrain, but all other creatures do. The rank of the spell is one-half your level, rounded down (minimum 8th rank), and the save DC is your class DC or spell DC (`Reflex check`).
