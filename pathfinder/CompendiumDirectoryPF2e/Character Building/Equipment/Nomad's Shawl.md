# Nomad's Shawl
## Item 7
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[invested]][[magical]]


**Price** 330 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** worn

The intricate beading of this shawl subtly guides you. While you wear the shawl, you always know which direction is north and gain a +1 item bonus to Survival checks.

**Activateâ€”Mind's Map** `pf2:1` (concentrate)

You focus your mind's eye on a location you've been to previously. The beads on the shawl shift colors to create a map of the area based on your memories. You can dismiss this effect as a free action.
