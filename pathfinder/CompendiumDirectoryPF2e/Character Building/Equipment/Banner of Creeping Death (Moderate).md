# Banner of Creeping Death (Moderate)
## Item 9
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[aura]][[magical]]


**Price** 750 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** affixed-or-held-in-one-hand

The very fabric of this off-putting magical banner seems to be rotting with a slick, foul texture. Traditionally, these banners were created from the uniforms of fallen enemy troops, but this is considered a cruel and dishonorable practice by many modern nations. While holding a banner of creeping death, you can use the following ability.

**Activateâ€”Void's Embrace** `pf2:1` (concentrate, void)

**Frequency** once per minute

* * *

**Effect** A massive wave of void energy floods out from the banner in all directions. All living creatures within the banner's aura take 2d4+2 void damage (`DC 26 Fortitude check` save).
