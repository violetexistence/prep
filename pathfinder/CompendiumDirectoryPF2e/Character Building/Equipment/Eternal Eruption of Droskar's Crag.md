# Eternal Eruption of Droskar's Crag
## Item 13
### [[fire]][[magical]]


**Price** 3000 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

Resembling _frozen lava_, an eternal eruption is made with the same type of time magic, but is built to loop through time, reforming itself after it's used. Determining the difference between the two requires a close examination to see a faint, repeating pattern of red runes.

**Activateâ€”Lava Bomb** `pf2:2` (concentrate, manipulate)

* * *

**Effect** You fling the _eternal eruption_, with the effect of _[[Equipment/Frozen Lava of Droskar's Crag|Frozen Lava of Droskar's Crag]]_. After 2d4 hours, the _eternal eruption_ reforms itself in a container on your person, typically the one you most recently stored it in.

_Eternal Eruption of Droskar's Crag_ deals 13d6 fire on a `DC 32 Reflex check`.
