A _ghast stiletto_ is a _+1 dagger_ wrapped in the still-undead skin of a ghast. While you wield the dagger, you gain a +1 status bonus to all saves against paralysis.

**Activate** `pf2:1` command, Interact (divine, necromancy, olfactory)

**Frequency** once per hour

**Effect** The ghast stiletto afflicts the next living target struck by the dagger with a terrible wound that emits the foul stench of the grave. For the next minute, the target creature, as well as any creatures within a 10-foot emanation, must succeed at a `DC 16 Fortitude check` save or become [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] (plus [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] as long as it's sickened on a critical failure). While within the emanation, the creature takes a â€“2 circumstance penalty to saves against disease and to recover from the sickened condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune for 1 minute.

**Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials must include skin from a ghast.
