This yellow fruit's soft flesh is covered by waxy, fibrous leaves reminiscent of a pineapple. When you eat an apricot of bestial might, you transform into a boar-faced battle form with scaly skin. You can use feats with this item as if it were a bestial mutagen, improving your tusk unarmed attack as if it were a claw or jaws attack.

**Benefit** You gain 8 resistance to all physical damage and gain a tusk unarmed attack with the deadly d12 trait that deals 1d10 piercing damage.

**Drawback** You become [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]]. If you perform an action with the auditory or linguistic traits, you must succeed at a `DC 5 Flat check` or the action is lost.
