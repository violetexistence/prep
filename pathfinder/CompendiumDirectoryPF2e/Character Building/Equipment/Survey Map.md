Maps are uncommon. Most maps you can find are simple and functional. A survey map details a single location in excellent detail. One of these maps gives you a +1 item bonus to Survival checks and any skill checks to Recall Knowledge, provided the checks are related to the location detailed on the map. The GM determines what maps are available in any location.
