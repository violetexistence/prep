This metal arrowhead is sharp at the tip but never draws the blood of its user. When you attempt a ranged Strike with a weapon under the effect of a _pinpoint arrowhead_, you treat any cover the target has as one degree less (for example, treat standard cover as lesser cover, and lesser cover as no cover).
