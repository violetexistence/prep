### [[divine]][[holy]][[invested]][[noisy]]

**Category** medium; **Group** chain
**Price** 2500 gp; 
**Bulk** 1; **Size** med
**Usage** wornarmor

This suit of _+2 resilient chain mail_ is made of fine white links of a strange and slightly translucent pale metal, and the sleeves and skirt are fashioned into smaller trails that resemble feathers. Unlike normal chain mail, _holy chain_ has no Speed reduction, its armor check penalty is 0, and its Bulk is 1.

You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC and saving throws against fiends. You appear radiant while you wear the armor, giving you a +2 item bonus to Diplomacy checks against all creatures except fiends.

If you're unholy, you're [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 2]] while wearing _holy chain_. You can't recover from this condition while wearing the armor.

**Effect** The armor sprouts glowing wings that grant you a fly Speed of 30 feet. The wings shed bright light in a 40-foot radius (and dim light to the next 40 feet). The wings fade away after 10 minutes.
