# Semaphore of Slanders
## Item 11
### [[magical]]


**Price** 1250 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-two-hands

This semaphore set consists of two hardwood poles painted white, with finely crafted silk flags bisected by yellow and red fields. A tiny stylized black serpent with its tongue extended is depicted on the top outer corner of each flag. The semaphore of slanders, in addition to being a functioning semaphore set, can be used to send false signals to any enemy forces observing the signaler, providing a +2 item bonus to Deception checks to do so, and allies are always aware of this ruse.
