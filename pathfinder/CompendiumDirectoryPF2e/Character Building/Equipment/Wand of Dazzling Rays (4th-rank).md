# Wand of Dazzling Rays (4th-rank)
## Item 10
### [[fire]][[holy]][[light]][[magical]][[wand]]

**Category** wand; 
**Price** 1000 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

Solidified radiance comprises this slender, featureless wand. It sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for the next 20 feet. After you Activate the wand, the light fades, so it only sheds dim light in a 20-foot radius. The wand returns to its original brightness each dawn.

**Activate** Cast a Spell

**Frequency** once per day, plus overcharge

**Effect** You cast 4th-rank [[Spells/Holy Light|Holy Light]], dazzling your target with the beam's intensity. A creature that takes damage from the spell is [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] for 1 round and [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] for a number of rounds equal to the spell rank. On a critical success on the attack roll, the target is also blinded for as long as it's dazzled from the spell. However, it can attempt a `Fortitude check` saving throw against your spell DC at the end of each of its turns, ending the blinded condition on a success (but remaining dazzled).

* * *

**Craft Requirements** Supply a casting of _holy light_ of the appropriate rank.
