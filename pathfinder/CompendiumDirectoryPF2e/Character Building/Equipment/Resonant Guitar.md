Every part of this dark, shining guitar, from the strings to the soundboard, is constructed of metal. When the strings are strummed, the gilding on the guitar ripples like a liquid. A _resonant guitar_ is a virtuoso handheld musical instrument that grants a +2 item bonus to Performance checks attempted while using it.

A _resonant guitar_ is a planar key for [[Spells/Interplanar Teleport|Interplanar Teleport]] and similar magic to travel to the Plane of Metal. When using it in this way, you can play a tune inspired by your destination to make it more likely to arrive where you intend to be, appearing 1d6×25 miles from your intended destination instead of 1d10×25 miles away.
