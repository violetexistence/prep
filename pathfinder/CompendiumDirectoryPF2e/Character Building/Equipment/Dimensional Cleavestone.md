# Dimensional Cleavestone
## Item 14
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[consumable]][[magical]][[whetstone]]

**Category** other; 
**Price** 900 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

The edges of this irregular hunk of obsidian seem to shimmer. While wielding a weapon under the effect of a _dimensional cleavestone_, you gain the Tear Rift action for 1 minute.

**Tear Rift** `pf2:2` (magical, manipulate, teleportation)

* * *

You carve a rent in space in an adjacent square, choosing another square within 30 feet to connect with your rift. A visible slash appears in both locations, displaying the view from the other side.

Until the end of your next turn, these two squares are treated as adjacent to each other; for example, creatures could Stride or be Shoved through the rifts to their other side, and a creature adjacent to one rift can Strike a creature adjacent to the other.

When Tearing a Rift, you can choose to Step through the rift as part of the activity. The rifts don't automatically pull creatures or objects through, as they take up only a small amount of space within the square, and a creature sharing a space with a rift is unaffected except for determining adjacency. You can have only one rift active at a time.
