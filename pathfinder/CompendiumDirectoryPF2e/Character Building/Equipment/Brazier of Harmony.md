# Brazier of Harmony
## Item 5
### [[censer]][[fire]][[magical]]


**Price** 150 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

The _brazier of harmony_ is a circular, orb-shaped censer etched with celebrating creatures shaking hands and dancing. The brazier contains a pleasant-smelling potpourri of dried flowers and incenses, designed to create a calm atmosphere that encourages meditation, thoughtfulness, and camaraderie. While holding the lit censer, you gain a +1 item bonus to Diplomacy checks, whether the censer is activated or not.

**Activateâ€”Light Incense** `pf2:2` (aura, manipulate)

**Frequency** once per day

**Cost** incense worth at least 1 sp

**Effect** When the incense is lit, pleasant, floral smoke surrounds the censer in a 20-foot emanation, creating a space of peace and harmony. Each creature that breathes the smoke is affected by 3rd-rank [[Spells/Calm|Calm]] and is then temporarily immune for 24 hours. The spell's effects end when the incense burns out.
