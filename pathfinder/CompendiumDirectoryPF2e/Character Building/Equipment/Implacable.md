This substantial rune makes you difficult to hold back. Whenever you are affected by an effect that lasts until you [[Actions/Escape|Escape]] (for instance, from the [[Actions/Grapple|Grapple]] action or a tanglefoot bag), you become [[Conditions/Quickened|Quickened]]. You can use the extra action each round only to Step or Escape.
