# One Hundred Victories
## Item 3
### [[invested]][[magical]][[tattoo]]


**Price** 60 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** tattooed-on-the-body

One hundred cuts, healed into diamond-shaped scars, represent the ability to withstand the attacks of your enemies. Orc warriors covet these scar patterns and cluster them around what they consider to be their strongest assetsâ€”a pattern around the heart signifies a warrior with great endurance, while one along the arms indicates great upper body strength.

You gain a +1 item bonus to Intimidation checks. If you have Ferocity (such as from the [[Feats/Orc Ferocity|Orc Ferocity]] feat or a similar ability), the first time each day you use it, instead of remaining at 1 Hit Point, your Hit Points are set to an amount equal to your ancestry Hit Points, even if this amount is more than you had before using Ferocity.
