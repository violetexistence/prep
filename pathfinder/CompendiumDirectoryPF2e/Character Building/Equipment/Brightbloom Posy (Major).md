# Brightbloom Posy (Major)
## Item 19
### [[magical]][[plant]][[spellheart]]


**Price** 36000 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** affixed-to-armor-or-a-weapon

Appearing as vibrant as the day they were picked, this cluster of flowers is arranged in a small spray, tied with a red satin ribbon. The spell DC of any spell cast by activating this item is 41.

*   **Armor** You gain the ability to speak with flowers, as [[Spells/Speak with Plants|Speak with Plants]].
*   **Weapon** (disease) After you cast a plant spell by activating the posy, pollen coats your weapon. Your next Strike causes the target to be [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] on a hit ([[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]] on a critical hit). If the creature attempts to recover, it sneezes rather than retching (rolling against the spellheart's spell DC). If you don't make a Strike by the end of your next turn, the pollen becomes inert. Plant creatures are immune.
