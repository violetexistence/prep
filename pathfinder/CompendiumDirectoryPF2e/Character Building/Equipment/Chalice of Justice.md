This gleaming golden sword is a _+2 greater striking holy cold iron longsword_ given only to the worthiest heroes of a holy faith. It's made of a sacred, secret alloy that makes the blade both cold iron and silver. If you're unholy, you're [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 2]] while holding a _chalice of justice_. You can't recover from this condition while holding the weapon.

**Activateâ€”Sip of Justice** `pf2:**1**` (manipulate)

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** The pommel of the weapon transmutes into the shape of a miniature chalice. You drink deep from the chalice and regain HP equal to the chalice's level. If you're holy, you regain double the HP, and for 1 minute, whenever you critically hit an unholy creature with the _chalice of justice_, the creature takes 2d6 persistent spirit damage, and it's [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] for 1 round. The persistent spirit damage has the holy trait.
