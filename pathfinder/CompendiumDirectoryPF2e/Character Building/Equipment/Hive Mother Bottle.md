This bottle is packed with dirt, though the shrunken corpse of an ankhrav hive mother is buried within. When you open the bottle, the effigy of a Huge ankhrav hive mother emerges, burrows up to 20 feet, and then erupts from the ground spraying acid, creating a 15-foot-by-15-foot pit that's 10 feet deep. Creatures standing in this area take 6d6 acid damage and 1d6 persistent acid damage (`DC 24 Reflex check` save). A success or critical success means the creature also leaps to safety, landing in the nearest space adjacent to the pit. A failure or critical failure means the creature falls into the pit. Climbing out of the pit requires a successful `DC 22 Athletics check` check.

**Craft Requirements** Supply the corpse of an ankhrav hive mother.
