Freeze ammunition carries chilling reagents that activate on contact with the target. A creature hit by activated freeze ammunition takes cold damage instead of the weapon's normal damage type, plus 2 cold splash damage. Hitting a 5-foot-square surface successfully with freeze ammunition deals 2 cold splash damage and covers the space in a layer of ice. Each creature standing on the icy surface must succeed at a `DC 20 Reflex check` save or `DC 20 Acrobatics check` check or else fall [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]. Creatures using an action to move onto the icy surface must attempt either a Reflex save or an Acrobatics check to [[Actions/Balance|Balance]]. Creatures that Step or [[Actions/Crawl|Crawl]] don't need to attempt a check or save. The ice melts after 1 minute, although unusually hot or cold temperatures can change this duration at the GM's discretion. Dealing at least 1 point of fire damage to the ice removes it instantly
