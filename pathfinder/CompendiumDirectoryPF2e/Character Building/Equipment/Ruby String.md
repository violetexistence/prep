# Ruby String
## Item 14
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[consumable]]

**Category** other; 
**Price** 900 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

The frayed threads from the rips and tears in _Hao Jin's Tapestry_ still contain traces of the Ruby Phoenix's magic. Hao Jin has collected most of these loose strings, but others occasionally find these potent silk strands in unexpected places. A ruby string can fulfill the cost requirement for an 8th-rank _create demiplane_ ritual. When used in this way, the ruby string negates the need for secondary casters, and you get a success for all secondary checks. Alternatively, you can activate it to create a smaller demiplane without requiring the ritual.

**Activate** 8 hours (envision, Interact)

* * *

**Effect** You spin the thread to form a demiplane with the effects of a successful 8th-rank _create demiplane_, but the space is a single 10-foot cube.
