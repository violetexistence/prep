# Reinforced Surcoat

### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[adjustment]]


**Price** 2 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** applied-to-medium-heavy-armor

This surcoat is made of thick fabric and light chain, designed to protect vital areas. When you are critically hit by an attack, you gain physical resistance equal to 2 + the value of the armor's potency rune against the attack's damage. If the armor is in the chain armor group and you have its armor specialization effect, you instead increase the physical resistance from the chain armor specialization by 2. This can't reduce the damage to less than the damage rolled for the hit before doubling for a critical hit. However, the reinforced surcoat increases the Speed penalty of your armor by 5 feet.
