# Frost Worm Snare
## Item 9
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[clockwork]][[cold]][[consumable]][[mechanical]][[snare]][[trap]]

**Category** snare; 
**Price** 115 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

The snare takes the form of a Tiny frost worm clockwork toy. When a creature enters its square, the snare activates, causing the worm to let loose a 30-foot line of frost in the direction from which the creature entered the square. For instance, if a creature entered the square coming from the south, the worm would shoot the line south, to hit any allies of the triggering creature. Those within the line take 10d6 cold damage with a `DC 25 Reflex check` save. After spitting its frost, the snare falls apart.
