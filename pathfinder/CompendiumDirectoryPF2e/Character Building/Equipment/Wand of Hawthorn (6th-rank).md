# Wand of Hawthorn (6th-rank)
## Item 14
### [[magical]][[plant]][[wand]]


**Price** 4500 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

Carved from a hawthorn branch, this wand has a smooth handle, but the shaft remains covered in bark and long thorns. Polished red stones, arranged like a cluster of berries, decorate the pommel.

* * *

**Activate** Cast a Spell

**Frequency** once per day, plus overcharge

**Effect** You cast 6th-rank [[Spells/Oaken Resilience|Oaken Resilience]], and the target sprouts long thorns like those of a hawthorn tree. While [[Spells/Oaken Resilience|Oaken Resilience]] lasts, any creature that hits the target with an unarmed Strike or otherwise touches it takes 3d4 piercing damage from the thorns. A creature that has engulfed or swallowed the target takes this damage as well at the start of each of the target's turns.

* * *

**Craft Requirements** Supply a casting of _oaken resilience_ of the appropriate rank.
