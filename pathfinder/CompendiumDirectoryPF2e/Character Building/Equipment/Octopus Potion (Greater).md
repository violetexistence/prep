# Octopus Potion (Greater)
## Item 13
### [[consumable]][[magical]][[morph]][[potion]][[water]]

**Category** other; 
**Price** 500 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

**Activate** `pf2:1` (manipulate)

Eight flailing octopus arms covered in suckers pop out from the sides of your body when you imbibe this potion. The arms share your multiple attack penalty and attempt to [[Actions/Grapple|Grapple]] a random enemy within 15 feet of you. On a success, roll 1d4 to determine an additional effect of the arms, which lasts as long as the target remains [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]] by the arms. On subsequent turns, you can use a single action, which has the attack trait, to have the arms either Grapple a creature currently grappled or restrained (with no added effect) or release any creature they currently hold and repeat their initial effect. After 1 minute, the arms disappear and the potion's effects end.

The Athletics modifier is +22 and the Escape DC is 30.

  

| bludgeoning damage equal to the potion's level immediately and at the end of each of its turns. |
