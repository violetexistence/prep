# Humbug Pocket (Greater)
## Item 17
### [[invested]][[occult]]


**Price** 12500 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** worn

Fine silk lines this fashionable pocket, which is typically cinched to a belt or tailored into a piece of formal clothing. The pocket can hold no more than one item of light Bulk, plus incidental items of negligible Bulk. The pocket grants you a +3 item bonus to Society and to Stealth checks to [[Actions/Conceal an Object|Conceal an Object]] in the pocket.

The pocket can produce stationery and writing implements of high quality. When you [[Actions/Create Forgery|Create a Forgery]], you can use the pocket to produce ideal materials to make the forgery. Any materials must be able to fit through the opening of the pocket, such as a roll of parchment, an inkwell, or a loupe. Though they're excellent tools, they don't have any value if sold and disappear once their function in making a forgery is fulfilled.

**Activate—Papers Please** `pf2:1` (concentrate, manipulate)

**Frequency** once per hour

**Effect** You create up to 5 temporary forgeries by imagining the documents you need and pulling them from the pocket. Attempt to Create a Forgery of the documents you desire, with the GM rolling the secret check as normal. Their quality is based on your check, but the documents disintegrate after 1 hour.

All 5 forgeries must serve a similar purpose—five invitations to the same party for different attendees, for example. Attempt only one check for all the documents.
