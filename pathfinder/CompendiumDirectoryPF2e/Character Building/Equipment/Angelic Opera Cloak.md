This luxurious cloak embodies an angel's swiftness. You gain a +3 item bonus to Acrobatics checks and never take falling damage, as your cloak billows like a pair of wings to soften any fall you take. When you invest in the cloak, you either increase your Dexterity score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever would give you a higher score. If you are unholy, you are [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] while wearing this cloak.

**Activateâ€”On Angel's Wings** `pf2:2` (concentrate)

**Frequency** once per hour

**Effect** The opera cloak transforms into two pairs of brilliant, feathered wings that grant you a fly Speed of 40 feet for 10 minutes. During this time, you gain immunity to paralysis effects and ignore effects that would give you a circumstance penalty to speed.
