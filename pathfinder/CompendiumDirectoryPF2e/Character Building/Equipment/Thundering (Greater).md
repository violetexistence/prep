# Thundering (Greater)
## Item 15
### [[magical]][[sonic]]


**Price** 6500 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** etched-onto-a-weapon

A _thundering_ weapon lets out a peal of thunder when it hits, dealing an extra 1d6 sonic damage on a successful Strike. On a critical hit, the target must succeed at a `DC 34 Fortitude check` save or be [[Conditions/Deafened|Deafened]] permanently.

Sonic damage dealt by this weapon ignores the target's sonic resistance.
