# Archaic Wayfinder
## Item 2
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[invested]][[magical]]


**Price** 30 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

**Activate** Cast a Spell

An _archaic wayfinder_ functions as a compass and acts as a repository for one cantrip cast into it. To fill an _archaic wayfinder_, a spellcaster casts the chosen cantrip into the empty device, providing any necessary cost; the spell cannot be one that is normally cast as a free action or reaction.

Activating an _archaic wayfinder_ is the same as the casting for the relevant spell. Once it has been activated, it becomes empty again. An _archaic wayfinder_ can hold an aeon stone and activate its resonant power. An archaic wayfinder counts against the limit of one wayfinder with a slotted resonant aeon stone.
