**Price** 225 gp;

A _demolishing_ weapon is made to destroy constructs. Damage inflicted on a construct with a demolishing weapon continues to spread throughout the creature-cracks form, linkages fail, surfaces erode-and otherwise dismantle its body. When you damage a construct using a _demolishing_ weapon, you deal an extra 1d6 persistent force damage. On a critical hit, you deal an extra 1d12 persistent force damage instead
