**Price** 160 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** worn

This rose-gold ring is adorned in the center by a somewhat ominous-looking horned skull. This ring gives you the power to cast the following innate arcane cantrips any number of times each day: [[Spells/Detect Magic|Detect Magic]], [[Spells/Telekinetic Hand|Telekinetic Hand]], and [[Spells/Prestidigitation|Prestidigitation]]. Each is cast as a 1st-rank spell. If you are an arcane spellcaster, these can instead be heightened to the rank of your cantrips.
