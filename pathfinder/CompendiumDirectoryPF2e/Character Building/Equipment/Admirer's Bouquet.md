## Item 7
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[magical]]


**Price** 350 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

An admirer's bouquet appears to be a colorful silken handkerchief that exudes a pleasant floral scent until it's picked up, at which point a dozen vibrantly colored long- stemmed flowers appear in the carrier's hand, the stems wrapped in the silk.

**Activate** `pf2:1` Interact

**Frequency** once per minute

* * *

**Effect** By taking a deep sniff of the pleasant-smelling flowers, you can speed your recovery from nausea and reduce your [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened]] value by 1.

* * *

**Activate** `pf2:r` Interact

**Frequency** once per hour

**Trigger** an ally with a free hand ends their turn adjacent to you

* * *

**Effect** You hand the admirer's bouquet to the triggering ally. If they accept the bouquet, they gain a +1 item bonus to saves against emotion and mental effects as long as they continue to carry the admirer's bouquet. If they're currently suffering from a debilitating emotion or mental effect as the result of a saving throw made during the previous turn, they can immediately attempt a new saving throw against that effect upon being given the bouquet; if they do so, they gain the admirer's bouquet's +1 item bonus to this saving throw. An admirer's bouquet can allow for a new saving throw in this way only once per day.
