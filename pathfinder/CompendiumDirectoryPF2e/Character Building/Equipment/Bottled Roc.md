This bottle contains a shrunken bird preserved with its feathers intact. When opened, the contents reconstitute into a Gargantuan effigy of a great roc, which can appear in the air instead of on the ground. The roc clutches up to two creatures, who become [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]], then Flies up to 90 feet and Releases the creatures. The targets must be within 15 feet of the roc; if any of them are unwilling to be grabbed, the roc must [[Actions/Grapple|Grapple]] them with a +17 Athletics modifier or fail to pick them up.

**Craft Requirements** Supply the corpse of a roc.
