A stock carved of enchanted wood forms the base for a _musket staff_, a magic weapon used by a gunwitch as both a powerful firearm and magical staff. Many other variants exist with different spells. This _+1 flintlock musket_ has a [[Equipment/Reinforced Stock|Reinforced Stock]] permanently attached to it, and the musket's _weapon potency_ rune (and any other runes) applies to Strikes with the stock as well. The _musket staff_ also contains spells and can be prepared following the same rules as a staff.
