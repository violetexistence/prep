**Requirements** You don't have the umbrella activation of this cloak active

**Effect** With a wave of the cloak to the left, you cause the image of the lantern-holding companion on the cloak to vanish. A floating red lantern appears at your side and follows you at an arm's length while casting bright light in a 20-foot radius (and dim light for the next 20 feet) like a torch. For 1 hour, while the light from this lantern is active, you gain a +1 item bonus to Diplomacy checks. You can Activate the cloak again to dismiss the torch.
