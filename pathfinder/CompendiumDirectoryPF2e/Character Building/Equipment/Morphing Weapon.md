# Morphing Weapon
## Item 7
### [[magical]][[metal]]


**Price** 360 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-or-two-hands

In its base form, this armament looks like a smooth bar of soft, gleaming metal shaped like a horseshoe. Its ability to adjust to any battle situation makes it a popular weapon for elite warriors of the Plane of Metal. It can be shaped into a melee weapon using its shifting rune, but it can shift only into weapons primarily made of metal or back to its base shape. In weapon form, it's a _+1 striking shifting_ weapon.

**Activate**â€”Reshape `pf2:1` (concentrate)

**Frequency** once per 10 minutes

**Effect** Strike with the morphing weapon, choosing one of the following benefits to apply to the Strike.

**Take** If the Strike hits, you can attempt to [[Actions/Disarm|Disarm]] or [[Actions/Steal|Steal]] from your target immediately after as a reaction.

**Weigh** Gain a status bonus to the damage roll equal to the weapon's number of damage dice.
