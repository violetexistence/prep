This flask contains a caustic irritant that makes a target's skin, scales, or carapace extremely sensitive to further nicks and burns. An inflammation flask deals the 3d6 acid damage and 3 acid splash damage. On a hit, the target also gains weakness 3 to acid, fire, and slashing damage for 3 rounds. You gain a +2 item bonus to attack rolls.

The target can end the weakness effect by three means: being drenched with water (such as submersion or exposure to an area water effect), being Administered First Aid (DC 30), or regaining Hit Points from a single effect equal to twice the inflammation flask's level. A creature that critically fails to Administer First Aid in this way deals untyped damage to the target equal to the inflammation flask's initial acid damage.
