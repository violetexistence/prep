This _+1 striking ghost touch katana_ is made from a whisker stolen from the king of cats over three hundred years ago by a catfolk rogue named Vashu Vigaru. He sought the magic of the whisker to preternaturally extend his life, and some believe he still lives, having successfully divested himself of the sword to escape the king's wrath in the end.
