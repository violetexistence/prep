A _zealot staff_'s color, iconography, and materials vary depending on the faith it's dedicated to. An Iomedaean staff might be forged of gold and shaped like an ornamental sword, while a Lamashtan one could instead be made of blackened iron depicting monstrous faces. Used as a weapon, the staff is a _+3 greater striking staff_. The staff represents vehement support of the deity to whom the staff is dedicated, punishing defiance. When you prepare this staff, if you don't worship its deity, you become [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]] until your next daily preparations.

**Activate** `pf2:0` (concentrate, sanctified, spirit)

**Frequency** once per 10 minutes

**Trigger** You hit with a Strike using the staff

* * *

**Effect** A vicious blast of deific power explodes as you hit. You deal an additional 1d4 spirit damage per damage die of the staff to the target of your Strike.

* * *

**Effect** You expend a number of charges from the staff to cast a spell from its list. Add the cleric spells granted by your deity to the list for their rank and each higher rank. For example, a zealot staff of Sarenrae would add _breathe fire_ at 1st through 7th rank, _fireball_ at 3rd through 7th rank, and _wall of fire_ at 4th through 7th rank.
