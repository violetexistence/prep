## Item 11
### [[invested]][[magical]]


**Price** 1250 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med

A _bravery baldric_ is a belt that wraps around the shoulder and draws on your well of courage. When you critically succeed on a save against a fear effect or reduce your frightened condition to 0, the baldric gains 1 charge, which slightly alters the color, turning it light blue. A _bravery baldric_ can hold up to 2 charges, and its charges reset to 0 when you invest it. You can have only one _bravery baldric_ invested at a time.

**Activate** `pf2:2` (concentrate)

**Frequency** once per hour; **Cost** 1 charge from the baldric

**Effect** The baldric is light blue when charged, and it casts [[Spells/Fly|Fly]] on you.
