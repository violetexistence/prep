# Dirt Sea in a Jar
## Item 9
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[magical]]


**Price** 880 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

This small jar of dark sand swirls intensely as you peer into it, evoking the dangerous beauty of the Dirt Sea.

**Activate** `pf2:1` or `pf2:2` (manipulate)

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You pour the contents of the jar onto unworked ground. If you activate this item with one action, you pour the sand into one or two 5-foot squares adjacent to you. If you activate this item with two actions, the sand spreads across a 15-foot cone. The affected space turns into [[Hazards (Rulebooks)/Quicksand|Quicksand]]. Creatures already in the area can Step out of the area as a reaction. The quicksand doesn't inflict lasting damage to most surfaces or nearby architecture, though a feature surrounded by the quicksand might sink or settle naturally. This terrain lasts for 1 day or until the effect is Dismissed, causing the sand to reappear in the jar.
