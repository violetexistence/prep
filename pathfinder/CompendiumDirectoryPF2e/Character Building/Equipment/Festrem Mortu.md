# Festrem Mortu
## Item 6
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[cursed]][[grimoire]][[magical]]


**Price** 230 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

The book's cover is a patchwork of tanned humanoid skin that reeks of rotting meat. The longer a living creature studies this book, the more the scent of decay appeals to them.

**Activate** `pf2:r` (concentrate, necromancy)

**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** Your last action was to cast a necromancy spell prepared from this grimoire

* * *

**Effect** You draw void energy from the triggering spell. You gain 10 temporary hit points that last for 1 hour.

* * *

**Special** If this grimoire is used to prepare spells five days in succession by the same caster, that caster is subjected to the curse of the ravenous.

**Curse of the Ravenous**

This hideous curse kills through constant hunger. You become gaunt and repeatedly gnash your teeth.

**Saving Throw** `DC 20 Fortitude check`

* * *

**Effect** No matter how much you eat, you aren't satiated. After 1 day, you begin starving. Each week, you receive a new saving throw against the curse.
