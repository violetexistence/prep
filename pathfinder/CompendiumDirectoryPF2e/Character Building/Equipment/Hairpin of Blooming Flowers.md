# Hairpin of Blooming Flowers
## Item 7
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[invested]][[magical]]


**Price** 360 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** worn

The flower that adorns this hairpin is a blooming lotus flower that varies in color; it regrows in a day after the item is activated. Whether or not the hairpin's flower is in bloom, as long as you wear it and it's invested, it grants a +1 item bonus to Diplomacy checks.

**Activate** `pf2:2` envision, Interact

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** You pluck the flower from the hairpin and scatter the petals, creating a flurry of color in a 10-foot burst centered on you. You become [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] for 1 minute or until you move from your current location. Any creature within the 10-foot burst when you Activate the Item must succeed at a `DC 23 Reflex check` save or become [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] until the end of its next turn (or [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] until the end of its next turn on a critical failure). The flower blooms again the next day.
