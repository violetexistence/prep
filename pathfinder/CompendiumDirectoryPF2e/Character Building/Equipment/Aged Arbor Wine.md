Watering grape or berry bushes with certain alchemical liquids as they grow results in a ruby-red drink that's rich and heady. The vines develop a connection to their natural environment and impart it onto the wine's imbiber. For 1 minute after drinking a glass of arbor wine, you have tremorsense at a range of 30 feet.

[[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Arbor Wine|Effect: Arbor Wine]]

Arbor wine that has been aged for several years—or artificially aged with alchemy—develops both a greater complexity of flavor and a stronger connection to nature. When you drink aged arbor wine, vegetation in a 20-foot emanation around you begins to writhe, becoming difficult terrain until the start of your next turn.
