# Murderer's Knot
## Item 7
### [[consumable]][[magical]][[talisman]]

**Category** talisman; 
**Price** 66 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** affixed-to-weapon

**Activate** `pf2:0` (concentrate)

**Trigger** You damage an [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] creature with a Strike using the affixed weapon

* * *

This black strand of leather is tied to look like a peace knot when the weapon is worn, but it doesn't hamper drawing the weapon. When you activate the knot, the creature you damaged takes 1d6 bleed damage and is off-guard until the bleed ends.

If you have the [[Feats/Twist the Knife|Twist the Knife]] feat, the talisman instead deals persistent bleed damage equal to your sneak attack damage.
