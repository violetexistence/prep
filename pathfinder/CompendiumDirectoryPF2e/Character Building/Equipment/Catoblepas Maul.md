The putrid stench emanating from the catoblepas antlers adorning this _+2 greater striking [[Equipment/Crushing (Greater)|Greater Crushing]] maul_ interferes with your sense of smell. While wielding this weapon, you gain a +2 item bonus to saves against olfactory effects.

**Activateâ€”Vile Stench** `pf2:1` (manipulate, olfactory)

**Requirements** Your last action was a successful Strike with the _catoblepas maul_
