This slender, rapier-like sword is concealed within a wooden or metal cane that serves as a sheath, making it an inconspicuous weapon easy to slip past inspections or into high-society events. A sword cane is typically 4 feet long when sheathed, and its hilt is usually capped with a wooden or metal decoration.
