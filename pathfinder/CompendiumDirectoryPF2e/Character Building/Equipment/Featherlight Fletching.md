Elven archers were the first to create the _featherlight fletching_, meant for long-range battles, though artisans of many other ancestries have now learned the art of crafting these whetstones. A _featherlight fletching_ is a feather-shaped trinket crafted of spun silver filigree and aids projectiles in flying true, even over great distances. A ranged weapon under the effects of a _featherlight fletching_ doubles its range increment for 1 minute.
