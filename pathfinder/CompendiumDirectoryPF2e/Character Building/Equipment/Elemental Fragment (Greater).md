This chunk of solidified planar energy is as large as a walnut and comes in six different varieties: a clear piece of crystal for the Plane of Air, a rough piece of rock for the Plane of Earth, a solidified piece of cooled lava for the Plane of Fire, a compact piece of iron for the Plane of Metal, a solid piece of ice for the Plane of Water, or a compact mass of plant matter for the Plane of Wood. You crack the fragment as you activate it, unleashing the planar energy within. This energy casts a spell of your choice: a 6th-rank [[Spells/Elemental Form|Elemental Form]] spell affecting you or a 6th-rank [[Spells/Summon Elemental|Summon Elemental]] spell; if you summon an elemental, you can Sustain the activation to keep control of the elemental. The spell's element matches that of the fragment.
