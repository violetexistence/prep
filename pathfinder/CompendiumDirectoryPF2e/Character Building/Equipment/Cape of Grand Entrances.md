This regal blue cape is crafted from a hefty yet elegant velvet embroidered with ornate silver stars and dragons. Falling in a cascade of fabric, the cape rustles and flows in all the right ways and hangs upon your shoulders in a way that flatters your form and figure. You draw the eyes of those around you and gain a +2 item bonus to your Performance checks.

**Effect** With a flourish of your cape, you make a grand entrance that draws the attention of those around you. You cast [[Spells/Enthrall|Enthrall]] with a DC of 25 (`DC 25 Will check`). The spell gains the visual trait and loses the auditory trait. You Sustain the Spell by continuing to sweep the cape about.
