The euphemistically named saboteur's friend looks, smells, and tastes like an appetizing chocolate square. You lace the chocolate with reagents that induce a strong laxative effect. Saboteur's friend is useful for incapacitating rather than dealing lasting harm. Unlike some poisons, saboteur's friend can have its sickened condition reduced (but changing to a higher or lower stage after a save applies any sickened condition listed for that stage, as normal).

**Saving Throw** `DC 20 Fortitude check`

**Onset** 10 minutes

**Maximum Duration** 1 hour

**Stage 1** [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] (10 minutes)

**Stage 2** [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]] and [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]] (10 minutes)

**Stage 3** enfeebled 1, [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]], and [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 3]] (10 minutes)
