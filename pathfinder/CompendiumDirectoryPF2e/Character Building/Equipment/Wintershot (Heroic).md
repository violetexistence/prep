The echo of the snowcaster Jelarial causes _Wintershot_ to become chill to the touch, yet despite feeling as cold as ice, she never causes harm or discomfort to her partner. _Wintershot's_ string issues a soft hissing sound, as of snow softly falling, and snowflakes drift down from the string and swiftly melt each time the bow is fired. _Wintershot's_ voice is eager and excitable, often waxing poetic on a nearby object or creature of beauty or offering compliments to her partner.

_Wintershot_ is a _+3 major striking greater frost holy composite shortbow_. When making a Strike with _Wintershot_, targets don't gain concealment from the effects of mist or precipitation, and circumstance penalties to attacks imparted from strong winds are negated.

* * *

**Activate—Auroral Shine** `pf2:1` (cold, concentrate, light)

**Frequency** once per minute

**Effect** _Wintershot_ can't use this activation. When you activate Auroral Shine, fire an arrow at a target. If you hit, instead of dealing damage with the arrow, the creature struck must attempt a `DC 43 Fortitude check` save.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature is surrounded by shimmering lights akin to the aurora, causing it to become [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] for 2 rounds. If the creature was [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]], it becomes [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] instead. If the creature was already concealed for any other reason, it's no longer concealed.

**Failure** As success, but the creature also takes 6d6 persistent cold damage, and the lights affect the creature for 1 minute.

**Critical Failure** As success, but the creature also takes 6d6 persistent cold damage, and the lights affect the creature for 10 minutes.

* * *

**Activate—Signal Flare** `pf2:1` (light, manipulate)

**Frequency** once per hour

**Effect** _Wintershot_ fires an arrow-shaped construct of ice straight upward. The arrow soars to a height of 500 feet, or until it strikes a solid surface like a ceiling. When it reaches its apex, it explodes in a brilliant burst, creating a 100-foot radius area of bright light and dim light in the next 100 feet. In the night sky, this beacon can be seen clearly for miles. The beacon remains lit for up to 1 minute in a color of _Wintershot's_ choice. Alternatively, _Wintershot_ can fire this Signal Flare like a normal arrow to attempt to Strike a target her partner can see—if it hits, the arrow inflicts normal damage and attempts to counteract one darkness effect of _Wintershot's_ choice that affects the creature struck, with a counteract rank of 9th and a +25 modifier to the roll (+30 modifier if the source of the darkness effect was created by a fiend).

* * *

**Activate—Rimecrust** `pf2:2` (cold, concentrate, incapacitation)

**Effect** _Wintershot_ causes the deep chill of winter to settle upon a single creature she can see or hear within 30 feet. That creature must attempt a `DC 43 Fortitude check` save, after which point they're temporarily immune to Rimecrust for 24 hours.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected

**Success** The creature's discomfort and shivering from the sudden drop in temperature causes it to become [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the start of its next turn. Creatures that are immune to cold are immune to this effect.

**Failure** The creature becomes encrusted with ice. It becomes [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] and off-guard for 1 minute, or until it Escapes from the crusting ice (DC 43).
