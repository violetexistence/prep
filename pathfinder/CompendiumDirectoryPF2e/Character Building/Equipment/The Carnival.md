_The Carnival_ represents false dreams. When you have _The Carnival_ invested, your flat check DCs to obtain reliable information from divination effects (such as [[Spells/Augury|Augury]] or [[Spells/Read Fate|Read Fate]], or the activation of this card) are reduced by 2 (but not to less than 2). Casting a divination effect with a flat check, whether or not the flat check succeeds, gives a series of subtly different visions that don't confuse the meaning but make you [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] for 1 round. If you're at least 17th level, the flat check is instead reduced by 3.

**Activate** `pf2:1` (divination, prediction) envision

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** You peer into the future and witness yourself walking through a colorful but vaguely sinister carnival, meeting a variety of strange people. One of these people looks more genuine than the others and resembles someone you're likely to meet for the first time in the next 24 hours (if anyone). This resemblance might be metaphorical, such a clown signifying someone who is silly or a stilt-walker representing someone who is tall. You also get a sense for whether this person can be trusted, should be distrusted, or neither, based on how they're most likely to interact with you and your allies. The GM decides who this new person might be, then rolls a secret `DC 6 Flat check`. On a failure, the result is always "neither," making it hard to determine whether a "neither" result is accurate.
