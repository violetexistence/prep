The tip of this _+2 greater striking brilliant standard-grade cold iron rapier_ shines with a flickering sheen of green light that mimics the glittering appearance of Castrovel in the night sky. The carrier of _Castrovel's Beacon_ instinctively knows Castrovel's position in the sky even if it hasn't actually yet risen into view, which grants the wielder a +2 item bonus to [[Actions/Sense Direction|Sense Direction]] when using the stars to orient themself. Additionally, the weapon grants a +2 item bonus to all saving throws against effects that cause the [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] or [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] conditions.

When its _brilliant_ rune is activated, the counteract rank is 6 and the counteract modifier is +21.

**Activate—Starlight Burst** `pf2:1` (manipulate)

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You cast [[Spells/Vibrant Pattern|Vibrant Pattern]] from _Castrovel's Beacon_ as a 6th-rank arcane spell with a `DC 31 Will check` save. Creatures with the elf trait are immune to Starlight Burst, and creatures with the demon trait take a –2 item penalty on all Will saves against the effect.
