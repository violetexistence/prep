# Lantern of Empty Light
## Item 6
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[magical]]


**Price** 240 gp; 
**Bulk** 1; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

It's said that the pale blue light of this eldritch lantern shines from another dimension or even is linked, somehow, to the glow of a ghost when it is consumed by the Outer Goddess Nhimbaloth. A lantern of empty light is not intrinsically an evil item, though it remains a favored tool of those who would manipulate the minds of others for sinister reasons. It can be used as a normal bull's-eye lantern, but prolonged use tends to instill in the user a vague sense of being watched by unseen eyes.

**Activate** `pf2:2` Interact (emotion, visual)

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You direct the lantern's light upon a single living creature within 60 feet. That creature must attempt a `DC 20 Will check` save to resist the light's effects.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected and realizes that you attempted to mentally influence them with the light.

**Success** The creature is unaffected but thinks the light was harmless, unless it knows the true nature of the lantern already.

**Failure** The creature becomes [[Conditions/Fascinated|Fascinated]] by the lantern's light, and remains fascinated as long as you Sustain the Activation, up to 10 minutes.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but you can Sustain the Activation for up to 1 hour. When the effect ends, the fascinated creature remembers any events that took place while fascinated only as indistinct, dream-like memories.

**Activate** `pf2:2` Interact

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You direct the lantern's light upon a single incorporeal undead creature within 60 feet to siphon away some of the creature's essence, dealing 4d8 vitality damage to the creature (`DC 20 Will check` save).
