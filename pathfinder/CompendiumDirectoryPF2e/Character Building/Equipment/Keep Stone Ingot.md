The crowning achievement of Highhelm's millennia of metallurgical advancements and engineering is the beautiful alloy called keep stone. Despite its name, no stone is used in the production of keep stone. Through the use of a highly guarded process that smelts together adamantine and lead, Highhelm's greatest crafters were able to develop a material with an appearance that more closely resembles marble than metal. Keep stone is only slightly weaker than adamantine alone, but with the incredible ability to disrupt magic. Any spell or magical effect targeting raw keep stone must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or the effect is lost.

Keep stone's use in the construction of Torag's Shield is not only to stretch Highhelm's adamantine reserves further and protect the walls from magical assault, but also because of its protective effects on divination magic on both Highhelm itself and its immediate vicinity. If the target of a divination spell is in the presence of a large quantity of keep stone, including a structure, the caster must also succeed at a DC 5 flat check or the spell is lost.
