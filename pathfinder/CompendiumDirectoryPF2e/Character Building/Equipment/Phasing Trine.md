A _phasing trine_ is a metallic triangle embedded with a clear crystal designed in the shape of a bow and nocked arrow. Strikes made with a ranged weapon under the effect of a _phasing trine_ against a target who is observed by or [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] to you (but not [[Conditions/Undetected|Undetected]]) pass through any non-magical barriers or walls in their way, though magical barriers stop the ammunition. These Strikes ignore all cover and circumstance bonuses to AC from shields.

The Strike's damage can't be reduced with a [[Feats/Shield Block|Shield Block]] reaction using a non-magical shield.
