## Item 5
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[invested]][[primal]]


**Price** 160 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** worn

Originally developed as a body modification by oreads, _fleshgems_ are crystals that can be implanted in the skin of a creature of any ancestry. While a _fleshgem_ can be applied anywhere on the body for cosmetic purposes, the most common usage among adventurers is to implant them at the base of the fingers, to be used like brass knuckles.

These pointed crystal shards embedded in your fingers grant you a fist Strike that deals 1d6 piercing damage, is in the brawling group, and has the magical and unarmed traits. Combat fleshgems can be enhanced with the effects of _handwraps of mighty blows_, as normal for an unarmed attack.
