A _singing sword_ is a _+1 striking_ longsword imbued with the consciousness of a boisterous bard, and therefore constantly sings at all times. A _singing sword_ can't stop singing and in fact communicates in no way other than by singing. A successful Diplomacy or Intimidation check against its Will DC can convince it to quiet its singing to a whisper for 10 minutes, or 20 minutes on a critical success, though it quickly grows displeased at anyone who attempts this repeatedly. The _singing sword_ can spend its actions to attack on its own, with the effects of a _dancing_ weapon's activation, except that its attack modifier is +12. Additionally, it can perform the following activations; each casts a composition spell and follows all the usual rules for compositions.

**Activate—Courageous Anthem** `pf2:1` (concentrate)

**Frequency** once per minute
