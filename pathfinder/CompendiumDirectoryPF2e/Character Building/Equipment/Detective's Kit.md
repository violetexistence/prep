# Detective's Kit
## Item 3
### 


**Price** 25 gp; 
**Bulk** 1; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-two-hands

This leather satchel contains empty vials, a pair of tweezers, a supply of small linen cloths, a set of brass calipers and a knotted string for measuring distances, several pieces of chalk, a pen, and a blank notebook for keeping notes. Every component of a detective's kit is of exceeding quality, and thus a detective's kit adds a +1 item bonus to checks to investigate a crime scene, a clue, or similar details. Like other tool kits, a detective's kit uses one hand if wearing the kit and two hands otherwise.
