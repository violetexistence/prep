This suit of leaf weave armor is specially modified to metabolize the alchemical accelerants in medicinal compounds. A special receptacle in the armor can hold an [[Equipment/Elixir of Life (Minor)|Elixir of Life]], which takes 3 Interact actions to install.

**Requirements** An elixir of life is installed in the armor

**Effect** Slithering vines grow from the armor, granting an item bonus to Athletics checks to [[Actions/Grapple|Grapple]], to your Fortitude DC to resist Grapple, [[Actions/Disarm|Disarm]], or [[Actions/Shove|Shove]] attempts, and to your Reflex DC to resist [[Actions/Trip|Trip]] attempts. The bonus is equal to the elixir's item bonus, and lasts for 3 rounds. The activation uses up the elixir, and the armor can't be activated again until a new one is installed.
