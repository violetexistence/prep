# Cauthooj Bagpipes
## Item 13
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[magical]]


**Price** 2600 gp; 
**Bulk** 2; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-two-hands

The main portion of this set of bagpipes is fashioned from the dried skin of a cauthooj, with the feathers still attached. The bird's vocal cords are crafted into the instrument's reeds. The pipes grant a +2 item bonus to Performance checks while playing music with them.

* * *

**Activate—Disorienting Fugue** `pf2:2`(auditory, incapacitation, manipulation, mental)

**Frequency** once per hour

**Effect** You play several notes on the pipes, quickly altering their pitch and tone. Each creature within a 20-foot emanation must attempt a `DC 31 Will check` save to resist the song. Creatures that attempt this save become temporarily immune to Disorienting Fugue for 1 minute.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected and its temporary immunity to Disorienting Fugue increases to 1 hour.

**Success** The target is unaffected.

**Failure** The target is [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]] for 1 round.

**Critical Failure** The target is confused for 1 round and immediately attacks itself (in the normal fashion for attacking oneself while confused). This Strike doesn't give the creature a flat check to recover from the confusion.

* * *

**Activate—Throw Song** `pf2:r` (auditory, mental)

**Trigger** A creature within 30 feet attempts a melee Strike against you or an ally

**Effect** You let loose a staccato chirp from the pipes that appears to come from somewhere else. The triggering creature must attempt a `DC 31 Will check` save. On a failure, the creature redirects the Strike to another creature of your choice within reach of the melee Strike. If no other creatures are within range, the affected creature instead takes a –2 penalty to the Strike.

* * *

**Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials must include the skin and vocal cords of a cauthooj.
