# Stormshard
## Item 6
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[magical]]


**Price** 230 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

These shards of coalesced necromantic essence are sometimes found in the wake of an ancestor storm. Howling spirits are faintly visible, trapped inside the jagged, dark-green glass.

You can use the shard to cow the undead or briefly release the tormented souls from inside the glass. While you hold the stormshard, you gain a +1 item bonus to Intimidation checks to influence the undead. In addition, you can [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] undead creatures, even if those creatures are mindless or otherwise immune to emotion, fear, or mental effects.

**Activateâ€”Free the Spirits** `pf2:2` (concentrate, manipulate)

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You briefly release the spirits from the _stormshard_ before drawing them back into the glass. Each creature in a 10-foot emanation takes 4d8 void damage (`DC 20 Fortitude check` save). You treat the result of your saving throw as one degree of success better than its outcome.
