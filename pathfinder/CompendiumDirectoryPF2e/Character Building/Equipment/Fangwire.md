This kobold wire is thin and hard to see, making it perfect for an ambush. The wielder flicks one handle around a vulnerable spot so that it serves as a catch for the wire, then yanks the other handle back, pulling the wire tight and inflicting painful lacerations. The function and name come from a wire-based trap called a "slow fang."
