When wielded in battle, these silver lances blaze with light. A _radiant lance_ is a _+2 greater striking [[Equipment/Holy|Holy]] [[Equipment/Flaming|Flaming]] silver lance_.

When wielded in battle, the _radiant lance_ sheds bright light in a 60-foot radius.

On a hit against an undead creature that is specifically vulnerable to sunlight, the lance bursts with a brilliant flash of light, and that undead must attempt a `DC 35 Fortitude check` save.
