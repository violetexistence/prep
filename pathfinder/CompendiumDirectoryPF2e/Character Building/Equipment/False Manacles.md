# False Manacles

### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")


**Price** 10 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-two-hands

These manacles are nearly indistinguishable from real manacles upon inspection, but contain a hidden release that enables a wearer who knows the location of the release to free themselves with a single Interact action. An observer who examines the manacles and succeeds at a `DC 20 Perception check` check notices their false nature. On a critical success, the observer finds the location of the hidden catch as well.
