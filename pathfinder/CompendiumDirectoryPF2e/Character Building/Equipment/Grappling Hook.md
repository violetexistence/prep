# Grappling Hook

### 


**Price** 1 sp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

You can throw a grappling hook with a rope tied to it to make a climb easier. To anchor a grappling hook, make a ranged attack roll using your simple weapon proficiency against a DC depending on the target, typically at least DC 20. This attack has the secret trait. On a success, your hook has a firm hold, but on a critical failure, the hook seems like it will hold but actually falls when you're partway up
