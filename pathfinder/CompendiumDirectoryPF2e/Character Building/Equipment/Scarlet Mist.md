Derived from a mixture of krooth venom and an agitating agent, scarlet mist causes bleeding that turns into a foaming mist. When a creature under the effects of scarlet mist takes persistent bleed damage from the toxin, creatures within 5 feet take the splash damage. The persistent damage can't be staunched until the poison's effects end. A creature that can't bleed doesn't take the bleed damage or cause the splash damage but can still take the poison damage.

**Saving Throw** `DC 25 Fortitude check`

**Maximum Duration** 6 rounds

**Stage 1** 3d6 poison damage, 1d4 persistent bleed damage, and 1 poison splash damage (1 round)

**Stage 2** 3d6 poison damage, 2d4 persistent bleed damage, and 2 poison splash damage (1 round)

**Stage 3** 3d6 poison damage, 3d4 persistent bleed damage, and 3 poison splash damage (1 round)
