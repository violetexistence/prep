# Shield Sconce

### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")


**Price** 1 sp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** affixed-to-a-shield

This carefully balanced metal bracket can be attached to the front or top of a shield or tower shield (but not a buckler), allowing you to carry a torch without giving up your shield or holding it in your other hand. While carrying a torch in this way, you must attempt a `DC 11 Flat check` every time you use the Shield Block reaction; on a failure, the torch is extinguished.
