This _+2 greater striking shifting shortsword_ is formed of rapidly vibrating air and magical energy, though it uses the same statistics as iron. The wooden hilt is adorned with four gems, representing the energies of acid, cold, fire, and electricity, that sparkle in sequence at random intervals.

**Activate** `pf2:0` Interact

**Frequency** once per round

3.  _[[Equipment/Frost|Frost]]_, or

2.  [[Spells/Fireball|Fireball]] for _flaming_,
3.  [[Spells/Cone of Cold|Cone of Cold]] for _frost_, or
