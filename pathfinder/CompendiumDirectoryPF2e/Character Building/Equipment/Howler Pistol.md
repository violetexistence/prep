Designed by a gunsmith as a personal challenge, a _howler pistol_ strikes a miniature version of the _sonic horn_ siege weapon's resonating orb with its hammer to generate beams of sonic energy. A _howler pistol_ is a _+1 striking dragon mouth pistol_ that deals sonic damage instead of piercing damage and doesn't have the concussive trait.

**Activateâ€”Resonant Shatter** `pf2:2` (manipulate)

**Frequency** once per day

**Requirements** The _howler pistol_ is loaded

**Effect** You over-torque the _howler pistol_'s hammer to strike the resonating orb harder than normal. The gun fires a concentrated burst of sonic energy that shatters a nearby stone or rock surface, creating a 10-foot burst at a point of impact within the gun's first range increment. Creatures in the area take 5d6 piercing damage (`DC 27 Reflex check` save).

* * *

**Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials must include the powdered horn from a soniphak, processed into a resonating orb.
