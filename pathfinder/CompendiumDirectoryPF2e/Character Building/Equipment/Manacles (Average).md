# Manacles (Average)
## Item 3
### 


**Price** 20 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-two-hands

You can manacle someone who is willing or otherwise at your mercy as an exploration activity taking 10-30 seconds depending on the creature's size and how many manacles you apply. A two-legged creature with its legs bound takes a -15-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds, and a two-handed creature with its wrists bound has to succeed at a `DC 5 Flat check` any time it uses a manipulate action or else that action fails. This DC may be higher depending on how tightly the manacles constrain the hands. A creature bound to a stationary object is immobilized. For creatures with more or fewer limbs, the GM determines what effect manacles have, if any. Freeing a creature from average manacles requires four successful `DC 27 Thievery check` checks.
