# Armor Latches
## Item 1
### [[adjustment]]


**Price** 4 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** applied-to-armor

This armor is easily doffed. A set of armor with armor latches gains the noisy trait; you can't add latches to armor that already possesses the noisy trait. You can remove a set of armor with armor latches with a 3-action activity, which has the manipulate trait. This doesn't affect the time it takes to don the armor.
