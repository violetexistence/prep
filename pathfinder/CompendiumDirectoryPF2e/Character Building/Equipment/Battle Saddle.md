The battle saddle is a special saddle for a mount that has two large, winglike blades. These blades normally lie flat alongside the saddle, providing additional protection for the rider, but they can be deployed with a tug on the reins to slash at enemies adjacent to the mount. When using a battle saddle to parry, you can decide whether the circumstance bonus to AC applies to you or to your mount.
