# Harmonic Hauberk
## Item 13
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[auditory]][[flexible]][[focused]][[illusion]][[invested]][[magical]][[noisy]]

**Category** light; **Group** chain
**Price** 2500 gp; 
**Bulk** 1; **Size** med
**Usage** wornarmor

Rose gold and copper rings in this _+2 resilient chain shirt_ form a vague bird shape. The jingling links tinkle musically, almost like birdsong. While you wear the armor, effects with the auditory trait must first counteract the _harmonic hauberk_ or they have no effect on you.

The _harmonic hauberk_ attempts to counteract [[Spells/Silence|Silence]] spells cast on you and 4th-rank or higher heightened _silence_ spells the first time the armor enters their area (counteract rank 4, counteract modifier +20). After failing to counteract a _silence_ spell, the armor can't attempt to counteract the same spell again, even if you leave and enter the spell's area multiple times.

* * *

**Activate** `pf2:1` command

**Frequency** once per day

**Requirements** You have a pool of Focus Points and at least one composition spell

* * *

**Effect** You gain 1 Focus Point and immediately use the Focus Point to cast [[Spells/Lingering Composition|Lingering Composition]], using your Performance check to determine the effects of the spell, followed by the [[Spells/Rallying Anthem|Rallying Anthem]]. You can use this activation to cast those spells even if you don't have the [[Feats/Lingering Composition|Lingering Composition]] or [[Feats/Rallying Anthem|Rallying Anthem]] feats.
