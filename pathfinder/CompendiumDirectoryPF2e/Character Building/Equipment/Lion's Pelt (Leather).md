Laurisa Tromaine ordered these as prototype uniforms. The fur-lined pauldrons bear the insignia of a lion with a blade in its mouth. The type of blade indicates which bard school one graduated from. When you disguise the armor via its [[Equipment/Raiment|Raiment]] rune, you can choose whether to conceal this symbol or not. You can also use the rune's activation to quickly display or hide the insignia.
