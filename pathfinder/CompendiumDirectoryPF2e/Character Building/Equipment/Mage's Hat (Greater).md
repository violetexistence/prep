# Mage's Hat (Greater)
## Item 9
### [[arcane]][[invested]]


**Price** 650 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** wornheadwear

This hat comes in many forms, such as a colorful turban or a pointy hat with a brim, and is adorned with symbols or runes. It grants you a +2 item bonus to Arcana checks and allows you to cast the [[Spells/Prestidigitation|Prestidigitation]] cantrip as an arcane innate cantrip.

This larger, fancier hat can be activated. Each _greater mage's hat_ has a specific 4th-rank summon spell from the arcane list woven into its fabric, typically [[Spells/Summon Animal|Summon Animal]] or [[Spells/Summon Elemental|Summon Elemental]]. If you prepare arcane spells, you can change the spell to a different 4th-rank arcane summon spell you know when you invest it.
