# Nightmare
## Item 9
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[magical]]


**Price** 250 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** etched-onto-a-weapon

A _nightmare_ rune creates minor phantasmal alterations to a weapon's appearance so that those who look upon it see subtle reminders of their deepest fears. An arachnophobe might interpret the cross guard of a nightmare longsword to look like curving, twitching spider legs, for example, while someone who's afraid of sickness might see a nightmare club as a diseased length of bone crawling with flies. These images are all in the mind of the observer, but they also infuse the weapon with additional power. When you hit with a nightmare weapon, add 1d6 mental damage to the damage dealt. In addition, on a critical hit, the target becomes [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] by overwhelming visions in their mind of personal horrors that linger. If you critically hit a creature that's already stupefied, it becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] as well. These critical hit effects have the emotion, fear, and mental traits.

**Activate** 10 minutes (envision, Interact)

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** The _nightmare weapon_ casts [[Spells/Nightmare|Nightmare]] to your specifications.
