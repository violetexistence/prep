# Thieves' Toolkit (Infiltrator)
## Item 3
### 


**Price** 50 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** other

You need a thieves' toolkit to [[Actions/Pick a Lock|Pick Locks]] or [[Actions/Disable a Device|Disable Devices]] (of some types) using the Thievery skill. An infiltrator thieves' toolkit add a +1 item bonus to checks to Pick Locks and Disable Devices.

If your thieves' toolkit is broken, you can repair it by replacing the lock picks with [[Equipment/Thieves' Toolkit (Infiltrator Picks)|Replacement Picks]] appropriate to your tools; this doesn't require using the Repair action. If you wear your thieves' toolkit, you can draw and replace it as part of the action that uses it.
