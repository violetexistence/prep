**Activate** `pf2:2` envision

**Effect** The aeon stone captures the image of a creature of your size that you can see within 30 feet. It can have up to 3 images captured at a time; if you capture a fourth, you decide which image it replaces.

**Activate** `pf2:2` envision

**Frequency** three times per day

**Requirements** The prism is storing at least one image of a creature of your size

**Effect** The aeon stone casts a 3rd-rank [[Spells/Illusory Disguise|Illusory Disguise]] on you, which must be of one of the creatures it has currently captured. While you are under the effects of this spell, the aeon stone is [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]].

The resonant power allows the stone to capture up to 5 images. If removed from the _wayfinder_, you must decide which images to lose.
