_Swirling sand_ carries a faint trace of strange compulsions from the helical sand spire near Beachcomber. Adding this catalyst to a suggestion spell implants a strange compulsion in one target of the spell. The target creature must spin counterclockwise at the end of its turn if it didn't take a move action that turn. This spin is a free action that has the move trait. This effect lasts for 3 rounds on a success, failure, or critical failure against [[Spells/Suggestion|Suggestion]] (even if the target completes its _suggestion_ in fewer rounds); a target that critically succeeds against _suggestion_ is unaffected by the _swirling sand_.
