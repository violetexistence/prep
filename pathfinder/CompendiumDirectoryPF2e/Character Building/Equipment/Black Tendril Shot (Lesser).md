A glistening, tar-like substance that's displeasing to the touch coats a black tendril shot. When the activated ammunition hits a target, it exudes tendrils that encase the target, which must attempt a `DC 25 Fortitude check` saving throw. The ammunition's effects last until the target Escapes.

**Success** The target is [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] but gains a +2 circumstance bonus to [[Actions/Escape|Escape]] the ammunition's effect.

**Failure** The target is slowed 1.

**Critical Failure** The target is [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 2]].
