# Void Shackles
## Item 17
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[magical]][[void]]


**Price** 12500 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-two-hands

_Void shackles_ are built from supernatural crystals that form in the Void—materials that dig painfully into the flesh of those they restrain. A set of _void shackles_ functions as superior manacles, but while they are in the Void, the crystals fluctuate in response to the plane's energy, which increases all DCs to remove them or [[Actions/Escape|Escape]] by 1 to DC 43. If a check to remove _void shackles_ from a creature fails, the wearer of the manacles takes 10d6 void damage (`DC 37 Fortitude check` save). While a creature is manacled, the _void shackles_ attempt to counteract any teleportation effect that targets the manacled creature, with a counteract rank of 9th and a +25 modifier to the roll. If the teleportation effect is countered, the manacled creature takes 10d6 void damage (`DC 37 Fortitude check` save).

Void shackles can be placed on incorporeal creatures as if they were not incorporeal. An incorporeal creature manacled by _void shackles_ cannot pass through solid objects. Even a soul can be [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]] via _void shackles_, provided the soul was of a 17th- or lower-level creature in life. A soul held in _void shackles_ cannot move on to the afterlife, cannot become undead, and can be transported by simply transporting the shackles.
