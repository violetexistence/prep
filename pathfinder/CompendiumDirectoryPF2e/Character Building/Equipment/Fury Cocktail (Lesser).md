A fury cocktail is a fortifying ginger beer spiked with rum and a mixer. It's rumored to have originated from a barbarian-themed festival in a popular mead hall specializing in alchemical beverages.

**Benefit** You gain a +2 item bonus to melee attack rolls and an additional effect depending on the additive chosen when the brew is created. The effects lasts 10 minutes.

*   **Animalistic** Lemon juice and powdered claws or talons are added to the cocktail. You gain an unarmed attack in the brawling group of your choice between a jaws attack that deals 1d6 piercing damage or a claw attack that has the agile trait and deals 1d4 slashing damage.
*   **Double** This cocktail is just stronger, with more ginger and more rum. You gain resistance 1 to physical damage.
*   **Mournful** A few flower petals add a powerful aroma to the drink. You gain resistance 1 to void damage, or resistance 1 to vitality damage if you have the void healing ability.
*   **Skeptical** A splash of bitters gives the drink a more complex flavor. You gain a +1 item bonus to saves against magic.
*   **Titanic** Yuzu juice and powdered giant hair are added to this cocktail. If you're Medium or smaller, you gain the following effects: you become Large, are [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]], and increase your reach by 5 feet (or by 10 feet if you started out Tiny).
*   **Wyrmhide** Pomegranate juice and elemental reagents are added to the cocktail. You gain resistance 1 to acid, cold, electricity, fire, and poison damage.

**Drawback** You take a –1 penalty to AC and a –2 penalty to Reflex saves.
