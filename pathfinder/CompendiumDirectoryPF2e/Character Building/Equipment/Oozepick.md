You can pour this silver ooze into a lock or similar mechanism to create a set of malleable lockpicks and tools that conform to internal mechanisms. The ooze is treated as a set of thieves' tools that last for 1 hour and provide a +2 item bonus to Thievery checks to [[Actions/Pick a Lock|Pick a Lock]] or [[Actions/Disable a Device|Disable a Device]] against the mechanism into which they were first poured.
