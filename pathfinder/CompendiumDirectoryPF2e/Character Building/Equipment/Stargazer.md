When you invest this clear quartz crystal ball, it orbits your head like an aeon stone. As long as you have the stargazer invested, you can use an Interact action to direct it to orbit one of your hands where you can telekinetically smash the orb into foes, wielding it as a _+2 greater striking returning club_. While you're directing the stargazer, your hand is full, and you can send it back to your head with another Interact action. On a critical hit, the _stargazer_ pulses with hypnotic starlight, [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzling]] the struck creature for 1 round. A _stargazer_ doesn't add critical specialization effects.
