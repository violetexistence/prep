This macabre staff is crafted from gleaming white bone, a spinal column spiraling out of its base with a skull swinging from the spine's tip. It was handcrafted for Nyctessa by her father, a powerful Blood Lord, from her mortal mother's bones.

When you damage a creature with Nyctessa's staff, that creature gains weakness 2 to void damage until the end of your next turn.
