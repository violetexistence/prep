A specialized _+1 striking thundering probing cane_ made from strengthened spruce wood, a _batsbreath cane_ is distinctive for its brass tip. The tip covers a small hollow in the wood that houses quartz crystals infused with latent storm magic.

**Activate** `pf2:1` (manipulate)

**Frequency** once per hour

**Effect** You strike the cane firmly against the ground, causing a pin within the brass tip to tap the crystals and emit a sonic pulse. The pulse reverberates in a 60-foot radius for the next minute, with the cane acting as an antenna to receive the echoes. For 1 minute, as long as you remain in the area and are holding the cane, you gain hearing as a precise sense.
