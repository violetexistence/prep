Cayden's brew is like rich beer or ale, with a golden-brown color and foamy head. For 1 hour after you drink it, you have a +1 item bonus to saving throws against fear effects. Also, you can use a single action to breathe out a 15-foot cone of intoxicating vapor with a burp that can be heard for 100 feet. Any creature in the vapor must attempt a `DC 31 Fortitude check` saving throw. After you use this breath weapon, you can't do so again for 1d4 rounds.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature is [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] and [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] for 1 round.
