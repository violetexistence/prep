# Boots of the Dead
## Item 2
### [[invested]][[magical]]


**Price** 35 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** wornshoes

Perhaps you had no other choice than to steal the boots off a fallen soldier. Yours may have been worn out, full of holes, or even coming apart. Did you take them from a fallen ally or adversary? Everyone looks the same after war has its way. Nevertheless, the guilt you feel weighs you down. You gain a +1 item bonus to saving throws and DCs against forced movement.

**Activateâ€”One of You** `pf2:1` (manipulate)

**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

**Effect** You shuffle your boots, which still stink of the dead, causing one undead creature of your choice to think that you too are undead. The target is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] against the next melee attack you attempt against it before the end of your current turn.
