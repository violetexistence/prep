Sharp, flexible brambles poke from this sack made of intricately intertwined plant fibers. The sack's contents creak under the strain of the tightly compressed bundle.

When thrown, a twigjack sack bursts open, spraying brambles in all directions that gouge and slash nearby creatures. A twigjack sack deals the listed piercing damage, persistent bleed damage, and splash damage.

You gain a +1 item bonus to attack rolls. The bomb deals 2d6 piercing damage, 3 persistent bleed damage, and 2 piercing splash damage.
