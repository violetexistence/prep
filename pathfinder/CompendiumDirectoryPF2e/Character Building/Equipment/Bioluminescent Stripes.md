# Bioluminescent Stripes
## Item 1
### [[graft]][[invested]][[light]][[magical]]


**Price** 10 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** implanted

A line of glands embedded in your skin secretes a chemical that glows when it interacts with the air. As a single action, you can activate your bioluminescent stripes to glow with a bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for the next 20 feet. While you are glowing, you can't be [[Conditions/Undetected|Undetected]] and you take a â€“4 item penalty to Stealth checks to [[Actions/Hide|Hide]] and [[Actions/Sneak|Sneak]]. You can Dismiss the glow as a free action.
