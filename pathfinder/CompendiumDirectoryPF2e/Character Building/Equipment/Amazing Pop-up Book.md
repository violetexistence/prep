# Amazing Pop-up Book
## Item 11
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[grimoire]][[illusion]][[magical]]


**Price** 1250 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

Goblin wizards invented the amazing pop-up book to store their spells without written words, though the tradition has been spreading to illusionists from other cultures. These grimoires have colorful covers and open to reveal three-dimensional scenes illustrating various spells. Goblins delight in constructing the books just right so a terrifying creature, like a horse or dog, pops up toward the reader each time a page is turned.

**Activate** `pf2:0` (concentrate, spellshape)

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** If your next action is to cast an illusion spell prepared from this grimoire that creates illusory terrain or creatures, such as [[Spells/Mirage|Mirage]], you draw forth the pop-up scene. If a creature succeeds, but doesn't critically succeed, at a saving throw to disbelieve the illusion, then just as their mind recognizes the illusion, a startling—though obviously false—illusion pops up somewhere unexpected in their field of vision, visible to only them, dealing mental damage equal to the spell's rank.
