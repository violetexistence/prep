# Saurian Spike (Major)
## Item 15
### [[magical]][[spellheart]]


**Price** 6500 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** affixed-to-armor-or-a-weapon

This jagged, bony growth narrows to a sharp, pointed tip. Deep groves from some former battle scar its surface. The bearer of a _saurian spike_ often feels a sudden surge in power and confidence. The spell attack modifier of any spell cast by activating this item is +24.

*   **Armor** You gain precise scent with a range of 60 feet.
*   **Weapon** (auditory, emotion, fear, visual) When you cast a polymorph spell by activating the spike, your battle form is exceptionally fearsome. Each enemy in a 60-foot emanation must succeed at a `DC 34 Will check` saving throw or become [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] ([[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 3]] on a critical failure).
