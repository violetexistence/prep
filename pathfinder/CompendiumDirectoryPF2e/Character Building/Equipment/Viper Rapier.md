Crafted from flawless jade, the guard of this rapier takes the form of a twisting serpent with the blade thrusting from its open mouth. This rapier functions as a +3 greater striking quickstrike rapier. While wielding the rapier, your movement doesn't trigger reactions when you Stride, [[Actions/Balance|Balance]], or [[Actions/Tumble Through|Tumble Through]]. When you invest the rapier, you either increase your Dexterity modifier by 1 or increase it to +4, whichever would give you a higher value.

**Activate** `pf2:r` (concentrate)

**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** You fail, but don't critically fail, an attack using the viper rapier

* * *

**Effect** The tip of the rapier briefly takes the form of a viper's head, and the blade twists and contorts, biting the target you missed. The target is affected as if successfully poisoned with cave worm venom (DC 43).

* * *

**Activate** `pf2:r` (concentrate)

**Trigger** A creature misses or critically misses you with an attack

* * *

**Effect** With a slight, obviously mocking bow or curtsy, you Step.

**Activate** `pf2:2` (manipulate)

**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

**Effect** You twirl your rapier in a serpentine pattern, causing your form to become a blur of motion. You're [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] for 1 minute or until you take a hostile action. While you're concealed, you also gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Reflex saving throws.
