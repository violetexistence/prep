**Price** 75 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** implanted

You replace your eyes with ones similar to an insect's or a crustacean's, which allow you to better pinpoint movement. Once per day when you attempt a flat check to target a creature that's [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] from you, you can roll twice and take the better result.
