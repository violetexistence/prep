A daub of ectoplasm twitches within this glass container, faintly glowing with ghostly light. When opened, it forms the echo of a departed spirit, which looks like a Medium ghost. You can throw the ampoule up to 30 feet when you Activate it. The ghost utters a final lament, forcing each living creature in a 15-foot emanation except you to attempt a `DC 18 Will check` save. On a failure, a creature becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] (or [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 3]] on a critical failure).

* * *

**Craft Requirements** Supply ectoplasmic residue from a destroyed ghost.
