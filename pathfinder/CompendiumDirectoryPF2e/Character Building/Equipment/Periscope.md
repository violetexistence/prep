# Periscope
## Item 2
### 


**Price** 25 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-two-hands

This is a 2-foot-long tube with two angled mirrors, one at each end. When the mirrors are aligned correctly, you can look around obstacles while remaining behind cover. This doesn't provide a sufficient line of effect to target creatures around corners.
