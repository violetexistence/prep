# Wand Of Splintered Sorrows (Rank 2)
## Item 6
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[attack]][[concentrate]][[magical]][[manipulate]][[wand]][[wood]]

**Category** wand; 
**Price** 250 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

This wooden wand is roughly cut, as if it had been crudely chopped from a tree and left forgotten. When held, the wand imparts feelings of deep sorrow.

**Activate** Cast a Spell

**Frequency** once per day, plus overcharge

* * *

**Effect** You cast [[Spells/Splinter Volley|Splinter Volley]] of the indicated rank. Each splinter contains some of the despair felt by cruelly harvested trees, causing any creature damaged by this spell to become [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] for a number of rounds equal to the spell rank. On a critical success on the attack roll, the target also weeps, becoming [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] for the same duration.

* * *

**Craft Requirements** Supply a casting of _splinter volley_ of the appropriate rank.
