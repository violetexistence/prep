On certain rare occasions, when a particularly despoiled tree or a powerful demonic fungal infestation (such as a Jeharlu Spore) is destroyed, the grimy black ash that remains behind functions as a catalyst called black ash. A [[Spells/Wall of Thorns|Wall of Thorns]] empowered with this catalyst gains the fungus trait and appears diseased and toxic, with greasy filaments of dripping fungus growing through its vines. A creature damaged by this wall's thorns takes an additional 2d6 persistent poison.
