# Oathlamp of Accord
## Item 3
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[light]][[magical]][[mental]]


**Price** 50 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

This hooded lantern takes the form of a translucent prism. It functions as a normal [[Equipment/Lantern (Hooded)|Hooded Lantern]], except that it isn't fueled by oil, but by oaths. While you're holding the lantern, you gain a +1 item bonus to Diplomacy checks.

**Activateâ€”Announce Oath** `pf2:r` (light, mental)

**Trigger** You make a promise in good faith

* * *

**Effect** The _oathlamp of accord_ sheds light without consuming fuel until the promise you made is broken or fulfilled. The GM adjudicates whether a spoken promise is broken or fulfilled. This light and the shutters to conceal it work as normal for a hooded lantern. Any creature in the light of the oathlamp becomes aware of the contents of the oath, along with who made it and how long ago.
