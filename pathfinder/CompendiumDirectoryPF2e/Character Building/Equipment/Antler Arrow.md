* * *

Creation of these arrows was inspired by an encounter with a horned archon scout who sought to peacefully restrain their foes. When an activated _antler arrow_ hits a target, bone antlers extend to pin it down. The target must succeed at a `DC 16 Reflex check` save or become stuck to the surface, taking the critical specialization effects of a bow.

If the hit with the _antler arrow_ is a critical hit and you have access to the bow critical specialization effect, the DC of the Athletics check increases to 15.
