**Effect** The chair deploys a complete [[Equipment/Alchemist's Lab (Expanded)|Expanded Alchemist's Lab]]. The chair is immobile while this lab is deployed, but levers and gears in the chair allow you to easily retrieve and access everything you need from both the attached superb repair toolkit and the deployed lab to Craft. This setup is highly efficient and gives you a +2 circumstance bonus to [[Actions/Earn Income|Earn Income]] using Crafting.
