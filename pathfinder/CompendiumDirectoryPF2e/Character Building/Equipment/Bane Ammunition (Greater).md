Monster hunters favor bane ammunition that contains a capsule of reagents tailored to a particular type of creatureâ€”aberration, animal, beast, dragon, fey, giant, ooze, or both fungus and plant. Each type requires a different formula. When activated bane ammunition hits a target that has a trait matching the selected type, it takes 3d6 persistent poison damage in addition to the damage the attack normally deals.
