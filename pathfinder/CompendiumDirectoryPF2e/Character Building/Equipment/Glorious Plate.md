# Glorious Plate
## Item 14
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[bulwark]][[invested]][[light]][[magical]]

**Category** heavy; **Group** plate
**Price** 4500 gp; 
**Bulk** 4; **Size** med
**Usage** wornarmor

This elegant full plate is embossed with heraldic imagery and never tarnishes or loses its shine. _Glorious plate_ is _+2 resilient full plate_.

In battle, _glorious plate_ sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius, which enemies see as a blinding halo that obscures creatures other than the wearer. When an enemy looks at the wearer, it must attempt a `DC 33 Will check` saving throw. The enemy is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.

**Success** The enemy is unaffected.

**Failure** For 1 minute, the wearer's allies within the glorious plate's 10-foot radius of light are [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] to the enemy. Allies are concealed only while they remain within the light; if allies enter the light later, they are concealed as well.

**Critical Failure** As failure, except the wearer's allies are [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] to the enemy instead of concealed.
