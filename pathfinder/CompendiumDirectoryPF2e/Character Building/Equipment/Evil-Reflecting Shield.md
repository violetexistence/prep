# Evil-Reflecting Shield
## Item 11
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[magical]]


**Price** 1250 gp; 
**Bulk** 1; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

A bright, octagonal frame surrounds this circular dawnsilver shield, which itself is polished to a mirrorlike sheen that reflects clear and true. While you have this standard-grade dawnsilver shield (Hardness 5, HP 20, BT 10) raised, you gain its circumstance bonus to saving throws against spells with the unholy or void trait.

**Activate** `pf2:r` command (fortune)

**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** You attempt a saving throw against an effect with the unholy or void traits

* * *

**Effect** Your saving throw result is considered one degree better than the actual result. If this effect turns a success into a critical success, you can reflect some of the effect's power as a wave of magical backlash back to the source of the triggering effect, as long as the source is within 30 feet. When you do so, the target must succeed at a `DC 28 Fortitude check` save or become [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]].
