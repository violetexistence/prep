Concentrated wolfsbane and other anti-shapechanger reagents fill trueshape bombs. These bombs grant a +2 item bonus to attack rolls and deal 3d6 poison damage, 3d4 persistent poison damage, and 3 poison splash damage. If the primary target is under the effects of a morph or polymorph effect, it must succeed at a `DC 30 Fortitude check` saving throw, or else the effects end and the creature returns to its normal form. Targets taking persistent poison damage from this bomb must succeed at another Fortitude saving throw at the same DC to change shape using a morph or polymorph effect. The persistent damage can last up to 1 minute.
