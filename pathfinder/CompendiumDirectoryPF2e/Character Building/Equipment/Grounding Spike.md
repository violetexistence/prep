Metal caps the bottom of this _+1 striking thundering dancer's spear_ and its point gives off the faint smell of ozone. If you hit a target that has been struck by a polarizing mace within the last round, you deal additional electricity damage to the target equal to the number of _grounding spike_'s damage dice. If you critically hit such a target, the creature is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the start of your next turn.

**Special** The _grounding spike_ pairs with the _[[Equipment/Polarizing Mace|Polarizing Mace]]_.
