These whetstones are miniature stone replicas of weapons, such as a sword or an axe, though their function is the same regardless of their shape. When you attempt a Strike as a reaction (such as with a [[Actions/Ready|Readied]] action or the [[Feats/Reactive Strike|Reactive Strike]] reaction) using a weapon under the effect of a _reactive flash_, the target must first succeed at a `DC 19 Reflex check` save or be [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] against the attack.
