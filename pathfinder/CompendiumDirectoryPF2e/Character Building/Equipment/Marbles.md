# Marbles

### 


**Price** 2 sp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

These tiny round balls are made of polished stone and colorful glass, and come in a bag of 200. You can pour marbles in an empty square adjacent to you with an Interact action. The first creature that moves into that square must succeed at a `DC 13 Acrobatics check` check or `DC 13 Reflex check` save (its choice) or fall [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]. Once a creature enters a space with marbles, enough marbles are scattered that other creatures moving into that space don't need to attempt a roll to avoid falling.
