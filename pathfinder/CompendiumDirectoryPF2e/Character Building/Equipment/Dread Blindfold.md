When tied over your eyes, this ragged strip of black linen gives you a +3 item bonus to Intimidation checks and darkvision. You can see through the blindfold, but only using darkvision.

The first time a particular creature sees you in a day, it must succeed at a `DC 37 Will check` save or be [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]]. This is an emotion, fear, and mental effect, and your allies become immune to it after about a week.

**Activateâ€”Visions of Terror** `pf2:0` (concentrate)

**Frequency** once per minute

**Trigger** You damage a creature with a Strike

* * *

**Effect** Your target is gripped by intense fear. This has the effect of a DC 37 _vision of death_ spell. The creature is then temporarily immune for 24 hours.
