**Maximum Duration** 14 hours

**Stage 1** [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] and a –2 status penalty to visual Perception checks (1 hour)

**Stage 2** dazzled and a –4 status penalty to visual Perception checks (1 hour)

**Stage 3** [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] (2d6 hours); stage 3 is an incapacitation effect, and if the victim is still blinded from the poison when the poison has run its course, the blindness lasts for an additional 24 hours afterward
