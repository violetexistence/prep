# Shadowed Scale, the Jungle Secret
## Item 22
### [unique](unique "Unique Rarity Trait")[[artifact]][[invested]][[magical]][[primal]]


**Price** 0 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** wornmask

This gold-inlaid wooden mask depicts the reptilian visage of a mokele-mbembe, a jungle predator seen by the Mwangi as embodiments of nature's strength and majesty. If you're a Magaambyan who already has a mask, you can use _Shadowed Scale, the Jungle Secret_ in lieu of your own mask for the purposes of mask-related abilities, such as [[Feats/Magic Warrior Dedication|Magic Warrior Dedication]]. When you wear the mask, you are always [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] while in a jungle.

**Activate** `pf2:1` envision

**Requirements** Your last action was a melee Strike that killed a living creature or destroyed an undead creature

* * *

**Effect** You cause the body to decompose into a pile of fertile soil. The creature's body is completely destroyed at the start of your next turn, and it can only be returned to life with the use of powerful magic such as [[Spells/Miracle|Miracle]] or [[Spells/Wish|Wish]].

* * *

**Activate** `pf2:1` Interact

**Frequency** once per hour

**Requirements** You are adjacent to the body of a creature you killed that has decomposed into soil

* * *

**Effect** You pull a seed from the mask and throw it into the soil, where it sprouts. You cast [[Spells/Summon Plant or Fungus|Summon Plant or Fungus]]; the spell is heightened to a level equal to one-half of the slain creature's level, rounded up. When the spell's duration ends, the plant creature returns to the soil, where it roots itself and becomes a non-creature piece of flora.

* * *

**Destruction** If the progenitor of all mokele-mbembes stomps on the mask, it is crushed to splinters.
