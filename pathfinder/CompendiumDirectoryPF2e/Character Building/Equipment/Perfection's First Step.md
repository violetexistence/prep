This palm-leaf manuscript contains an incomplete philosophical treatise about perfection, which you must complete and provide written commentaries upon before you can activate it. This activity takes 10 minutes, but can occur at any time before you activate the treatise.

When you activate _perfection's first step_, you cast [[Spells/Unbreaking Wave Advance|Unbreaking Wave Advance]] with a save DC of 19. You are then temporarily immune to benefiting from further copies of _perfection's first step_ until your next daily preparations.
