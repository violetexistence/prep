Pathfinder Society researchers recently created elemental wayfinders with the assistance of the Society's elemental allies. In addition to the effects of a [[Equipment/Wayfinder|Wayfinder]], these wayfinders each grant the ability to cast a particular elemental spell once per day, and can assist Pathfinders in exploring areas associated with their element. Each has the trait associated with its element.
