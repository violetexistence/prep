# Ring Of Recalcitrant Wishes
## Item 20
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[invested]][[magical]]


**Price** 10000 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** worn

This band of interwoven gold and copper, traced with Aklo symbols, is topped with a gleaming, luminescent opal gently bleeding wisps of shadowstuff.

* * *

**Activate** `pf2:3` command

* * *

**Effect** You attempt to make the ring cast an arcane [[Spells/Wish|Wish]] spell. However, if the ring doesn't deem the wish to be sufficiently selfless, the wish isn't cast and the ring can't be activated for 24 hours.

You are [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 3]], whether or not the ring refuses the wish.

* * *

Once the wish is cast, the Ring of Recalcitrant Wishes has no powers, though it is rumored that the wearer's death in an act of profound self-sacrifice restores the wish to the ring.
