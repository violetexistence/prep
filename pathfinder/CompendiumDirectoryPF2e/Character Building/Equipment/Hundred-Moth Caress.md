| **Damage** 2d10 slashing  | **Usage** held-in-two-hands |



The handles of this _+1 striking scythe_ are made from a dull, gray wood of bone-like consistency, and when you slice with it, a fluttering gust of hundreds of moths' wingbeats fills the air. If you're a devotee of Urgathoa, you can use this scythe as a divine focus, and with every Strike, it exudes a pallid cloud of powdery dust.

* * *

**Activate** `pf2:0` command (divine, necromancy, void)

**Frequency** once per round

* * *

**Effect** You deal 1d10 void damage to yourself. If your next action is to Strike with the scythe or to Cast a Spell with the disease or void trait, that Strike or spell deals additional void damage equal to the damage you took (after any reductions or increases from immunity, resistances, weaknesses).
