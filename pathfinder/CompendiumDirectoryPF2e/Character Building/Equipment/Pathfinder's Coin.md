**Activate** `pf2:1` command

**Requirements** The coin is levitating above a [[Equipment/Wayfinder|Wayfinder]]

**Effect** You give the coin a message of 25 words or fewer. The message repeats in your voice the next time the coin is floated above a _wayfinder_. A _Pathfinder's coin_ can hold only one message at a time, and it replays its message only once.
