### [[auditory]][[consumable]][[mechanical]][[snare]][[trap]]

**Category** snare; 
**Price** 3 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med

You create an alarm snare by rigging one or more noisy objects to a trip wire or pressure plate. When you create an alarm snare, you designate a range between 100 to 500 feet at which it can be heard. When a Small or larger creature enters the square, the snare makes a noise loud enough that it can be heard by all creatures in the range you designated.
