**Price** 1800 gp;

Not to be outdone by their cousins in Dongun Hold, the artificers of Highhelm have developed a handheld magical equivalent to their clockwork drilling constructs and vehicles. The device is still in the testing phases, but early versions have been released to fund more development. Appearing as an unassuming yellow box with two handles normally, when the command word is spoken, a spiraling drill made of force emerges from its top. An active _Highhelm drill_ can be used as an improvised weapon, dealing damage on a Strike as though it had been used on a surface for one round with no additional damage from other sources.

**Activate** `pf2:2` Interact

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** The force drill appears and begins turning, dealing 10 force damage per round to any material against which you hold the drill. The drill ignores the first 8 Hardness of any material it damages. The drill remains active for 5 minutes.
