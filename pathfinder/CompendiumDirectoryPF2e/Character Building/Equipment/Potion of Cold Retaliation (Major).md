For 1 minute after drinking a potion of cold retaliation, you glow with a faint aura of cold energy, and a creature that touches you (such as by making an unarmed attack or using a spell with a range of touch against you) or is adjacent to you and hits you with a melee weapon strike takes cold damage.

The aura deals 4d8 cold damage.
