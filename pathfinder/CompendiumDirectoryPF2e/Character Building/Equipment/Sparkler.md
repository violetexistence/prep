A sparkler gives off colorful sparks, burning for 1 minute. It provides bright light in a 10-foot radius (and dim light for the next 10 feet). While the _sparkler_ burns, you can use it as an improvised weapon, dealing 1 fire on a hit. On a critical hit, you cause the target to become [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] for 1 round.

You can touch a _sparkler_ to a flammable object as part of the action you spend Activating it or as a separate Interact action while the sparkler is already activated. If you do so, the sparkler can ignite flammable objects the way a [[Equipment/Matchstick|Matchstick]] does.
