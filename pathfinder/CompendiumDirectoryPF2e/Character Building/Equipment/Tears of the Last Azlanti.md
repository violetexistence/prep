# Tears of the Last Azlanti
## Item 25
### [unique](unique "Unique Rarity Trait")[[arcane]][[artifact]][[invested]]


**Price** 0 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** wornnecklace

This gold necklace sports six bails, each with a different _aeon stone_. The backside of each bail is engraved with a single ancient Azlanti rune: Patience, Remembrance, Resilience, Tenacity, Wisdom, Invention.

While a bail is active, you recall pieces of childhood memories, brief stories and lessons spoken to you by Aroden. The knowledge imparted by each bail carries a specific power but also allows you to access the invested and resonant powers of the _aeon stone_ in the active bail's slot as though the stone orbited your head. Each day at dawn, a new bail becomes active; roll 1d6 to determine which bail is active, determined by the table below. Only one bail can be active at any time.

Once per day, you can attempt to exchange the _aeon stone_ in a given bail for another _aeon stone_ with a successful `DC 35 Arcana check` check.

**Destruction** The memories and lessons that echo through the _Tears of the Last Azlanti_ give clues about steps needed to destroy the artifact. After you have gained the power of each of the six _aeon stones_ at least once, you are granted visions of six locations across Golarion. At each of these locations, you must replace one of the necklace's _aeon stones_ with a _dull gray aeon stone_. Once the final stone is replaced, the powers of the necklace are drawn into its new stones. These stones become pieces of _throneglass_, and the chain and bails disintegrate.
