# Instinct Crown (Dragon)
## Item 10
### [[invested]][[magical]]


**Price** 900 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** wornheadwear

An _instinct crown_ is a magical headpiece imbued with the essence of instincts that barbarians draw upon in combat. Each crown is fashioned to represent the instinct it's tied to, such as a wolf's head for an animal instinct crown or a simple helmet with Jotun runes for a _giant instinct crown_. When worn, the crown allows you to tap further into your instincts, granting you even greater benefits if the crown's essence matches your instinct. You must be able to [[Actions/Rage|Rage]] to use the crown's activations.

The damage type is that of your instinct's dragon breath.
