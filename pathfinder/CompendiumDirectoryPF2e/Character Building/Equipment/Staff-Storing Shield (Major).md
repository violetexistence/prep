# Staff-Storing Shield (Major)
## Item 15
### [[invested]][[magical]]


**Price** 5500 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

This magically _reinforced wooden shield_ normally has a blank face. It can absorb a staff and transform between a shield and staff. When you prepare a staff, you can hold it up to the shield, at which point the items will merge, and the shield's face becomes an image corresponding to the type of magic, such as a skull for a staff of necromancy.

**Activate** `pf2:1` Interact

**Effect** You change the staff-storing shield from its shield form into the stored staff, which has an image of the shield on it, or change it from the stored staff back into a shield.
