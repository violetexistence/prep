# Mummified Bat
## Item 10
### [[consumable]][[magical]][[talisman]]

**Category** talisman; 
**Price** 175 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** affixed-to-weapon

**Activate** `pf2:1` (concentrate)

* * *

This talisman is the magically treated corpse of a tiny bat bound in papyrus. When activated, the affixed weapon detects vibrations around you and guides your perception. For 1 minute, you don't need to succeed at a flat check to target [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] creatures. You're not [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] to creatures that are [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] from you (unless you're off-guard to them for reasons other than the hidden condition), and you need only a successful `DC 5 Flat check` to target a hidden creature. While you're adjacent to an undetected creature of your level or lower, it's instead only hidden from you.

If you have the [[Feats/Blind-Fight|Blind-Fight]] feat, you gain imprecise echolocation with a range of 30 feet for 1 minute. This makes creatures that would be undetected by you because you can't see them hidden instead.
