# Flame Drake Snare
## Item 5
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[clockwork]][[consumable]][[fire]][[mechanical]][[snare]][[trap]]

**Category** snare; 
**Price** 25 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

The snare takes the form of a Tiny, drake-like clockwork toy. When a creature enters its square the snare activates, causing the drake to spit a gout of fire in a 15-foot cone in the direction from which the creature entered. For instance, if a creature entered the square coming from the east, the cone would point east, to hit any allies behind the triggering creature. Those within the cone take 6d6 fire damage with a `DC 19 Reflex check` save. After spitting its fire, the snare falls apart
