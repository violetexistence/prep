A maelstromic destabilizer is a whirling gyroscope of burnished bronze and glass. It strengthens the bonds that hold a creature to this world by weakening those same bonds to every other nearby creature. When activated, the destabilizer emits a constant pleasant chime as it spins. For the next minute, the creature holding the gadget gains resistance 2 to spirit damage, while all creatures not immune to spirit damage in a 10-foot emanation gains weakness 2 to spirit damage.
