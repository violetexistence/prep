## Item 15
### [[magical]][[spirit]]


**Price** 6000 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** etched-onto-a-weapon

_Astral_ weapons command powerful spiritual energy from the Astral Plane. This rune has the same effects as a _[[Equipment/Ghost Touch|Ghost Touch]]_ rune, plus Strikes with it deal an extra 1d6 spirit damage. If used to attack a creature that's possessing another creature, this weapon deals no damage to the possessed creature. On a critical hit against a creature possessing another creature, the possessing creature must succeed at a `DC 36 Will check` save or be expelled and unable to possess a creature for 1d4 rounds.

Spirit damage dealt by this weapon ignores the target's spirit resistance.
