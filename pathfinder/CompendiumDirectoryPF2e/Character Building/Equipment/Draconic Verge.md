# Draconic Verge
## Item 7
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[magical]]


**Price** 370 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

This scepter is made from dragon bone, with minute runes carved along its length, a dragonskin leather grip, and caps of gold on each end. The scepter grants you a +1 item bonus to Intimidation checks to [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]]. Such items are considered particularly gruesome and vile by dragons, and they're invariably hostile to any creature they discover carrying a draconic verge, going so far as to single out that individual for destruction.

**Activateâ€”Dragon's Eminence** `pf2:2` (concentrate, manipulate)

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** You hold the verge aloft, tapping into the majesty of the dragon from whom the verge was made. All enemies in a 60-foot emanation must succeed a `DC 23 Will check` save or become [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] ([[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 3]] on a critical failure).
