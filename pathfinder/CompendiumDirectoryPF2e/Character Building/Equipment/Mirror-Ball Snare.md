# Mirror-Ball Snare
## Item 6
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[consumable]][[mechanical]][[snare]][[trap]][[visual]]

**Category** snare; 
**Price** 40 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

A mixture of metal shavings and flash powder inside this small, mirrored sphere ignites when disturbed, causing the ball to flash and spin. When a creature enters the square, the ball pops into the air, and all creatures within 10 feet who can see the mirror ball must succeed at a `DC 22 Fortitude check` save or become [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] for 1 round. On a critical failure, affected creatures are instead dazzled for 1 minute.
