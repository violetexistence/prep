### [[consumable]][[magical]]

* * *

Leafy stalks protrude from the shaft of this rustic arrow. When an activated _vine arrow_ hits a target, the arrow's shaft splits and grows, wrapping the target in vines.

The target takes a -10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds for 2d4 rounds, or until it [[Actions/Escape|Escapes]] against a DC of 19. On a critical hit, the target is also [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] until it Escapes.
