**Effect** Abraxas transforms the tattoo into a weapon of your vengeance. The vengeful arm crawls into your hand and becomes a [[Equipment/Retribution Axe|Retribution Axe]]. You can use this activation again while holding the axe to revert the vengeful arm to a tattoo. Like other retribution axes, you can etch fundamental runes into the vengeful arm's retribution axe to increase its potency or to add striking.
