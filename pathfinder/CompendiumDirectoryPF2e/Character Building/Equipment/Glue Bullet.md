These cartridges are filled with sticky clear glue. When a glue bullet hits, a syrupy webbing coats the target and sticks to the ground or a nearby surface, hindering their movement. The target takes a -10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds for 2d4 rounds, or until it [[Actions/escape dc=18|escape dc=18]]{Escapes} against a DC of 18. On a critical hit, the target is also [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] until it Escapes.
