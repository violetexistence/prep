# Compass

### 


**Price** 1 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

A compass helps you [[Actions/Sense Direction|Sense Direction]] or navigate, provided you're in a location with uniform magnetic fields. Without a compass, you take a -2 item penalty to these checks (similar to using a shoddy item).
