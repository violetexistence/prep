## Item 5
### [[magical]]


**Price** 125 gp;

**Effect** You toss the ball of twine into a square within 20 feet. The twine then unravels and animates, attempting to [[Actions/Disarm|Disarm]] or [[Actions/Trip|Trip]] (your choice) a creature in the square with a total of +12 to the Athletics check. At the end of your turn, the twine winds itself back into a ball and returns to your hand; if you don't have a free hand, it returns to your space instead.
