# Engulfing Snare
## Item 14
### [[consumable]][[mechanical]][[snare]][[trap]]

**Category** snare; 
**Price** 900 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

You arrange a spiky cage of bones, particularly tough vegetation, or other material to spring up when disturbed. The snare deals 10d8 piercing damage to the first creature to enter this square; that creature must attempt a `DC 34 Reflex check` save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature is knocked aside by the snare's deployment, takes half damage, and is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the end of its next turn.

**Failure** The creature is captured by the cage, taking full damage and falling [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]. It's [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] while it remains within the cage. It can get free by [[Actions/escape dc=34|escape dc=34]]{Escaping} (DC 34) or by destroying the cage (AC 30, Fort +18, Ref +24, Hardness 5, HP 30, object immunities).

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature takes double damage.
