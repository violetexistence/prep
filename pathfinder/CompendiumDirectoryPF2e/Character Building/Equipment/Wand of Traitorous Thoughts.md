# Wand of Traitorous Thoughts
## Item 12
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[magical]][[mental]][[wand]]


**Price** 2000 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

When you hold this sleek, shiny gray wand, you hear a faint chorus of overlapping whispers.

**Activate** Cast a Spell

**Frequency** once per day, plus overcharge

* * *

**Effect** You cast [[Spells/Mind Probe|Mind Probe]]. The first time the target rolls a success at a Deception check to mislead your probe, it gets a result one step worse than it rolled. This means you learn the answer if the target's Deception check would have succeeded, and you learn nothing rather than believing a falsehood if the check would have been a critical success.

* * *

**Craft Requirements** Supply a casting of [[Spells/Mind Probe|Mind Probe]].
