# Blindpepper Bolt
## Item 3
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[consumable]][[magical]]

**Category** ammo; 
**Price** 10 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

**Ammunition** bolt

**Activate** `pf2:1` Interact

* * *

The head of this bolt is a vented container that smells strongly of caustic pepper. When an activated blindpepper bolt hits a target, it deals no damage; instead the creature must attempt a `DC 17 Fortitude check` save. If the Strike was a critical success, the target takes a -2 circumstance penalty to its Fortitude save. At the GM's discretion, a creature with no eyes or olfactory organs might not be affected by this item.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target is [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] until the end of your next turn. It can end the effect early if it spends an action, which has the manipulate trait, to wipe down its eyes.

**Failure** The target is dazzled for 1 minute.

**Critical Failure** The target is [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] until the end of your next turn and dazzled for 1 minute.
