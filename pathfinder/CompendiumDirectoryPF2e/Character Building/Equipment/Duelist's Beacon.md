# Duelist's Beacon
## Item 8
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[light]][[magical]]


**Price** 450 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

A spiked glove is attached to the front of this _buckler_, functioning as _+1 striking shield spikes_. Perforations and slits line the defensive side, shining bright light through them when the item's magic is activated.

* * *

**Activate** `pf2:2` envision

**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

**Effect** You activate the shield's inner light. Attempt a melee Strike with the duelist's beacon. On a hit, the target must succeed at a `DC 22 Fortitude check` save or be [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] for 1 round. On a critical hit, the target uses the result one degree of success worse than it rolled for its Fortitude save.
