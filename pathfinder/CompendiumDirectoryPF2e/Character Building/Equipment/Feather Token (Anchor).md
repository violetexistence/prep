This feather can be activated only on a boat. When activated, this feather transforms into a massive anchor that causes the boat to immediately stop. After 1 day, the anchor vanishes and the boat can move as normal. The anchor is attached to the boat by a magical chain of force, but the chain can be removed by [[Spells/Dispel Magic|Dispel Magic]] or destroyed (Hardness 30, HP 40).
