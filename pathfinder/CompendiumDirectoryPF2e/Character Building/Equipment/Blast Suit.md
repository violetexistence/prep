# Blast Suit
## Item 9
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[bulwark]][[invested]][[magical]]

**Category** heavy; **Group** plate
**Price** 650 gp; 
**Bulk** 2; **Size** med
**Usage** wornarmor

Crafted from heavy steel plating and riveted together with cunning precision, this suit of +1 resilient [[Equipment/Full Plate|Full Plate]] is specifically designed to protect against sudden explosions. This added layer of security comes at the cost of movement, however.

**Activate** `pf2:r` command

**Trigger** You're affected by an area effect that requires a Reflex save, or you would take splash damage from a scatter weapon

* * *

**Effect** The _blast suit_ locks together into a rigid bulwark, protecting you from the blast but preventing you from moving from your position under any circumstances.

You become [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]], gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Reflex save against area effects, and gain resistance 5 to all damage you would normally take from area effects and scatter splash damage (this doesn't damage the _blast suit_). These effects persist for as long as the suit remains in the locked position. You can Interact with the suit to unlock it.
