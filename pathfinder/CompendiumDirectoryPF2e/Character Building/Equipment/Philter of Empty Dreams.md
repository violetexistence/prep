A _philter of empty dreams_ is a dose of glowing blue liquid that prevents dreams. When you drink a _philter of empty dreams_, you have no dreams for the next 8 hours and gain a +1 item bonus to saving throws against dream- or nightmare-themed effects (including saving throws against the effects of midnight milk). If you're suffering from an addiction to midnight milk when you drink a _philter of empty dreams_, the potion attempts to counteract the addiction with a counteract rank of 4 and a +15 modifier for the roll. If an intellect devourer who's controlling a stolen body uses the body to drink a _philter of empty dreams_, the intellect devourer must succeed at a `DC 24 Fortitude check` save or be forced to Exit the Body immediately.
