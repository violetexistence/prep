Beloved by the church of the Seventh Veil, a _seventh prism_ is a crystal that disperses its internal light, casting an aurora of color. If you use a seventh prism to cast [[Spells/Dizzying Colors|Dizzying Colors]], targets are [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] for twice as long as their saving throw indicates. On a critical failure, the target is dazzled for 1 minute after its [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] condition ends. Motes of shifting rainbow hues cloud the eyes, making it difficult to see details.
