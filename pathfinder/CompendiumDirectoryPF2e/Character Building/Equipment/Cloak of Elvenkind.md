This cloak is deep green with a voluminous hood, embroidered with gold trim and symbols significant in elven culture. The cloak allows you to cast the [[Spells/Ghost Sound|Ghost Sound]] cantrip as an arcane innate spell.

When you adjust the cloak's clasp (an Interact action), the cloak transforms to match the environment around you and muffles your sounds, granting you a +1 item bonus to Stealth checks.
