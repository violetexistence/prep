# Mocker's Swazzle
## Item 13
### [unique](unique "Unique Rarity Trait")[[magical]]


**Price** 3000 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

A swazzle is a device made of two strips of metal bound with sinew and around a reed that, when held to the mouth, causes the user's voice to take on a distinctive rasping tone. Swazzles are often used by street puppeteers to give their puppets' voices a unique and memorable timber. A mocker's swazzle, though, has a different use—rather than simply giving voices to troublemaking puppets, it helps a performer fight back against hecklers in a crowd.

* * *

**Activate—Heckle the Heckler** `pf2:r` (auditory, emotion, linguistic, manipulate, mental)

**Frequency** once per hour

**Trigger** A creature within 30 feet of you attempts and fails to [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] you

**Effect** You quickly fire a retort back at the triggering creature, mocking its failed attempt in a way that makes it laugh at its own ineptitude; you cast [[Spells/Laughing Fit|Laughing Fit]] (`DC 30 Will check` save) on the triggering creature.

* * *

**Activate—Mocking Spell** `pf2:1` (auditory, linguistic, spellshape)

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** You direct a quick bit of insulting mockery at a creature who can understand you that's within earshot. If your next action is to cast a mental spell that targets only that creature, that creature takes a –1 item penalty to any saving throw against the spell and, regardless of the result of the saving throw, becomes [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the start of your next turn.
