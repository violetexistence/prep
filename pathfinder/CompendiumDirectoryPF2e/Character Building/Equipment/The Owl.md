_The Owl_ represents the wisdom of nature and the natural order. As long as you have _The Owl_ invested, it grants a +2 item bonus to Perception checks made to [[Actions/Sense Motive|Sense Motive]], Survival checks to [[Actions/Subsist|Subsist]] in the wild, and Nature checks made when you activate this card. This increases to a +3 bonus if you are at least 17th level.

**Effect** After spending an hour meditating, you can ask one question of the region's spirits, as if you had just performed a [[Spells/Commune|Commune]] ritual. Attempt a `DC 30 Nature check` check to determine the result.
