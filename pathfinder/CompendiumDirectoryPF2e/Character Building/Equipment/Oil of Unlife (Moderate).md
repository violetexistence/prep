This thin, black liquid imparts a bone-deep chill while rapidly repairing an undead creature's physical or spiritual form. When you dash _oil of unlife_ onto an undead creature, or a living creature with void healing, the oil absorbs quickly into its body, and the creature regains 3d8+10 Hit Points. You can pour _oil of unlife_ on an incorporeal undead; in this case, the creature absorbs the oil into itself.
