**Activate—Cultivate** `pf2:2` (manipulate)

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** You plant the _greater primeval mistletoe_ into an area of natural earth or stone. Once planted, the plant immediately sprouts into an area of holly bushes that don't impede movement and that pulse with vitality energy, replicating the effects of a [[Spells/Field of Life|Field of Life]] spell. You can Sustain the activation up to 1 minute. When this magic ends, the holly bushes revert back into the original _greater primeval mistletoe_.
