# Dragon Turtle Artillery
## Item 10
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[magical]]


**Price** 1000 gp; 
**Bulk** 3; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-two-hands

One end of this heavy cylinder of steel has been forged in the likeness of a dragon turtle's head, the mouth gaping wide. Grips at the opposite end allow one to hold and aim this heavy cannon-like barrel with both hands. As long as you're carrying dragon turtle artillery while you're on a boat or ship, the DC for any effect to capsize that vehicle increases by 4.

**Activate** `pf2:2` command, Interact

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** A 50-foot cone of steam blasts from the mouth of the cannon, dealing 10d6 fire damage to creatures in its area of effect (`DC 27 Reflex check` save). This blast ignores the fire resistance normally granted to creatures by being underwater.
