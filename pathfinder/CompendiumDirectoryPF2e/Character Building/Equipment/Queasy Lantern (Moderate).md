# Queasy Lantern (Moderate)
## Item 12
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[light]][[magical]]


**Price** 1700 gp; 
**Bulk** 1; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

This [[Equipment/Lantern (Bull's Eye)|Lantern (Bull's Eye)]] is wrapped in decrepit leather skin. It constantly emits light in a 60-foot cone (and dim light in the next 60 feet). You can close or open internal shutters with an Interact action to block or reveal the light.

* * *

**Activate** `pf2:2` Interact

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You slide in a magical lens that causes the lantern to emit a pale green light and then aim the lantern. All creatures in the lantern's 60-foot cone of bright light (but not those in the dim light), must attempt a `DC 29 Fortitude check` save. On a failure, a creature becomes [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]] ([[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 3]] on a critical failure). The light then reverts to normal as the lens slides out of place.
