# Corrosive (Greater)
## Item 15
### [[acid]][[magical]]


**Price** 6500 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** etched-onto-a-weapon

Acid sizzles across the surface of the weapon. When you hit with the weapon, add 1d6 acid damage to the damage dealt. In addition, on a critical hit, the target's armor (if any) takes 6d6 acid damage (before applying Hardness); if the target has a shield raised, the shield takes this damage instead.

The acid damage dealt by this weapon ignores the target's acid resistance.
