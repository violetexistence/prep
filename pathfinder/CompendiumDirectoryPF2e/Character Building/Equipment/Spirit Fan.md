This elegant black, gold-tipped _+1 striking fighting fan_ is adorned with images of three golden leaves and a red rope tassel. If a creature is reduced to 0 Hit Points by a _spirit fan_, the golden leaves on the fan light up, providing illumination equal to that of a torch for 1 minute.

**Activate** `pf2:2` envision

**Requirements** The _spirit fan_'s leaves are illuminated

**Frequency** once per hour

**Effect** You sweep the _spirit fan_ in the direction of a single target you can see within 30 feet, releasing the life energy in the form of a streak of golden light. The spirit fan goes dark. If the target is a living creature, the energy restores 3d8+8 healing Hit Points. If the target is undead, it takes 2d8+8 vitality damage (`DC 23 Fortitude check` save).
