# Sanguine Mutagen (Major)
## Item 17
### [[alchemical]][[consumable]][[elixir]][[mutagen]][[polymorph]]

**Category** mutagen; 
**Price** 3000 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

**Activate** `pf2:1` (manipulate)

* * *

For 1 hour you gain greatly increased blood production, filtering out contagions and boosting your endurance but causing your body to bloat with blood.

**Benefit** You gain a +4 item bonus to Fortitude and Reflex saves. When you roll a success on a save against a disease, poison, or effect that would give you the [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]] condition, you get a critical success instead and your critical failures on such saves become failures instead.

**Drawback** Whenever you take piercing or slashing damage, you take 1d6 bleed.
