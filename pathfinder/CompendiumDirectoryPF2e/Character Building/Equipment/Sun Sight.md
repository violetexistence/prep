**Effect** The tattoo casts a 4th-rank [[Spells/Blazing Bolt|Blazing Bolt]], with the rays emitting from your eyes. The number of actions you spend Activating the tattoo determines _blazing bolt_'s number of rays. The tattoo also attempts to dispel each illusion on a creature hit by a ray (counteract rank 5th, counteract modifier +19).
