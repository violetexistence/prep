You can throw a _stalagmite seed_, use it as a sling stone, or pack it into firearm ammunition. When you use the seed, you aim it at a 5-foot square rather than a specific target. Stalagmites of assorted sizes erupt in the square the seed lands in, dealing 6d6 piercing damage to any creature within that space (`DC 23 Reflex check` save). The stalagmites remain for 1 minute, creating difficult terrain in that space, before they crumble into dust.
