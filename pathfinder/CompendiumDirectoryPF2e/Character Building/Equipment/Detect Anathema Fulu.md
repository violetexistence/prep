# Detect Anathema Fulu
## Item 8
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[consumable]][[fulu]][[magical]][[talisman]]

**Category** fulu; 
**Price** 100 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** affixed-to-armor

Given to undisciplined acolytes at risk of breaking their vows, this fulu activates on its own if its wearer begins to perform an act anathema to a specific deity or cause, decided at the time of crafting. The fulu heats up when activated, giving you enough warning to correct your actions; if you proceed, the fulu immolates in a burst of flame. This deals 4d6 fire damage and brands your skin until you receive an appropriate [[Spells/Atone|Atone]] ritual. Either way, activating the fulu consumes it.

**Usage** affixed to armor
