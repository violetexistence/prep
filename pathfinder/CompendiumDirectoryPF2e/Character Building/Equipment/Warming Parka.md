Only a fool would march an army into a freezing climate without adequate protection. This thick parka with a hood protects you from even the harshest of conditions. You negate the damage from severe environmental cold, reduce the damage from extreme cold to that of severe cold, and reduce the damage from incredible cold to extreme cold.

**Effect** You draw the hood of your warming parka closed to fend off the cold as much as possible. For the next minute, you gain resistance 3 to cold damage, but also take a –2 item penalty to Perception checks. You can Dismiss this effect.
