# Druid's Crown
## Item 6
### [[invested]][[primal]]


**Price** 220 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** wornheadwear

Made of materials scavenged from wild places, a _druid's crown_ can be rebuilt for a variety of benefits. The crown grants you a +1 item bonus to a skill, and can be activated to cast a spell, both depending on the material used to build the crown, as listed on the table below. If you invest and wear _living mantle_ along with the crown, the crown's item bonus increases by 1 and its spell's DC rises to 27.

You can invest this item only if you're a druid. When you do, as a 10-minute activity that has the manipulate trait, you can disassemble and rebuild the crown with different materials, changing its item bonus and spell accordingly.

* * *

**Activate** `pf2:2` (concentrate)

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** The crown casts its spell at 2nd rank (DC 20).

**Craft Requirements** You are a druid.
