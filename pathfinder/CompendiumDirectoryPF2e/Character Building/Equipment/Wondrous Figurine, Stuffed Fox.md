This small toy fox has tufted, fluffy ears and buttons for eyes. When activated, it transforms into a big fox with the statistics of a [[Monster Core/Riding Dog|Riding Dog]]. The stuffed fox always allows you to ride it. While you do, you don't take the -2 penalty to Reflex saves while being mounted, and its jaws Strike gains [[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Knockdown|Knockdown]]. The stuffed fox can be activated once a day and remains in its form for up to 1 hour.
