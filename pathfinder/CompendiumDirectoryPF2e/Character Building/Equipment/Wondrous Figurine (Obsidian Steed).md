# Wondrous Figurine (Obsidian Steed)
## Item 15
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[magical]]


**Price** 6000 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

This sinister-looking black statuette resembles a horse rearing up on its hind legs.

When activated, this figurine becomes a [[Monster Core/Nightmare|Nightmare]].

It can be called upon once per week for up to 24 hours, though it won't use [[Spells/Interplanar Teleport|Interplanar Teleport]] or its other abilities on behalf of its rider.

Although evil, it allows itself to be ridden by creatures of any alignment, although if a good creature mounts it, the rider must attempt a `DC 3 Flat check`. On a failure, the nightmare uses [[Spells/Interplanar Teleport|Interplanar Teleport]] to take the rider to a random location in the Abyss, where it promptly returns to statue form, stranding its rider in that nightmarish place.
