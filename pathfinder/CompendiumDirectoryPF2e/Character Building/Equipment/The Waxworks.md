The Waxworks represents helplessness and entropy. As long as you have this card invested, you gain a +2 item bonus to saving throws against effects that render you [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy]], [[Conditions/Doomed|Doomed]], [[Conditions/Drained|Drained]], [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled]], or [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]]. The item bonus increases to +3 if you are 20th level.

**Activate** `pf2:2` envision, Interact

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You cause two 30-foot lines of hot wax to extend out of the card as you present it. The two lines must both start at you and extend in different directions. If you are at least 15th level, you can create a third line, and if you're at least 19th level you can create a fourth line. All creatures in the area must attempt a `Fortitude check` save against your class DC or spell DC.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature takes 2d6 persistent fire + 2d6 persistent mental damage. An affected creature or adjacent ally can reduce both of these values by 1d6 by spending an Interact action to scrape off the goo. Until the damage is reduced to 1d6 per type, the affected creature is also [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]] (this is an emotion and mental effect).

**Failure** As success, but 4d6 persistent fire + 4d6 persistent mental damage.

**Critical Failure** As success, but 6d6 persistent fire + 6d6 persistent mental damage, and the creature's speed is [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] until the damage is reduced to 1d6 per type.
