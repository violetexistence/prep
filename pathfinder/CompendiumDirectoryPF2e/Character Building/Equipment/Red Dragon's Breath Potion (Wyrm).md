# Red Dragon's Breath Potion (Wyrm)
## Item 17
### [[consumable]][[fire]][[magical]][[potion]]

**Category** potion; 
**Price** 3000 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

This liquid contains blood from a red dragon. For 1 hour after you imbibe the concoction, you can unleash a red dragon's breath weapon. The potency of the breath depends on the potion's type, based on the age of the dragon whose blood was used to make the potion.

Exhaling dragon breath uses a single action. You create a 15-foot cone of fire which deals 10d6 fire damage. All creatures in the area must attempt a `DC 37 Reflex check` save.

After you use the breath weapon, you can't do so again for 1d4 rounds.
