This oily mix of herbs and natural detergents can be applied to a creature to reduce and cover any ordinary odors they produce. The creature receives a +2 item bonus to Stealth checks to [[Actions/Hide|Hide]] or [[Actions/Sneak|Sneak]] against creatures using primarily smell. This bonus also applies to the DC to [[Actions/Track|Track]] the creature by scent. The listed amount is enough to cover one Medium or smaller creature and takes 1 minute to apply.
