Each of these arrows is made from an immense roc's flight feather, most of whose vanes have been trimmed to expose the arrow's shaft. When an activated roc-shaft arrow hits a target, the arrow briefly grows a pair of avian wings and attempts to carry off the target. The target must succeed at a `DC 34 Fortitude check` save or be moved to a space you choose within 20 feet (30 feet on a critical failure). If this would move the target into a hazardous space, this effect gains the incapacitation trait.
