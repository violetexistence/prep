# Thousand-Pains Fulu (Needle)
## Item 11
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[consumable]][[fulu]][[magical]]

**Category** fulu; 
**Price** 270 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** affixed-to-a-creature

**Duration** 1 minute

Created by a chirurgeon who threw away morality in search of endless life, a _thousand-pains fulu_ blocks the natural flow of elements in the body. A creature to which the fulu is affixed must attempt a `DC 27 Fortitude check`. Failure or critical failure primes the target for persistent damage triggered by a specific condition that must be met within the fulu's duration.

Picking up this white fulu feels like you've stabbed your hand with a pin. The fulu deals 7d6 piercing as hair, nails, and connective tissues stab inward. On a failure or critical failure, if the target then takes an action with the move trait, it takes 2d6 persistent piercing.
