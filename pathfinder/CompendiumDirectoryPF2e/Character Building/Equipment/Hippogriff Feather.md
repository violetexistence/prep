Tawny-colored hippogriff feathers can be up to 2 feet long. Used as a catalyst with a [[Spells/Ghostly Carrier|Ghostly Carrier]] spell, a single _hippogriff feather_ grants the hand semicorporeal wings that increase the hand's maneuverability. The hand has a range of only 60 feet, but its increased agility grants it a +1 status bonus to its AC and Reflex saves.
