# Feather of Unfounded Bravado
## Item 2
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[magical]]


**Price** 30 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

This large feather is garishly colored in reds, oranges, and yellows, but on closer inspection, it's simply a particularly large chicken feather that's been dyed. Carrying the feather provides a boost to your self-confidence, but it might lead you into dangerous situations.

**Activate—Overconfident Facade** `pf2:2` (concentrate)

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** For 1 hour, the feather grants you a +1 item bonus to Intimidation checks to [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] and Diplomacy checks to [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]], but a –1 item penalty on Acrobatics and Athletics checks, as your inflated confidence leads you to attempt things you simply cannot do.
