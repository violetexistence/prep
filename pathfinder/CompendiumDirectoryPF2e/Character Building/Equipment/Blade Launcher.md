# Blade Launcher
## Item 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")


**Price** 18 gp; 
**Bulk** 1; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-two-hands

A blade launcher has a bow-like assembly mounted on a handled frame. The frame can be configured to fire either a dagger, dart, shuriken, or starknife. Configuring a blade launcher requires three Interact actions. Once properly configured, loading an appropriate thrown weapon into a blade launcher requires a single Interact action. A blade launcher can't fire weapons for which it's not currently configured. A weapon fired with a blade launcher loses the agile, monk, thrown, and versatile traits, if it has them, and has a range increment of 40 feet. Due to losing the thrown weapon trait, returning and most other effects that allow a weapon to return don't function; even if a launched weapon did return, you'd still need to load it into the blade launcher with an Interact action to fire the blade launcher again.
