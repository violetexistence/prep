# Satchel of Numberless Seeds
## Item 8
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[magical]]


**Price** 480 gp; 
**Bulk** 1; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

This satchel is made of finely worked leather and stitched with golden thread. A complex pattern of trees, leaves, and vines covers its surface. The satchel always contains a bulk of seeds, and drawing one from the bag results in a random tree or crop plant seed.

**Activate—Seed of Safety** `pf2:2` (manipulate, primal)

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You draw a seed and cast it into a space within 30 feet. The satchel casts protector tree (Player Core 2 249) as a 2nd-rank spell.

**Activate—Seed of Sustenance** `pf2:2` (healing, manipulate, primal)

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You draw a seed and cast it into a space within 30 feet. A small tree sprouts within 10 minutes, producing 5 fruits. A creature who eats the fruit with an Interact action regains 1d6+2 healing Hit Points and receives as much nourishment as one meal for a typical human. After an hour, the tree and all its fruits wither away.
