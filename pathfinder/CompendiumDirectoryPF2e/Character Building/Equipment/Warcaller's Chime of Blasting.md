This chime features carvings of destructive runes. When activated, it creates the effects of a 3rd-rank [[Spells/Noise Blast|Noise Blast]] centered on you (`DC 20 Fortitude check` save). Instead of the spell's normal range, it has a 5-foot emanation. In addition, creatures that critically fail their save are knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] by the chime's effect. You can use this chime once per day.
