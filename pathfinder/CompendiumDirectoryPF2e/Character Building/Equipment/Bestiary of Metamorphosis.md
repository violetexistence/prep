## Item 6
### [[grimoire]][[magical]]


**Price** 210 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

This grimoire fancifully illustrates the spells you inscribe within it with illuminated drawings of creatures that have never existed, the pictures changing to depict new ones from time to time.

* * *

**Activate** `pf2:1` envision (polymorph, transmutation)

**Frequency** once per day

**Requirements** You're under the effect of a polymorph spell you prepared from this grimoire that offers a choice of multiple forms

* * *

**Effect** You transform into a different form allowed by the polymorph by bending and molding the spell's energy. This reduces the spell's remaining duration by half.
