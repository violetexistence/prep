This black cooking pot can produce a feast fit for undead.

* * *

**Activate** `pf2:3` Interact

**Frequency** once per day

**Requirements** The cauldron must be filled with water, herbs, bones, and raw meat, and kept at a boil for 1 hour

* * *

**Effect** As you stir the cauldron, its contents transform into 10 meals suitable for undead consumption. Each meal must be ladled from the cauldron individually as a 3-action activity and must be eaten within 1 hour of removal. An undead creature that consumes a meal from the cauldron regains 5d8 Hit Points and gains the benefits of 4th-rank [[Spells/Restoration|Restoration]] that you choose; living creatures who consume a meal from the cauldron take 5d8 void damage (`DC 27 Fortitude check`) instead. Any meals remaining in the cauldron 24 hours after activation become inedible slurry.
