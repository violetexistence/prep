# Lion's Armor
## Item 12
### [[invested]][[magical]]

**Category** heavy; **Group** plate
**Price** 2000 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** wornarmor

Various parts of this +2 _resilient half plate_ are forged into the shape of a lion's head. The golden lion heads grant you a commanding presence and seem to actively growl at your enemies, granting you a +2 item bonus to Intimidation.

The lions on the armor work in tandem with the lion on a _lion's shield_. If you critically hit with the _lion's shield_ using Lion Bite, the lions on the armor roar in support of the shield, causing the target of the shield's Strike to become [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]].

**Activateâ€”Roar of the Pride** `pf2:2` (concentrate)

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** The lions on your armor roar, attempting to cow your enemies. Attempt a check to [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] each enemy within 30 feet of you. On a critical success, the target is also [[Conditions/Fleeing|Fleeing]] for 1 round.
