This palm-sized chunk of wood it rotting, and riddled with mold and fungi. You can crush this wood to use it as a spell catalyst when you cast a [[Spells/Oaken Resilience|Oaken Resilience]]. When you do, the bark that covers your skin is rotting, and emits a small cloud of spores whenever your hurt. For the duration, whenever you take physical damage, your rotting bark skin emits a cloud of spores in a 5-foot emanation. Creatures in the area must attempt a `DC 21 Fortitude check` save to avoid taking 1d4 poison damage.
