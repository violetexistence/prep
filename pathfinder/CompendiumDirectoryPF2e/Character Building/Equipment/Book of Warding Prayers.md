Script in a language of the Outer Planes adorns this book's spine, and a deity's symbol is etched on its cover. _Books of warding prayers_ are each devoted to a particular deity and are also a religious symbol of that deity.

**Effect** You and all your allies in a 30-foot emanation gain resistance 10 to spirit damage for 1 minute.
