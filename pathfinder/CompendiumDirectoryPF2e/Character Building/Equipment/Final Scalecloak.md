# Final Scalecloak
## Item 20
### [unique](unique "Unique Rarity Trait")[[artifact]][[invested]][[magical]][[mythic]]


**Price** 0 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** worncloak

Fashioned from a swath of Mogaru's red-and-black hide and trimmed with Agyra's rough scales in green, blue, and white, this cloak draws upon the power of both kaiju, but at considerable cost. Any kaiju within a 5-mile radius of the _Final Scalecloak_ can sense the presence and nature of the item, and can also determine whether it's being worn by a mortal. This sense grows stronger as the item and kaiju near one another, until the kaiju can pinpoint exactly where the cloak is and who currently possesses it.

When worn, the _Final Scalecloak_ grants you resistance 15 to physical and precision damage, immunity to electricity, and a Fly speed of 60 feet. You are unaffected by strong winds while flying.

**Activate—Commune with Kaiju** `pf2:2` (concentrate, manipulate, primal)

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** Spend a Mythic Point; you gain the effects of a 6th-rank [[Spells/Telepathy|Telepathy]] spell but can use it only to communicate with Gargantuan animals and beasts. Most kaiju are hostile toward you for wearing the _Final Scalecloak_, however, requiring great effort to calm them enough to have a conversation.

**Activate—Embody the Storm** `pf2:2` (concentrate, manipulate, primal)

**Frequency** once per hour

**Effect** Spend a Mythic Point; a nimbus of crackling electricity surrounds you for 1 minute. You gain a +4 status bonus to AC against ranged projectiles that are at least partly made of metal. If a foe attempts to Strike you with an unarmed attack or melee attack with a weapon at least partly made of metal, that creature takes 3d10 electricity damage (`DC 40 Reflex check` save).

**Destruction** The _Final Scalecloak_ is torn to shreds if the wearer is struck by an attack or effect from both Agyra and Mogaru within the same round.
