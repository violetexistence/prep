# Feather Token (Swan Boat) (Ammunition)
## Item 10
### [[consumable]][[magical]]

**Category** ammo; 
**Price** 152 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

Each feather token appears to be a simple feather from some exotic bird. The feather's shaft, dipped in gold, bears a single arcane rune. Activating a feather token causes it to transform into another object, which then can be used as normal for that object. Each feather can be activated only once, with most of them permanently becoming the item in their description.

**Activate** `pf2:1` Strike from a ranged weapon

This feather can be activated only when shot into a large body of water, such as a lake or broad river. It transforms into a swan-shaped boat capable of carrying up to 32 Medium creatures, 8 Large creatures, or 2 Huge creatures. The boat moves on the water at a Speed of 50 feet, and lasts 1 day.
