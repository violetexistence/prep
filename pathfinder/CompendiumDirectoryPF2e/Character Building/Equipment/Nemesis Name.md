# Nemesis Name
## Item 9
### [[invested]][[magical]][[tattoo]]


**Price** 650 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** tattooed-on-the-body

You want revenge badly enough that you tattoo your nemesis's name in a place you can easily see to remember your vow to settle the score. Anyone who sees the tattoo senses your hatred of the named being. Receiving a new nemesis name makes any you already have non-magical. You gain a +2 status bonus to damage rolls against the creature named on your tattoo, but this nemesis gains a +1 status bonus to damage rolls against you.

**Activate** `pf2:1` (concentrate, mental)

**Frequency** once per round

**Requirements** You can see your nemesis, and they're within 30 feet of you

* * *

**Effect** You focus your hatred into a mental scream. Your nemesis takes 3d6 mental damage, which they can resist with a basic `DC 26 Will check` save. You take half as much damage as your nemesis does, and you can't reduce this damage in any way.
