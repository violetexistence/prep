**Category** wand;

* * *

**Effect** You cast [[Spells/Force Barrage|Force Barrage]] at 3rd rank.

After you cast the spell, an additional shard or shards are released from the wand at the start of each of your turns, as though you cast the 1-action version of _force barrage_. Choose targets each time. This lasts for 1 minute, until you're no longer wielding the wand, or until you try to activate the wand again.

**Craft Requirements** Supply a casting of _force barrage_ of the appropriate rank.
