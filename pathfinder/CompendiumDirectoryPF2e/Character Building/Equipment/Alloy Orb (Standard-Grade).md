Although solid, this orb of metal swirls with bright silver and dark iron colors, as if made of liquid. When you activate the _alloy orb_, select cold iron or silver. The affixed weapon functions as the chosen material for 1 minute, suppressing its original material. This orb works on weapons of 15th level or lower.
