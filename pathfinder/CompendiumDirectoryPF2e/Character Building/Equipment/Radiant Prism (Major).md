## Item 20
### [[magical]][[spellheart]]


**Price** 64000 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** affixed-to-armor-or-a-weapon

This glass prism pays homage to its namesake pantheonâ€”the Radiant Prism of Sarenrae, Desna, and Shelyn. Any armor or weapon the prism is affixed to glows softly with colored lights. The spell DC of any spell cast by activating this item is 43.

*   **Armor** (light) After you cast a non-cantrip spell by activating the prism, you glow with dim light in a multitude of shimmering hues, shedding light like a [[Equipment/Torch|Torch]] and making you [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] for 2 rounds.
*   **Weapon** After you cast a non-cantrip spell by activating the prism, your Strikes with the weapon gain the [[Equipment/Brilliant (Greater)|Greater Brilliant]] property rune until the end of your next turn. The damage from the _greater brilliant_ rune increases to 3d4 of each type.
