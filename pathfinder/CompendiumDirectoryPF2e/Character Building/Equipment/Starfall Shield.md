### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[magical]]


**Price** 23000 gp; 
**Bulk** 1; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

This high-grade adamantine heavy rondache (Hardness 17, HP 100, BT 50) bears a _+3 greater striking shield boss_ and has dents that resemble craters on its surface. While wielding the shield, you have fire resistance 15.

**Activate** `pf2:1` (manipulate)

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You Stride up to three times. This movement doesn't trigger reactions and ignores difficult terrain. At the end of your movement, you deal 6d10 bludgeoning in a 10-foot emanation and 14d6 fire in a 40-foot emanation (`DC 40 Reflex check`, with the results applying to both the bludgeoning and fire damage). The space where you end your movement and all adjacent spaces become difficult terrain for 1 minute, and the shield glows red-hot for 10 minutes, during which it gains the effect of the greater flaming property rune.
