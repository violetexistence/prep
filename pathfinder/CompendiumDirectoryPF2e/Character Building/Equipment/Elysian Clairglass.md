# Elysian Clairglass
## Item 17
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[magical]][[scrying]]


**Price** 14000 gp; 
**Bulk** 1; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-two-hands

Used by soldiers who battle on the borderlands of Elysium, particularly in Gorum's realm of Clashing Shore, these bronze spyglasses are somewhat plain-looking save for a single diamond set into the largest cylinder. An _Elysian clairglass_ functions like a typical spyglass, but you can see twenty times farther while looking through it, rather than eight times farther. It also grants a +3 item bonus to Perception checks to notice details at a distance.

**Activate—Seek and Speak** `pf2:2` (concentrate)

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** The _Elysian clairglass_ casts clairaudience and clairvoyance on the area you are currently observing with it. As long as you're holding the _Elysian clairglass_, you can speak through the floating eye or ear created by its spells, causing your voice to manifest as a whisper that only one person in range of the spells can hear, as a booming voice that everyone in range of the spells can hear, or as any combination in between those two extremes.

**Activate—Pinpoint** `pf2:2` (concentrate, manipulate)

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** You cast [[Spells/Pinpoint|Pinpoint]].
