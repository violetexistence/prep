# Avalanche Boots
## Item 17
### [[apex]][[invested]][[magical]]


**Price** 15000 gp; 
**Bulk** 1; **Size** med
**Usage** wornshoes

While the insides of these boots are comfortable, fur-lined leather, the outsides are a jumble of slate plates, giving the impression of a rockslide. You gain a +3 item bonus to Athletics checks and a +2 circumstance bonus to [[Actions/Force Open|Force Open]] and [[Actions/Shove|Shove]]. When you invest the boots, you either increase your Strength modifier by 1 or increase it to +4, whichever would give you a higher value.

**Activate** `pf2:0` (concentrate)

**Frequency** once per hour

**Trigger** You succeed or critically succeed with a Shove

* * *

**Effect** If the Shove was a success, you push your opponent up to 10 feet instead of 5 feet. If the Shove was a critical success, you push your opponent up to 20 feet, and you can then choose to knock them [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]].
