**Effect** You call upon the ferocity and grace of the leopard. The armor's rings flatten out to become a solid piece of flexible armor. You gain a +2 item bonus to Stealth checks and Intimidation checks to [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]], but take a -2 penalty to Diplomacy and Society checks.

This lasts for 1 hour, but you can Activate the armor again to revert it back to its original form.
