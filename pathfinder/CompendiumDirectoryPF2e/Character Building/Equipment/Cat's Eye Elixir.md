After you consume this elixir, your vision sharpens and you become sensitive to even the most minute movements.

For the next minute, you reduce the flat check to target [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] creatures to `DC 5 Flat check`, and you don't need to attempt a flat check to target [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] creatures. These benefits apply only against creatures within 30 feet of you.
