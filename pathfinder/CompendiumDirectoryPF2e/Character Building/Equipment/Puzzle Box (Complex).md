# Puzzle Box (Complex)
## Item 1
### 


**Price** 2 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

A puzzle box features moving parts, locking mechanisms, and other components designed to confound the user. Solving a puzzle box typically requires three successful DC 20 Games Lore or `DC 20 Thievery check` checks to Open a Lock, though puzzle boxes come in countless configurations and themes, and the GM can determine which skills are appropriate.
