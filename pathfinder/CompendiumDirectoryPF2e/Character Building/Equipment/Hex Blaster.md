This _+2 striking fearsome arquebus_ is composed of warped and twisted wood engraved with eerie runes. When the weapon fires, the blast sometimes sounds like the cackling of a diabolical witch.

**Activate** `pf2:1` command

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** You afflict a creature you can see with a hex of impending doom. The hex lasts for 1 minute. As long as the creature is hexed, when you hit it with a round from the hex blaster, the creature must attempt a `DC 28 Will check` save at the end of your turn; the creature attempts a single Will save regardless of the number of times you hit it.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]]. It also takes 1d6 persistent mental damage.

**Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]]. It also takes 2d6 persistent mental damage.

**Critical Failure** The creature is frightened 2 and [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] for 1 minute. It also takes 4d6 persistent mental damage and is cursed with a hex of impending doom. If the target falls [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]] from damage dealt by this Strike or the persistent mental damage, it remains unconscious for 1 day or until this curse is removed. After 1 day, if the creature is still unconscious, it must succeed at a `DC 28 Fortitude check` save or die; this effect has the death and incapacitation traits.
