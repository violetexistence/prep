While this sinister-looking weapon isn't inherently evil, its unsettling appearance and powers particularly appeal to those who revel in causing pain. A grisly scythe has a twisted thorny haft and a blade that appears to be rusted, but it functions as a _+1 striking wounding scythe_.

**Activate** `pf2:r` command

**Frequency** once per hour

**Trigger** Your attack roll with the grisly scythe is a critical success

**Effect** Instead of inflicting slashing damage with the grisly scythe, you inflict void damage. You regain a number of hit points equal to half the void damage inflicted, and the creature struck becomes [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] from the agony.
