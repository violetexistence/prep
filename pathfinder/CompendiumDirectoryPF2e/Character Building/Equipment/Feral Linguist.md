This wooden whistle is stuffed with cotton and carved with images of bellowing stags, howling wolves, and chirping birds. You can blow on this whistle to use it as a catalyst when casting an [[Spells/Animal Form|Animal Form]] spell. When you do, you retain the ability to speak, though this doesn't allow you to cast spells.
