_The Joke_ represents solving a problem not with strength, but with cleverness or artifice. As long as you have _The Joke_ invested, you can attempt an appropriate Lore check instead of an Athletics check made to [[Actions/Climb|Climb]], [[Actions/Force Open|Force Open]], [[Actions/Grapple|Grapple]], [[Actions/High Jump|High Jump]], [[Actions/Long Jump|Long Jump]], or [[Actions/Swim|Swim]]. For example, you could make a Mountain Lore check to climb a cliff in the mountains, or Sailing Lore check to climb the rigging on a ship.

**Activate** `pf2:2` envision, Interact

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You perform a quick but amusing card trick with The Joke meant to distract others. You cast [[Spells/Laughing Fit|Laughing Fit]] on up to 10 creatures in range of the spell. The rank of the spell is one-half your level rounded down (minimum 6th level), and the save DC is your class DC (`Will check`).
