# Rebounding Breastplate
## Item 20
### [[force]][[invested]][[magical]]

**Category** medium; **Group** plate
**Price** 70000 gp; 
**Bulk** 2; **Size** med
**Usage** wornarmor

This _+3 greater resilient greater fortification breastplate_ absorbs impacts for later release. While wearing the armor, you gain resistance 5 to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage and resistance 10 to force damage. Keep track of how much damage the armor prevents from enemy attacks, as the armor absorbs that damage.

After 1 minute, the absorbed damage disperses harmlessly and resets to 0. Only damage caused by foes or hazards powers the armor, not damage you take from yourself, allies, or the environment.

**Activate** `pf2:1` Interact

**Requirements** Your armor has absorbed at least 30 damage

**Effect** The absorbed energy explodes from your armor in a pulse of force. Creatures in a 30-foot emanation take 10d6 force damage with a `DC 43 Fortitude check` save. On a failure, they're pushed 10 feet away from you, and on a critical failure, they're pushed 20 feet away from you and fall [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]. The armor's absorbed damage resets to 0.
