This umbrella's ferrule is a hollow-tipped blade three to four inches in length and often overlooked as decorative. A receptacle inside the umbrella's shaft can be loaded with a single dose of injury poison and injected into a damaged target with the pull of a sliding trigger. Reinforced ribs enable you to parry and deflect blows with the umbrella's tear-resistant canopy.
