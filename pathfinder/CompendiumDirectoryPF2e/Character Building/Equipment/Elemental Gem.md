# Elemental Gem
## Item 10
### [[consumable]][[magical]]

**Category** other; 
**Price** 200 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

**Activate** `pf2:2` Command, Interact

You shout the name of an elemental lord and dash this glassy gem against a hard surface to activate it. It cracks open, casting a 5th-rank [[Spells/Summon Elemental|Summon Elemental]] spell to summon forth an elemental you control as long as you spend an action each round to Sustain the Activation.

This gem comes in four varieties: transparent for a living whirlwind, light brown for a living landslide, reddish orange for a living wildfire, and blue-green for a living waterfall.
