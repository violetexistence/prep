A broad wooden tube with a handle, a _sparking spellgun_ radiates warmth. You Activate the spellgun by aiming it at one creature and making your choice of a spell attack roll or a firearm attack roll against the target's AC. This spellgun has a range increment of 30 feet. The spellgun fires a small ball of sparks and fire, then crumbles to ash. The ball explodes in a flash when it hits, dealing 7d6 fire damage and 3d4 persistent fire damage.

**Critical Success** The target takes double damage, takes double persistent damage, is [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] for 1 round, and is [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] while the persistent damage lasts.

**Success** The target takes full damage, full persistent damage, and is dazzled while the persistent damage lasts.
