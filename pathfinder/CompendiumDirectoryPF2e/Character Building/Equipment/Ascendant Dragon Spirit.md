This masterfully crafted spirit is mixed into a potent magical cocktail and packaged in a gourd with an engraving of a forest dragon coiling around it. Drinking it imparts an intriguing balance of woodsmoke, honey, and bright floral notes on the back end. When consumed, your arms become infused with the deadly power of a forest dragon. For 1 minute, your unarmed Strikes deal an additional 1d6 poison damage and an additional 1d6 void damage.
