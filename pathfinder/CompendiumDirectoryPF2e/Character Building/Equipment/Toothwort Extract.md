**Trigger** You use Quick Alchemy to craft an alchemical poison that's at least 1 level lower than your advanced alchemy level.

Originally used in dental procedures, toothwort numbs the gums by deadening nerves. When the oils are extracted and distilled, toothwort has a secondary reputation among alchemists for enhancing the duration of poisons. When adding toothwort extract to an alchemical poison, you can extend the maximum duration of the poison by 1 round.
