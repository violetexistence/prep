You can toss sneezing powder at an adjacent creature as an Interact action. The target must attempt a `DC 15 Fortitude check` save to avoid sneezing. On a failed save, the creature sneezes uncontrollably, becoming [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] for 1 round. On a critical failure, the creature is instead slowed 1 for 3 rounds.
