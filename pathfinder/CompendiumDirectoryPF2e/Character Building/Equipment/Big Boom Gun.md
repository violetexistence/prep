Developed by a goblin weaponsmith who missed the "hand" part of "hand cannon," this comically oversized gun has a heavily reinforced barrel and is loaded with a worrisome quantity of gunpowder. This hand cannon is a martial weapon instead of a simple weapon. It has the fatal d12 trait and a range increment of 20 feet. It also has the following modified critical failure condition.

**Critical Failure** The attack misses, the weapon misfires, and you take 1d12 fire damage as it explodes in your face.
