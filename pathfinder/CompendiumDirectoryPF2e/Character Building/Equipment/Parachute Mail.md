Favored by soldiers deployed on airships, this chain mail has a built-in parachute connected to the armor itself, with an additional harness to be worn underneath. It takes 10 minutes and a successful `DC 15 Crafting check` check to successfully repack the parachute.

**Frequency** once until repacked

**Effect** Once activated, the parachute will fully deploy within 1 round. If it is deployed at a height greater than 100 feet, the parachute will prevent you from receiving falling damage. If deployed at a height of less than 100 feet, it will reduce the damage taken from falling by half.
