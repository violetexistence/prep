A layer of vapor swirls just below the surface of this glass container holding a large, dried heap of fungal-encrusted seaweed. You can throw the phial up to 30 feet when you Activate it. When opened or thrown, a Medium sargassum heap effigy reconstitutes to release a hallucinogenic cloud in a 15-foot emanation, forcing each creature to attempt a `DC 20 Fortitude check` save. On a failure, a creature rolls 1d4 rounds (unless otherwise noted). At the beginning of their turn, an affected creature attempts a new save.

**1** The target thinks they are sinking through the floor. It falls [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] and spends 1 action on its next turn flailing its limbs as if attempting to swim.

**2** The target thinks an item they are holding turns into a viper. The target Releases the item and spends its next turn [[Conditions/Fleeing|Fleeing]] from it.

**3** The target thinks they have shrunk to 1/10 their normal size. For 1 round, it is [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 2]], [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 2]], and takes a â€“10-foot status penalty to its Speed.

**4** The target believes they are melting. It drops everything it's holding and becomes slowed 2 and [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 2]] for 1 round.

* * *

**Craft Requirements** Supply the corpse of a sargassum heap.
