The blade of this _+2 greater striking [[Equipment/Frost (Greater)|Frost (Greater)]] greatsword_ appears to be nothing but icy shards. The _frost brand_ automatically extinguishes non-magical fires in a 20-foot emanation. While wielding it, you gain fire resistance 5.

**Activate** `pf2:2` command, Interact

**Effect** You swing the _frost brand_ into the area of an ongoing magical fire, and the blade attempts to counteract the fire with a counteract modifier of +27. If it fails, it can't attempt to counteract the same fire again.
