# Splatrope Extruder
## Item 3
### [[alchemical]]


**Price** 50 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

This portable nozzle-and-trigger assembly based on spider spinnerets can extrude and weave alchemical adhesives into temporary constructions. As an Interact action, you can attach a [[Equipment/Glue Bomb (Lesser)|Glue Bomb]] to the extruder.

**Activate** `pf2:1` (manipulate)

**Requirements** A glue bomb is installed in the extruder

* * *

**Effect** The extruder converts the glue bomb into a 30-foot rope, whip, or net, depending on the nozzle die you choose when activating the device. The created object lasts for 1 hour. The DC to [[Actions/Escape|Escape]] a created rope (if used to bind a creature) or net is equal to the consumed glue bomb's DC and Escaping destroys the created object.
