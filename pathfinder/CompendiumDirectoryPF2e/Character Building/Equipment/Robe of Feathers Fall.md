# Robe of Feathers Fall
## Item 8
### [[invested]]


**Price** 0 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** wornclothing

This dashing travel- (and beer-) stained feathered robe is the result of magic experimentation gone awry. Dared to create a robe that would continually cast [[Spells/Gentle Landing|Gentle Landing]] during a brainstorming session at a local pub, a young wizard got the enchantment wrong. Instead of a robe that would let its wearer float through the air, they got....this:

When you first invest the robe, and whenever you make your daily preparations, roll 1d6 and consult the following list to determine the type of feathers. 1: crow; 2: duck; 3: ostrich; 4: chicken; 5: goose; 6: peacock. With each step taken, huge amounts of feathers sprout forth from the robe with great force. The feathers make you [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] from all other creatures, but also conceal all other creatures from you. Of course, you cannot use this concealed condition to [[Actions/Hide|Hide]].
