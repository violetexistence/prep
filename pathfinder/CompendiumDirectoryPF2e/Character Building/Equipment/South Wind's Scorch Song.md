This _+1 striking flaming scimitar_ is always warm to the touch, nearly unbearably so. Lines of crackling flame radiate from carnelians affixed to its curved and blackened blade, and its pommel ends in a brilliant tassel of phoenix feathers. While you have a status bonus to at least one of your Speeds, your Strikes with this scimitar that deal fire damage gain a +2 status bonus to their fire damage. The status bonus increases to +3 if the weapon has a greater striking rune and +4 for major striking.
