These iron rings filled with kaleidoscopic glass are popular among Shelynites. A _chroma kaleidoscope_'s effects last for 1 hour. When you critically Strike a creature with a weapon under the effects of a _chroma kaleidoscope_, a blast of color from the weapon forces them to attempt a `Will check` saving throw against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher, with the following effects.
