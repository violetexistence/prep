The bladed inner curve of this _+2 greater striking keen wounding dagger_ has a jagged, saw-like edge, while its handle is wrapped in red leather. Carved from the mandible of a giant praying mantis, this magical weapon's blade is as sharp and serviceable as steel.

**Effect** You swing the dagger in a wide arc, causing a horizontal swipe of blood-red energy to sweep out in a 30-foot cone. All living creatures in the area take 15d6 slashing damage (`DC 34 Reflex check` save), plus 1d6 bleed damage on a failed save.
