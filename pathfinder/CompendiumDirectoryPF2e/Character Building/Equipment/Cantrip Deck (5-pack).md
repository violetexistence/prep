# Cantrip Deck (5-pack)
## Item 1
### [[magical]]

**Category** other; 
**Price** 5 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

In an effort to spread the knowledge of magic as widely as possible, worshippers of Nethys discovered a way to bind cantrips into cards accessible even to non-spellcasters. The deck contains thick parchment cards, each roughly half the size of a playing card. In precise, no-nonsense script, each card simply states the name of its cantrip, color-coded based on its school.

This pack contains 5 cards of a single common cantrip.

**Activate** `pf2:1` or more (envision, Interact)

* * *

**Effect** You envision your desired cantrip, causing its card to rise to the top of the deck, and draw the card. The deck casts that cantrip as a 1st-rank spell, with a DC of 15 and a spell attack modifier of +5. The card crumbles into dust as the cantrip takes effect. The activation takes the same number of actions as the cantrip you chose takes to cast.
