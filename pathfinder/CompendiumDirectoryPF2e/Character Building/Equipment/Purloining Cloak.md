Each _purloining cloak_ is a [[Equipment/Mercurial Mantle|Mercurial Mantle]] once worn by a legendary thief or two. The cloak became infused with a daredevil spirit and a penchant for high-stakes thievery. If its owner isn't willing to partake in such activities, the cloak tries to convince them to sell or give it to someone who will. A purloining cloak can use tendrils of its cloth to attempt Thievery checks to Palm an Object or [[Actions/Steal|Steal]], proudly offering you its loot later. In addition to those of a mercurial mantle, a purloining cloak has the following activations.

**Trigger** An enemy misses you with a melee Strike

**Effect** You slip around the attacking creature with ease. You Step, without moving away from the triggering enemy, and then make a melee Strike against the triggering enemy if it's within reach. If you do make a Strike, the target attempts a `DC 38 Perception check` check before you roll.

**Critical Failure** This creature is off-guard against all your attacks until the end of their next turn.
