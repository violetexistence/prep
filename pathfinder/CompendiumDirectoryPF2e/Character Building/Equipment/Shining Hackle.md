# Shining Hackle
## Item 4
### [[invested]][[magical]]


**Price** 0 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** wornheadwear

Some troops wear this plume of short feathers in their hats as part of a formal uniform, but the soft glow emanating from it can be useful elsewhere. While wearing the shining hackle, you gain a +1 item bonus to Perception checks based on sight, but you also take a –1 item penalty to your Stealth checks.

**Activate—Glowing Hackle** `pf2:1` (concentrate, light)

**Effect** Your shining hackle glows even brighter, shedding bright light in a 20-foot radius (and dim light for the next 20 feet). This effect lasts until you Dismiss it.
