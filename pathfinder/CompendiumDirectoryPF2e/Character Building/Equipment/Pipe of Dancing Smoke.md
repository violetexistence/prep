# Pipe of Dancing Smoke
## Item 5
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[fire]][[magical]]


**Price** 125 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

This ornate pipe is chiseled from a single bloodstone piece with wooden accents. When in use, the pipe gives off a vibrant red smoke that floats lazily in the air. These pipes are popular among bards and braggarts who like the ostentatious smoke it gives offâ€”and who often use it to create raucous diversions or send indiscreet signals.

**Activate** `pf2:2` Interact

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** The smoke forms a bird that flies up to 120 feet in a direction of your choice. When it collides with a solid object or travels the full range, whichever is shorter, it explodes in a 20-foot burst of smoke with the effects of [[Spells/Mist|Mist]].
