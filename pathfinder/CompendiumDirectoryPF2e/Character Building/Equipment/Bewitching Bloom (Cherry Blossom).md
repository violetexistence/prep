## Item 3
### [[invested]][[magical]][[tattoo]]


**Price** 50 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** tattooed-on-the-body

While dormant, this tattoo appears to be a simple flower bud, but when activated the flower swiftly blossoms, remaining that way until the next time you make your daily preparations. These blooms are colorful, elegant representations of cherry blossoms.

**Activate** `pf2:2` envision

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** Choose a willing ally you can see within 30 feet. The ally understands the fleeting nature of life and accepts fate. For 1 minute, any recovery checks the ally attempts have a DC of 10 instead of 10 + the ally's dying value. The cherry blossom's activation can target an [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]] or dying ally.
