A _socialite staff_ is designed as an ornate cane, its metal body glimmering with jewels and gold inlays. A sculpture carved from obsidian tops the head of the staff, its design depending on its wielder's taste. Common choices include birds, flowers, or family crests. While wielding a socialite staff, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] on members of high society.
