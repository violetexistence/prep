# Devil's Luck
## Item 3
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[contract]][[fortune]][[invested]][[magical]]

**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

**Devil** [[Monster Core/Imp|Imp]]

**Decipher Writing** Arcana, Occultism, Society

* * *

You've bargained with an imp, one of the least powerful devils, for a fragment of infernal luck.

**Benefit** Once per day, you can roll a saving throw twice and use the higher result.

**Payment** At the termination of your mortal life, your soul must serve the imp for 100 years.

**Hidden Condition** The "termination of mortal life" clause is carefully worded to hasten your demise. You can't use the benefit against a death effect, and if you roll a failure on a saving throw against a death effect, you get a critical failure instead.

**Termination Clause** If you critically fail a saving throw against a death effect and do not die, the contract becomes unenforceable on its terms and is voided.
