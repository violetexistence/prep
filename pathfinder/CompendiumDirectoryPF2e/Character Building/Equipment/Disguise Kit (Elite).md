# Disguise Kit (Elite)
## Item 3
### 


**Price** 40 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-two-hands

This small wooden box contains cosmetics, false facial hair, spirit gum, and a few simple wigs. You usually need a disguise kit to set up a disguise in order to Impersonate someone using the Deception skill. An elite disguise kit adds a +1 item bonus to relevant checks. If you've crafted a large number of disguises, you can replenish your cosmetics supply with replacement cosmetics suitable for the type of your disguise kit. You can draw and replace a worn disguise kit as part of the action that uses it.
