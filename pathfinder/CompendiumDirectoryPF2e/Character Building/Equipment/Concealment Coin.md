# Concealment Coin

### 


**Price** 3 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

This hollow piece resembles a typical coin and features enough space inside to hide brief messages written on small pieces of paper. You can unscrew or close the coin with an Interact action. You can determine an unattended concealment coin's true nature with a successful `DC 20 Perception check` check. Determining the coin's nature while it's being handled is more difficult and typically requires a successful Perception check against the Thievery DC of the person holding the coin.
