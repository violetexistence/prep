Within hives of giant bees, some become protectors of their hive and etch runes onto their stingers via dance. Upon such a bee's death, its stinger can be removed from its body and used as _+1 striking rapier_, though a hilt often needs to be attached for skilled swordsmanship. The imbued magic allows the stinger to slowly renew a small bit of its venom supply. The wielder can gather this and deliver it during a Strike. The victim is made to see prophetic flashes of their future as it courses through their system.
