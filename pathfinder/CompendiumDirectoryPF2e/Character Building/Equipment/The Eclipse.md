# The Eclipse
## Item 20
### [unique](unique "Unique Rarity Trait")[[artifact]][[harrow-court]][[invested]][[magical]]


**Price** 0 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** carried

**Suit** Stars (Wis)

**Alignment** lawful evil

* * *

_The Eclipse_ represents self-doubt and loss of purpose, as well as a loss of faith. As long as _The Eclipse_ is invested, you gain a +2 item bonus on Religion checks. This increases to a +3 bonus if you are at least 17th level.

**Activate** `pf2:r` envision (mental)

**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** A foe that you're aware of and who is within 60 feet achieves a critical success on a saving throw or a Strike

* * *

**Effect** You produce an aura of doubt that overwhelms all foes in a 30-foot emanation and reduces bright light in that area to dim light, as if the region were under an eclipse. The triggering creature's critical success is reduced to a regular success. All further saving throws or Strikes attempted by enemies within the emanation suffer a –2 item penalty; saving throws or Strikes attempted by the triggering enemy suffer a –3 penalty instead. You can sustain this aura of doubt for up to 1 minute.
