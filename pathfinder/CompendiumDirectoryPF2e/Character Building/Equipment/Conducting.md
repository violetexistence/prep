# Conducting
## Item 7
### [[magical]]


**Price** 300 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** etched-onto-a-weapon

A conducting weapon can channel energy through it. The weapon gains the resonant weapon trait, except that when you [[Actions/Conduct Energy|Conduct Energy]], the weapon deals an additional 1d8 damage of the selected type instead of 1 additional damage per die; if the weapon already had the resonant weapon trait, it deals 1d8 damage plus 1 damage per die instead. On a critical hit, the weapon deals 1d8 persistent damage of the same type.
