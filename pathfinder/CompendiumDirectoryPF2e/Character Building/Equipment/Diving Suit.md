# Diving Suit
## Item 3
### 


**Price** 100 gp; 
**Bulk** 1; **Size** med
**Usage** wornclothing

Diving suits are bulky, waterproofed leather outfits with copper helmets, worn by divers and underwater salvagers. The suit grants a +1 item bonus to Swim checks made underwater, and the helmet features tubes for connecting _[[Equipment/Bottled Air|Bottled Air]]_. When connected to a diving suit, _bottled air_ doesn't need to be held and can be used to breathe as a free action. If you wear armor over a diving suit, you become [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] until you remove the diving suit.
