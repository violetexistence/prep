A _Pathfinder's mentor_ is a wayfinder that has developed sapience. It has two _aeon stone_ slots, and both stones grant their resonant powers without interfering with each other. If both slots are filled, the _wayfinder_ and two stones count as two items toward your investiture limit. Most Pathfinder's mentors are eager explorers that object to staying in one location for long, urging their bearers toward ancient ruins to explore, relics to study, and discoveries to make. To this end, the wayfinder acts as a guide, making Survival checks on your behalf during your travels. A _Pathfinder's mentor_ also has the following activations.

**Effect** The wayfinder casts [[Spells/Know the Way|Know the Way]] on you.

* * *

**Activate** 1 minute (concentrate, manipulate)

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** The wayfinder casts [[Spells/Wanderer's Guide|Wanderer's Guide]] on you.
