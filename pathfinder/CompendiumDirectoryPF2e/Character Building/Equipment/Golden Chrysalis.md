Threads of iridescent golden silk wrap around the core of this magical sling stone. When you activate and shoot a _golden chrysalis_, rather than making an attack roll for your Strike, you cause the chrysalis to unwind in midair to reveal a magical butterfly that flies in a 30-foot line, scattering golden scale dust that hangs in the air for 1 minute.

A creature that enters or begins its turn in the dust must attempt a `DC 19 Reflex check` or have its [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisiblity]] negated, becoming [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] instead of invisible. This effect applies both if the creature was already invisible and if it benefits from any new invisibility effects before the end of the invisibility negation effect from the golden chrysalis.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target's invisibility is negated for 2 rounds.

**Failure** The target is [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] for 1 minute and its invisibility is negated for 1 minute.
