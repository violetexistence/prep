Bitterblood elixir is a pale pink color, like that of water tinted by a few drops of blood. After you drink this elixir, your blood becomes dangerous for other creatures to consume. For the next hour, whenever a creature drinks your blood, the elixir changes your blood into a foul-tasting acid as it mixes with the drinker's saliva. You're unharmed by this transformation, but the blood drinker must attempt a `DC 20 Fortitude check` save.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature takes 2d6 acid damage and is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]].

**Failure** The creature takes 4d6 acid damage and is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]].

**Critical Failure** The creature takes 4d6 acid + 2d6 persistent acid damage, and is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 3]].
