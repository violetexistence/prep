# Masquerade Scarf (Greater)
## Item 7
### [[invested]][[magical]]


**Price** 340 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** worn

This delicately embroidered scarf matches with every outfit and can even complete a costume or disguise with illusions.

* * *

**Activateâ€”Masquerade** `pf2:2` (manipulate)

**Effect** You arrange the scarf over your lower face, and it casts a 2nd-rank [[Spells/Illusory Disguise|Illusory Disguise]] spell on you, which ends immediately if the scarf is removed. You can alter the scarf's appearance or make it invisible as part of the _illusory disguise_, but it can still be felt if touched.
