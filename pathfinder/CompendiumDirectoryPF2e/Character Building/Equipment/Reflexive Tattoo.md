# Reflexive Tattoo
## Item 7
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[invested]][[magical]][[tattoo]]


**Price** 350 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** tattooed-on-the-body

This subtle pattern of complex dots, sunbursts, and lines is difficult to make out, as it's a near match for the wearer's skin tone. Serving as a barrier facing inward, this tattoo prevents ostentatious expressions of spells that are internal to you, making them easier to hide.

* * *

**Activate** `pf2:1` Interact (concentrate, manipulate, spellshape)

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell of 2nd level or lower that affects or targets only you, you can hide that you're casting it. This has the same effect as the [[Feats/Conceal Spell|Conceal Spell]] feat.
