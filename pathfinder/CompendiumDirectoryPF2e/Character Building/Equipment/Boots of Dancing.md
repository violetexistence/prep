These boots act as [[Equipment/Boots of Elvenkind (Greater)|Boots of Elvenkind (Greater)]], but they react wildly to strong physical exertion. While you wear the boots, the curse activates whenever you attempt an Athletics check or Stride more than once in a single round during an encounter. The boots cast an 8th-rank [[Spells/Uncontrollable Dance|Uncontrollable Dance]] spell on you, and you automatically fail your save. Once the curse has activated for the first time, the boots fuse to you.
