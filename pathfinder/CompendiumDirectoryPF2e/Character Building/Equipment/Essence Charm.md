# Essence Charm
## Item 4
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[invested]][[magical]]


**Price** 100 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** worn

Anyone can use an _essence forge_ to craft an _essence charm_ without needing to know the formula for an _essence charm_. No larger than a coin, an _essence charm_ is normally worn around the neck or hung from a belt—its exact appearance is up to the crafter. When an _essence charm_ is created, its crafter selects a skill in which they are at least trained. The _essence charm_ grants a +1 item bonus to that skill when worn.

**Activate—Lucky Charm** `pf2:r` (concentrate)

**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** You fail or critically fail a check using the _essence charm_'s chosen skill

**Effect** A failed check becomes a success, and a critical failure becomes a failure.
