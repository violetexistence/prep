# Thousand-Pains Fulu (Burl)
## Item 17
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[consumable]][[fulu]][[magical]]

**Category** fulu; 
**Price** 2700 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** affixed-to-a-creature

**Duration** 1 minute

Created by a chirurgeon who threw away morality in search of endless life, a _thousand-pains fulu_ blocks the natural flow of elements in the body. A creature to which the fulu is affixed must attempt a `DC 35 Fortitude check`. Failure or critical failure primes the target for persistent damage triggered by a specific condition that must be met within the fulu's duration.

Though this green fulu looks inviting, it has a foreboding aura. The fulu deals 10d8 poison, causing the target's body to respond adversely to their qi. On a failure or critical failure, if the target takes fire damage, it takes 2d8 persistent poison as well. These effects have the poison trait.
