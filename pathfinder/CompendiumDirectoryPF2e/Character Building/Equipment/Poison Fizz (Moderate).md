* * *

Made from a special mixture of honey and alchemical reagents, poison fizz is a zesty, sweet rock candy that pops and crackles in your mouth. For 1 hour, you have a +2 item bonus to saving throws against poison and being petrified.

**Secondary Effect** `pf2:2` (poison)

**Effect** You bite the poison fizz to release its poisonous liquid center and spray green mist in a 15-foot cone. This deals 4d6 poison with a `DC 29 Reflex check`. A creature that critically fails is also [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] until the end of your next turn and is then temporarily immune to being blinded by poison fizz for 1 hour.
