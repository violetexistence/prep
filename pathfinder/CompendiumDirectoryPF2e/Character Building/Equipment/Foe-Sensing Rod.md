Imbued with a spirit fragment that continually surveys the world around it, this crystalline bar is roughened to form a file at one end. When you apply the _foe-sensing rod_ to a weapon, choose aberration, animal, beast, celestial, construct, dragon, elemental, fey, fiend, giant, monitor, ooze, undead, or both fungus and plant. The spirit fragment is transferred into your weapon for 1 hour, keeping watch for creatures with the chosen trait or traits. The affected weapon vibrates slightly if such a creature is within 60 feet of you, unless the creature is disguised or [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] and has a Deception or Stealth DC of 26 or higher.
