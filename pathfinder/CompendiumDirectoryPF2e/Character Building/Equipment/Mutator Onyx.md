A mutator onyx is a jet-black, alien mineral first found within the walls of the Onyx Citadel but is now used primarily as an alchemical teaching or experimentation tool within Oprak. Pressing the gem into a solid, unattended inanimate object with Hardness 5 or less transforms that object's surface into a curious syrupy, liquid-like state, reducing its Hardness to 0. One mutator onyx can transform up to a 5-foot cube. After 10 minutes, the matter reverts to its solid state, regaining its Hardness.
