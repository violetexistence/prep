# Scholarly Journal Compendium
## Item 3
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")


**Price** 30 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

Scholarly journals are uncommon. Each scholarly journal is a folio on a very specific topic, such as vampires or the history of a single town or neighborhood of a city. If you spend 1 minute referencing an academic journal before attempting a skill check to Recall Knowledge about the subject, you gain a +1 item bonus to the check. A compendium of journals costs five times as much as a single journal and requires both hands to use; each compendium contains several journals and grants its bonus on a broader topic, such as all undead or a whole city. The GM determines what scholarly journals are available in any location.
