When you invest the sash, you either increase your Intelligence score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever would give you a higher score.

**Effect** You focus on a creature you can see and attempt to gain an instinctual understanding of the creature. You attempt a check to [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] about the creature, rolling twice and taking the higher result. If you roll a critical failure on this check, you get a failure instead. Regardless of the result, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to attack rolls against the creature and to your AC and saving throws against attacks and effects from the creature for 1 minute. This bonus increases to +2 if you critically succeeded your check to Recall Knowledge.
