# Lambent Perfume
## Item 6
### [[censer]][[fire]][[magical]]


**Price** 250 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

This ceramic incense burner is shaped like a three-headed ibis in the form of Atreia, spreading his wings and preparing to take flight; it hangs on a thin, golden chain.

* * *

**Activateâ€”Light Incense** `pf2:2` (aura, manipulate)

**Frequency** once per day

**Cost** incense worth at least 1 sp

**Effect** Sparkling golden mist escapes the ibis's open beaks, spreading in a 20-foot emanation. This perfume mist is calming and restorative. A creature that ends its turn within the censer's smoke while sickened or under an affliction can attempt a new saving throw to overcome it.

A creature with multiple afflictions, or that is both sickened and has an affliction, chooses one to attempt to overcome each time it ends its turn in the aura. After attempting a new saving throw against an affliction, a creature is temporarily immune to _lambent perfume_ for the purpose of overcoming that affliction for 24 hours.
