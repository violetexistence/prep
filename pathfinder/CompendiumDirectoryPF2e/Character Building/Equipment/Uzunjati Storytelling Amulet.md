In Azimbye's case, their gold-rimmed metal amulet boasts fine dwarven workmanship, and bears lines from one of the oldest epic poems of the legendary folk hero Kgalaserke on one side and a stylized portrait of a storytelling event in Ranage's Circle on the other. While wearing the amulet, you gain a +1 item bonus to Performance checks.
