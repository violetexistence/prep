Watering grape or berry bushes with certain alchemical liquids as they grow results in a ruby-red drink that's rich and heady. The vines develop a connection to their natural environment and impart it onto the wine's imbiber. For 1 minute after drinking a glass of arbor wine, you have tremorsense at a range of 30 feet.
