This rare gadget uses Stasian technology to grant someone a burst of activity, though its use can be painful. The electromuscular stimulator must be carefully attached to you, requiring 1 minute to do so. You can attach an electromuscular stimulator to yourself. When you Activate an attached electromuscular stimulator, roll a `Crafting check` check, using the Crafting modifier of the creature who attached the stimulator to you, with a DC equal to the standard DC for your level. The effects of the activation depend on the result of the Crafting check.
