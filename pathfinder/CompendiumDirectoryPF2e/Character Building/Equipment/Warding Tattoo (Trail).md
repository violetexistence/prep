**Price** 250 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med

Many cultures of Golarion have a tattoo to turn away harm; as such, warding tattoos often resemble whichever dangers are most common to the culture, such as a wild beast or a whirlpool in the high seas of the Shackles.

You gain resistance 2 to damage from hazardous terrain and environmental hazards at all times.

**Activate** `pf2:r` envision

**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** An enemy, hazard, or the environment makes an attack against your AC, requires you to attempt a saving throw, or causes you to take damage automatically

**Effect** Until the end of the current turn, against the triggering effect, you gain a +1 status bonus to AC and saving throws and gain resistance 2 to damage. Your resistance to damage from hazardous terrain and environmental hazards becomes resistance 5.
