This _+1 striking frost katana_ is always cool to the touch, nearly uncomfortably so. Unadorned and with no tsuba, its honed blade is carved from a single tusk of dragon-turtle ivory and wrapped in strips of winter wolf hide. Strikes with the katana gain a +2 status bonus to damage rolls against creatures that have a status penalty to their Speed or are slowed. The status bonus increases to +3 if the weapon has a greater striking rune and +4 for major striking.

* * *

**Activate** `pf2:0` command (cold, evocation, magical)

* * *
