*   **Armor** You gain a +3 item bonus to saving throws against illusions and Deception checks to [[Actions/Create a Diversion|Create a Diversion]].
*   **Weapon** (visual) After you cast an illusion spell by activating the scarf, the weapon is shrouded in a mesmerizing illusory pattern. Your next Strike causes the target to be [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]] for 1 minute if it hits. If you don't make a Strike by the end of your next turn, the illusion ends with no effect.
