This brightly painted ceramic sphere contains chemicals that cause plants to wither and die. You gain a +1 item bonus to attack rolls. A defoliation bomb deals the 2d6 void damage, 2d4 persistent void damage, and 2 void splash damage to all plants in the area. Non-creature plants in the area immediately wither and die.
