# Ring of Maniacal Devices
## Item 11
### [[invested]][[magical]]


**Price** 1175 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** worn

This magic ring seems like simple tarnished brass, but it enhances your curiosity about traps and devices of all kinds.

You can use an Interact action to pull a [[Equipment/Thieves' Toolkit|Thieves' Toolkit]] from the ring. This toolkit appears in your hand and any part of it folds back into the ring if they would leave your possession.

They grant you a +2 item bonus to Thievery checks to [[Actions/Disable a Device|Disable a Device]] and to [[Actions/Pick a Lock|Pick a Lock]], and the ring's insights grant you the same bonus to Crafting checks to [[Actions/Craft|Craft]] and [[Actions/Repair|Repair]] snares and traps.

* * *

**Activateâ€”Fireball Trap** 10 minutes (manipulate)

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** You create the effects of a [[Spells/Rune Trap|Rune Trap]] trap ritual containing [[Spells/Fireball|Fireball]]. You can have only one trapped rune from a _ring of maniacal devices_ active at a time, even if you have multiple rings, and the rune disappears if you lose your investiture in the ring.
