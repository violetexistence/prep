This staff is made of a dense wood and strikes the ground with an imposing boom. At the top of the staff is a perfectly round obsidian sphere that, when stared at for too long, makes viewers feel as though they're heavier than before. When wielding this staff, you gain a +1 item bonus to saves against forced movement.
