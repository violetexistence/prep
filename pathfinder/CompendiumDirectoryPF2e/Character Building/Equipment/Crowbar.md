# Crowbar

### 


**Price** 5 sp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-two-hands

When Forcing Open an object that doesn't have an easy grip, a crowbar makes it easier to gain the necessary leverage. Without a crowbar, prying something open takes a -2 item penalty to the Athletics check to Force Open.
