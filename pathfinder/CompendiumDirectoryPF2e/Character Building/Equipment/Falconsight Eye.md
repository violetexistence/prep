# Falconsight Eye
## Item 6
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[magical]]


**Price** 200 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** worn

This prosthetic eye resembles that of a bird of prey. Along with the abilities of the [[Equipment/Magical Prosthetic Eye|Magical Prosthetic Eye]], it allows you to strike foes at greater range and with impressive accuracy.

**Activate** `pf2:1` (concentrate)

**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

**Effect** You become keenly aware of your foes, even those seemingly out of reach. For 1 minute, you can close your eyes as a free action to see through a ranged weapon you're wielding, which reduces the penalty for firing into your weapon's second range increment from â€“2 to 0. This effect doesn't negate the [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] condition.
