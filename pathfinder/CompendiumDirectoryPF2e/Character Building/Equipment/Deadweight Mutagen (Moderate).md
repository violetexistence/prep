### [[alchemical]][[consumable]][[elixir]][[mutagen]][[polymorph]]

**Category** mutagen; 
**Price** 12 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

**Activate** `pf2:1` (manipulate)

* * *

For 10 minutes your joints loosen and bones thicken, making your body incredibly weighty and difficult to maneuver around.

**Benefit** You gain a +2 item bonus to Athletics checks to [[Actions/Shove|Shove]] and [[Actions/Trip|Trip]], to your Fortitude and Reflex DCs against attempts to Shove or Trip you, and to saving throws against effects that attempt to force you to move or knock you [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]].

**Drawback** You gain the [[Conditions/Encumbered|Encumbered]] condition and can't remove it while under the effects of the mutagen.
