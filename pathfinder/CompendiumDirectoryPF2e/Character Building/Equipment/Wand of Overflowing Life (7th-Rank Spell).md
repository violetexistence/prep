# Wand of Overflowing Life (7th-Rank Spell)
## Item 17
### [[healing]][[magical]][[vitality]][[wand]]


**Price** 15000 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

This alabaster wand has a clear crystal at the tip.

* * *

**Activate** Cast a Spell

**Frequency** once per day, plus overcharge

**Effect** You cast [[Spells/Heal|Heal]] at 7th-rank.

After you cast the spell, at the start of your next turn, excess healing magic wells up from the wand and heals you, as though you cast the 1-action version of _heal_ on yourself at 7th-rank. You gain this benefit only once per turn, even if you cast multiple _heal_ spells from _wands of overflowing life_ in the same turn.

* * *

**Craft Requirements** Supply a casting of _heal_ at 7th-rank.
