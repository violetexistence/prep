Used by gunwitches who want a bit more power each day, a _pistol wand_ is a firearm that also contains an [[Spells/Enfeeble|Enfeeble]] spell that can be cast using the same rules as a wand. Many other variants exist with different 1st-rank spells. This _+1 flintlock pistol_ has a [[Equipment/Reinforced Stock|Reinforced Stock]] permanently attached to it, and the pistol's _potency rune_ (and any other runes) applies to Strikes with the stock as well.
