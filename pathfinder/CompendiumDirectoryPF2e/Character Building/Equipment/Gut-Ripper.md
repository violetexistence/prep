This _+1 striking ogre hook_ causes its owner to dream of past murders conducted with the weapon. _Gut-Ripper_'s mythic magic is tied to the bloodlust of the ogre boss who was holding it upon becoming mythic. If _Gut-Ripper_ doesn't kill a creature each day by midnight, it becomes a non-magical ogre hook.

**Activateâ€”Rip Guts! Rip Guts!** `pf2:2` **Cost** 1 Mythic Point

**Effect** You throw _Gut-Ripper_ in a line of any length up to 60 feet, then it returns to your hands. Each creature in the line takes 2d10 piercing damage with a `DC 25 Fortitude check` save. If there's a creature at the end of the line, you instead make a melee Strike against it with the hook that deals an additional 2d10 persistent bleed damage. Each time a creature takes this bleed damage, you regain that many HP; this is a healing vitality effect. This activation can't be used again for 1d4 rounds.
