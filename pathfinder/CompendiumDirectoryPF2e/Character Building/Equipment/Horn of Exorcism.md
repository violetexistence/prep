# Horn of Exorcism
## Item 11
### [[magical]]


**Price** 1250 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

A _horn of exorcism_ is an instrument made from an animal horn, or an object of the same shape from carved wood or ivory.

* * *

**Activate—Rattle the Dead** `pf2:1` (auditory, manipulate)

**Frequency** once per hour

**Effect** Blowing into the horn frightens ghosts and evil spirits who can hear its call. Make an Intimidation check to [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] against all creatures with the undead or unholy trait in a 30-foot emanation. This can affect even a mindless creature with that trait, and you don't take a penalty when you attempt to Demoralize a creature that doesn't understand your language.

* * *

**Activate—Sacred Seeds** `pf2:2` (manipulate)

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** You fill the horn with sacred seeds and then scatter them around you with a twist of your wrist. The horn grants you and your allies in a 30-foot emanation the _ghost touch_ property rune on all of your weapon and unarmed Strikes for 1 minute.
