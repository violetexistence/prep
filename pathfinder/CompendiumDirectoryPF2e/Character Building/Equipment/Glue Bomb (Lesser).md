A glue bomb is a harmless explosive mechanism bursting with sticky substances. When you hit a creature with a glue bomb, that creature takes a â€“10-foot status penalty to its Speeds for 1 minute. The [[Actions/Escape|Escape]] DC is [[Actions/escape dc=17|escape dc=17]]{17}.

On a critical hit, a creature in contact with a solid surface becomes stuck to the surface and [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] for 1 round, and a creature flying via wings has its wings tangled, causing it to fall safely to the ground and become unable to Fly again for 1 round. Glue bombs are not effective when used on a creature that is in water.

The target can end any effects by Escaping or spending a total of 3 Interact actions to carefully remove the sticky substances. These Interact actions don't have to be consecutive, and other creatures can provide the actions as well.
