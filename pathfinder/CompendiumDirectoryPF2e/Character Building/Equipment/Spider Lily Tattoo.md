# Spider Lily Tattoo
## Item 3
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[invested]][[magical]][[tattoo]]


**Price** 60 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** tattooed-on-the-body

The spider lily tattoo marks you as a trusted member of Granny Hu's network. This crimson tattoo fades and becomes [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]] within a day of being applied, reappearing only when you Activate it, when you gain the [[Conditions/Doomed|Doomed]] condition, or when you die. The higher the doomed value, the more vivid the color.

If your tattoo is plainly visible, you gain a +1 item bonus to Intimidation checks against all creatures that can see the tattoo, but you take a –1 item penalty to Diplomacy checks to [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] on those who understand the actual meaning of the spider lily tattoo (including all of Willowshore's citizens).

* * *

**Activate** `pf2:1` envision (concentrate)

**Requirements** Your tattoo isn't currently visible

**Effect** You make the tattoo visible. You can use this activation again to make the tattoo not visible, unless you have the doomed condition.

* * *

**Activate** `pf2:0` envision (concentrate)

**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** An undead creature detects you for the first time

**Effect** The spider lily tattoo manipulates your life force to make you appear to be undead for a short time. Attempt a `Deception check` check against the triggering undead creature's Perception DC. On a success, the triggering undead believes you're undead as well—a mindless undead is likely to ignore you, while a sapient undead might react with curiosity or confusion. You can continue attempting Deception checks each round as a single action to Sustain the effect for up to 1 minute.
