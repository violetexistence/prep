This spine and skull of a slain hydra has been picked clean by a carrion bird and crafted into this _+1 striking club_. In addition to its normal traits, the _hydra head club_ also has the modular P trait, as it can be manipulated to cause the jaws to spring open. Even in death, its head twitches independently. The creature's famed regenerative powers are still present, despite the creature's death; if damaged, the _hydra head club_ repairs itself at the rate of 1 Hit Point per minute, unless it has been completed destroyed.

**Activateâ€”Reactive Snap** `pf2:0` (attack)

**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** You attempt a Strike as a Reaction

* * *

**Effect** The _hydra head club_ snaps with a momentary burst of its former glory. Your Strike attempt deals an additional 1d6 damage. If your Strike misses, the activation does not count against the _hydra head club's_ activation frequency.
