# Burrowing Bolt (Greater)
## Item 14
### [[consumable]][[magical]]

**Category** ammo; 
**Price** 650 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

**Ammunition** arrow, bolt

**Activate** `pf2:1` (manipulate)

* * *

These arrows have tips grooved like a drill bit and angled fletching, causing them to spin quickly about their shaft when fired. When striking a structure or object of Hardness 18 or less within your first range increment, an activated burrowing bolt tunnels into the surface silently and leaves a hole behind it, burrowing through up to 10 feet of material before magically vanishing.
