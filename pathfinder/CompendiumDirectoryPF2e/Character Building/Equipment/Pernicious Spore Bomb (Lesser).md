This flask contains fast-growing mold spores, which quickly take root but just as quickly rot away. The bomb deals 1 poison damage, 1d4 persistent piercing damage, and 1 poison splash damage. Except on a critical failure, one square of the target creature's space is coated in vegetation, becoming difficult terrain for 1 round.
