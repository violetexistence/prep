This specialized [[Equipment/Grappling Gun|Grappling Gun]], which attaches to your wrist, connects to a spool of 50 feet of thin metal cord attached to a pack on your back. The wrist grappler and pack are small enough that they can be concealed with a loose jacket or similar piece of clothing. You can deploy or stow the gun from the attached wrist device with an Interact action. Reloading a wrist grappler uses the same process as reloading a standard grappling gun and takes 1 minute.
