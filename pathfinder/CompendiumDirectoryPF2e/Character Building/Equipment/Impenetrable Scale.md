# Impenetrable Scale
## Item 17
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[invested]][[magical]]

**Category** medium; **Group** composite
**Price** 12800 gp; 
**Bulk** 3; **Size** med
**Usage** wornarmor

Made of overlapping, lustrous black scales of standard-grade adamantine, this +2 _greater resilient [[Equipment/Fortification|Fortification]] adamantine scale mail_ seems to momentarily thicken at the point of impact when hit.

Whenever the armor's _fortification_ rune successfully turns a significant foe's critical hit into a normal hit, one of the scales on the armor turns violet. You gain resistance to physical damage equal to the number of violet scales, to a maximum of 8.

At dawn each day, all the violet scales return to normal.

**Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials must include 1,600 gp of adamantine.
