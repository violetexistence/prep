# Timepiece (Grand Clock)
## Item 3
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[clockwork]]


**Price** 50 gp; 
**Bulk** 16; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

Clockwork timepieces come in a variety of sizes and aesthetic styles, but they're all designed to display the accurate time of day down to the second.

Clockwork timepieces have a 24-hour activation cycle, after which they must wound in a process that takes 1 minute to complete.

These towering, ten-foot-tall clocks have been painstakingly handcrafted by skilled artisans and feature loud chimes that can be heard hourly throughout a manor. Owners of grand clocks usually tend to display them prominently in a study, lounge area, or foyer.
