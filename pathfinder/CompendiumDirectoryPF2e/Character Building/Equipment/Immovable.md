# Immovable
## Item 12
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[magical]]


**Price** 1800 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** etched-onto-armor

This rune utilizes magical principles to manipulate gravity and turn you into an immovable object.

**Activate**`pf2:1` (manipulate)

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** Your armor anchors you in place, even defying gravity, rendering you [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] until you Dismiss the Activation. While you're immobilized in this way, you can be moved only if a creature succeeds at a `DC 40 Athletics check` check to [[Actions/Force Open|Force Open]] your armor. You can also be moved if 8,000 pounds of pressure are placed upon you, though this is likely fatal.
