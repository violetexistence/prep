A set of _leeching fangs_ is a metal sculpture in the form of a fanged maw, and when applied to a weapon, it causes the weapon or its ammunition to grow numerous mouths filled with serrated teeth. _Leeching fangs_ establish a metaphysical link between the life force of the wielder of the weapon it's applied to and those it damages. Whenever you deal Hit Point damage to a living creature with a weapon under the effect of _leeching fangs_, you heal yourself half the amount of Hit Point damage dealt. This cannot heal you above your maximum number of Hit Points.
