**Activateâ€”Lightning Rod** `pf2:r`

**Trigger** You take electricity damage

**Effect** You gain resistance 5 to the triggering damage, and the _fulmination fang_ crackles with the absorbed energy. You can Interact to change between the gun sword's current usage (melee to ranged, or ranged to melee). The next melee Strike you make with the _fulmination fang_ within the next minute deals an additional 1d6 electricity damage. After a minute, the absorbed energy dissipates.
