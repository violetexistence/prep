# Animal Call

###

**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

Animal calls are often whistles or similar devices that imitate the calls of animals. Each call is for a specific type of animal, such as a duck or bear. When you use the call, it gives you a +1 item bonus to [[Actions/Command an Animal|Command an Animal]], provided the animal is of the type as the call. You also do not take a circumstance penalty when attempting to [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] that animal for not sharing a language.
