The stoic echo of Candlaron the Sculptor, architect of the aiudara network, infuses the _Guiding Star Orb_. As long as you have him invested, the _Guiding Star Orb_ orbits your body instead of needing to be held in one hand. You can stow the _Guiding Star Orb_ with an Interact action, and he can be snatched out of the air with a successful [[Actions/Disarm|Disarm]] action against you. When stowed, the _Guiding Star Orb_ remains invested, but if he's removed from you via Disarm, your investment ends if you don't reclaim him by the end of your next turn. The _Guiding Star Orb's_ voice is scholarly and precise, speaking telepathically with clearly enunciated but often complex words, and he assumes you're educated enough to keep up with his academic dialogue.

As long as you have the _Guiding Star Orb_ invested, teleportation effects created by you or the _Guiding Star Orb_ aren't affected by the Witchbole's meddling with teleportation effects, and they can't be counteracted by the Witchbole.

**Activate—Blinding Spark** `pf2:2` (concentrate, incapacitation, light, visual)

**Effect** The _Guiding Star Orb_ creates a beam of bright light and fires it at a creature within 30 feet. That creature must attempt a `DC 43 Fortitude check` save, after which that creature is temporarily immune to Blinding Spark for 24 hours.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target is [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] for 1 round.

**Failure** The target is [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] for 1 round.

**Critical Failure** The target is permanently blinded.

**Activate—Embed Location** `pf2:2` (concentrate)

**Effect** By focusing, the _Guiding Star Orb_ embeds your current location within. Thereafter, anyone who touches the _Guiding Star Orb_ while casting a spell with the teleportation trait to travel to this location arrives precisely, without any inaccuracy at all. The _Guiding Star Orb_ can have up to three locations embedded at a time; if this activity is used a fourth time, the new location replaces the oldest stored one.

* * *

**Activate—Momentary Aiudara** 10 minutes (concentrate)

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** A shimmering magical archway appears next to you as the _Guiding Star Orb_ casts a 9th-rank [[Spells/Teleport|Teleport]] to your specifications. If you're teleporting to an aiudara you've visited before, you and the targets appear precisely at that location. If you're teleporting to Lotusgate in Kyonin, this effect functions as [[Spells/Interplanar Teleport|Interplanar Teleport]] if you aren't on the same plane as Kyonin.
