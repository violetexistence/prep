# Hungry Lantern
## Item 12
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[magical]]


**Price** 1900 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

This lantern is made of weathered tin and is cold and moist to the touch. The interior of the lantern, where a wick or candle would normally be placed, is filled with thick, black smoke, and there's no way to open the lantern.

* * *

**Activateâ€”Consuming Darkness** `pf2:3` (concentrate, darkness, death, manipulate, spirit)

**Frequency** once per week

**Effect** Pure, impenetrable darkness flows out of the lantern like smoke and simply eats the light. A 60-foot emanation centered on the lantern is plunged into darkness for 1 minute. This darkness functions as a 4th-rank [[Spells/Darkness|Darkness]] spell. When the darkness is created, it deals 6d8 spirit damage (`DC 30 Fortitude check` save) to all creatures within the area. Any creature reduced to 0 Hit Points from this damage is destroyed entirely, leaving behind only a shadow that will slowly fade over the course of a year.
