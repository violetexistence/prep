This staff of magically hardened wood is topped with a silver sculpture depicting magical runic symbols. When used as a weapon, a _staff of power_ is a _+2 greater striking staff_.

Voluntarily destroying a _staff of power_ unleashes an incredible blast of energy. When wielding the staff, you can Interact to break it. This releases a 30-foot burst magical explosion centered on the staff. This deals 2d8 force damage per charge remaining in the staff (`DC 40 Reflex check`). You automatically critically fail your save. A creature reduced to 0 Hit Points by this damage dies instantly; this is a death effect.
