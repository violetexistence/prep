**Effect** You touch the collar and your companion splits into a swarm of hundreds of identical Tiny versions of itself for 1 minute. Its space becomes Large, it gains the weaknesses and resistances of a [[Monster Core/Spider Swarm|Spider Swarm]], and the swarm trait, though it doesn't gain swarm mind, as it's controlled by a single mind. Its unarmed attacks are replaced with a single-action swarming attack that deals 1d8 damage of the type normally inflicted by the companion's unarmed attacks to any foe in its space, with a `DC 23 Reflex check` save. While in swarm form, your companion can take the Support action but can't perform its advanced maneuver. Its other statistics don't change. If the companion is reduced to 0 Hit Points while in swarm form, the companion immediately recombines into its original form in an available space, in addition to the usual effects of being reduced to 0 Hit Points.
