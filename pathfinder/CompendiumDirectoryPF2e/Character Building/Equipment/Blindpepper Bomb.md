Though expensive, these single-use alchemical bombs are often used by police forces to disperse unruly crowds and quell riots without risking permanent physical injury to either officers or civilians.

The bomb can be thrown up to 30 feet, causing it to explode, spraying the aerosolized pepper dust in a 15-foot-radius burst. All creatures in the area must succeed at a `DC 18 Reflex check` save to avoid inhaling the dust or getting it in their eyes.

On a failed save, the creature is [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] for 1 round and then [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] for 1 round.

On a critical failure, the creature is blinded for 1 round, [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]], and dazzled until it removes the sickened condition.
