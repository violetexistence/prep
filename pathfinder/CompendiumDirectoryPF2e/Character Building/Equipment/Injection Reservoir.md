# Injection Reservoir
## Item 1
### [[adjustment]][[alchemical]]


**Price** 10 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** applied-to-a-non-injection-melee-weapon-piercing-damage

This reservoir and spring-loaded needle can be attached to a weapon to let it inject deadly poisons. Additionally, the reservoir can be filled with an injury poison. Immediately after a successful attack with the adjusted weapon, you can inject the target with the loaded poison by activating the reservoir with an Interact action. Refilling the reservoir with a new poison requires 3 Interact actions and uses both hands.

Adding an injection reservoir to a weapon throws off its balance, causing the multiple attack penalty with the weapon to be one greater than usual (usually –6 on a second attack and –11 on a third; or –5 and –10 with an agile weapon).
