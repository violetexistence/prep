The pommel of this _+4 major striking disruptive ghost touch high-grade silver dagger_ is a black glass orb that contains a tiny blue comet that spirals through the orb's interior. Strikes with the dagger deal an additional 1d8 vitality damage to worshippers of Urgathoa and to anyone who has ever created or summoned an undead creature. While the dagger is in your possession, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to Medicine checks and to Midwifery Lore checks. If you're a worshipper of Pharasma, you gain imprecise lifesense with a range of 60 feet while holding the dagger. If you're undead or a worshipper of Urgathoa, you're [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 4]] while holding the dagger.

Despite its utility in combat, the _Spiral Athame_ is intended as a ritual implement, meant to bless newborns and protect them from the predations of undead. If you use the _Spiral Athame_ to cut the umbilical cord of a newly born creature, that creature gains resistance to void damage equal to their level (minimum 1) and gains a +2 status bonus to saving throws against death effects and necromancy. These bonuses are permanent. Additionally, that creature can never become an undead creature.

**Activate** `pf2:2` command, Interact (divine, necromancy)

**Effect** You point the _Spiral Athame_ at a corpse within 30 feet, shielding it from corruption. The _Spiral Athame_ casts 5th-rank [[Spells/Peaceful Rest|Peaceful Rest]] on the corpse.

**Activate** `pf2:2` command, interact (divine, necromancy)

* * *

**Effect** You point the _Spiral Athame_ to the sky and pray, warding creatures against undead. This has the effect of 3rd-rank [[Spells/Circle of Protection|Circle of Protection]], except it wards against undead creatures rather than creatures of a specified alignment, and the emanation is centered on the _Spiral Athame_.

**Destruction** If an undead creature uses the _Spiral Athame_ to slay a psychopomp usher while within the Boneyard, the _Spiral Athame_'s pommel shatters and the _Spiral Athame_ becomes a mundane, high-grade silver dagger with no special abilities.
