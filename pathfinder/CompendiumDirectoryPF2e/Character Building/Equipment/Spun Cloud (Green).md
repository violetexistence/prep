On the Elemental Plane of Air, small clouds of differing colors can sometimes float separately from other cloud formations. Clever people can spin these clouds into small handfuls, creating a magical bundle of elemental power. Unlike most bottled breath, _spun clouds_ don't have any effect on you while you hold them in your lungs, but you can exhale the cloud as a single action. When exhaled, the cloud flows out and expands into a 20-foot burst within 60 feet of you. The cloud dissipates after 1 minute.

A green cloud smells terrible, making those inside ill. Any creature that ends its turn in the cloud must succeed at a `DC 25 Fortitude check` save or be [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] (or [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]] on a critical failure). Regardless of the result of its save, the creature becomes temporarily immune for 24 hours. This is an olfactory poison effect.
