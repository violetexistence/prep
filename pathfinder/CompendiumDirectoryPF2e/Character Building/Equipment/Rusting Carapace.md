This _+1 leather lamellar armor_ incorporates the plates of an ore louse's hide, woven together with the creature's own sinew into a functional set of armor. While wearing the rusting carapace, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC and saving throws against any effect that would rust you or your items, such as the ore louse's Strikes that have the rust ability or the [[Spells/Rust Cloud|Rust Cloud]] spell.

**Effect** Oxidizing liquid seeps from between the segments of the rusting hide onto a nearby metal creature, non-magical metal hazard, or non-magical metal item of up to 1 Bulk. A targeted creature or hazard gets a `DC 24 Fortitude check` save; a targeted item automatically gets a critical failure if unattended, but a creature holding or wearing it can attempt a `DC 24 Reflex check` save. The rust deals 8d6 untyped damage to a creature or hazard, plus 2d6 persistent damage on a failed save; it deals 2d6 untyped damage to an item, plus 1d6 persistent damage on a failed save.
