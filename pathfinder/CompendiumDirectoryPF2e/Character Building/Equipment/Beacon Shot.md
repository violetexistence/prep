## Item 3
### [[consumable]][[magical]]

**Category** ammo;

* * *

The shaft of a _beacon shot_ is studded with tiny flecks of glimmering gemstones. When an activated _beacon shot_ hits a target, it embeds itself into that target and spews sparks for 1 minute. If the target is [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]], it becomes merely [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] to creatures who would otherwise be unable to see it. The sparks also negate the [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] condition if the target was otherwise concealed.

A creature can remove the arrow or bolt by using an Interact basic action and succeeding at a `DC 20 Athletics check` check.
