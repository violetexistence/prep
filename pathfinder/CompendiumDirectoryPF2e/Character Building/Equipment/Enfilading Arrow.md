* * *

This arrow splits at the far end of the shaft into five branching arrowheads, making it impractical for single targets but deadly in combat. When you fire an activated _enfilading arrow_, it sails upward and shatters into countless copies. The arrows then rain down in a 10-foot burst at any point within your weapon's first range increment, dealing 6d8 piercing damage to all creatures in the area (`DC 25 Reflex check`).

If a creature critically fails the save and you have access to the bow critical specialization effect, the target is [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] and must spend an Interact action to attempt a `DC 10 Athletics check` check to pull the missile free; it can't move from its space until it succeeds.
