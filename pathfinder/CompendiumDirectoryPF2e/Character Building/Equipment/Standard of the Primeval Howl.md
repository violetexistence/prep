# Standard of the Primeval Howl
## Item 10
### [[magical]][[mental]]


**Price** 900 gp; 
**Bulk** 1; **Size** med

These standards are always constructed from uncut wood and a leather banner painted with the visage of a snarling beastâ€”a wolf, boar, bear, lion, dragon, or similarly imposing creature. And while it might become lost on a battlefield scattered with gaudier standards, its effect bolsters those around a competent leader. When carrying this banner, you gain a +1 item bonus to Intimidation checks and initiative rolls, and creatures in a 20-foot emanation also gain a +1 item bonus to initiative checks.

**Activate** `pf2:r` (concentrate)

**Frequency** once per hour

**Trigger** An ally within 20 feet of you critically hits with a Strike

**Requirements** You have the [[Feats/Battle Cry|Battle Cry]] skill feat

* * *

**Effect** You attempt to [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] the foe the Strike hit.
