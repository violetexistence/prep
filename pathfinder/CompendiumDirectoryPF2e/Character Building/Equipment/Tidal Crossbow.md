The beak and talons of a tidehawk form the triggering mechanism of this _+2 greater striking crossbow_. Its grip is constantly damp, though this doesn't affect your ability to keep ahold of the weapon. When used in aquatic combat, a _tidal crossbow_ doesn't have its range increments halved. A _tidal crossbow_ deals 1d4 additional bludgeoning damage on a successful Strike. On a critical hit, the bow's additional damage is instead 1d4 bludgeoning splash damage, and the target must succeed at a `DC 31 Reflex check` save or be pushed back 5 feet. The bow critical specialization effect applies to creatures with the water trait even if it wouldn't normally.

**Activateâ€”Typhoon Swell** `pf2:2` (manipulate, water)

**Effect** The _tidal crossbow_ produces a torrent of water in a 30-foot line, dealing 8d6 bludgeoning damage (`DC 30 Fortitude check` save). Creatures that fail the save are also knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]].

**Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials must include the beak, talons, and several watery feathers of a tidehawk.
