# Artisan's Toolkit

### 


**Price** 4 gp; 
**Bulk** 2; **Size** med
**Usage** other

You need these tools to create items from raw materials with the Craft skill. Different sets are needed for different work, as determined by the GM; for example, a blacksmith's toolkit differs from a woodworker's toolkit. If you wear your artisan's toolkit, you can draw and replace it as part of the action that uses it.
