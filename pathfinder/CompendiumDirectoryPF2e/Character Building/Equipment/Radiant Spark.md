## Item 25
### [unique](unique "Unique Rarity Trait")[[artifact]][[occult]]


**Price** 0 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

This shining prism is bound within a golden frame. The bright glow within the artifact is the gleaming essence of celestials bound within it in ancient times. Each activation consumes a bit of this celestial energy, projecting the screams of the celestials into your mind.

While holding the Radiant Spark, you gain a +2 item bonus to saving throws against divine spells and effects and you are aware of its powers.

If you are good, while holding the Radiant Spark, you are [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 3]] and can't recover from this condition.

**Activate** `pf2:2` envision, Interact

* * *

**Effect** The Radiant Spark casts a 10th-rank [[Spells/Dominate|Dominate]] spell (`DC 49 Will check`) on a creature that isn't from the Material Plane. Celestials get an outcome one degree of success worse than the result of their save.

* * *

**Activate** `pf2:0` envision

**Trigger** You begin casting a [[Spells/Binding Circle|Binding Circle]] ritual

* * *

**Effect** The Radiant Spark reduces the casting time of the ritual to 1 hour, and you don't need secondary casters for this ritual.

* * *

**Activate** `pf2:r` envision, Interact

**Trigger** The target critically fails their save against the Radiant Spark's dominate spell or you critically succeed at binding the target with the planar binding ritual using the artifact

* * *

**Effect** The target must attempt a `DC 49 Will check` save and is immune to further attempts for 24 hours.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target is [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 2]].

**Failure** The target dies and its essence is trapped within the Radiant Spark. It can be brought back to life only with powerful magic such as [[Spells/Wish|Wish]] or [[Spells/Miracle|Miracle]].

**Critical Failure** As failure, and the target can't be brought back to life until the Radiant Spark is destroyed.

* * *

**Destruction** An archfiend or evil demigod must willingly swap their essence with that of a celestial dominated or bound by the artifact, then critically fail the saving throw against having their essence consumed. This permanently destroys both the artifact and the fiend or demigod.
