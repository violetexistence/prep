Folklore from near the Forest of Spirits tells of the origin of the _poracha fulu_. Once, a traveler saved an eight-legged feline who turned out to be a poracha prince. In return, the prince gave the traveler a fulu that later prevented a fast-acting poison from slaying them. Traditionally, one wears a string of up to nine _poracha fulus_, which counts as one talisman. Each time you take persistent damage, one _poracha fulu_ affixed to you negates the damage and crumbles to dust. This response is automatic, but you can use a free action (envision) to prevent your fulus from responding. If you do, any _poracha fulus_ affixed to you never respond to that persistent damage.
