**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** When you are considering a course of action, you get a gut feeling about whether it's a good idea. You gain the effects of an [[Spells/Augury|Augury]] spell, except that you receive the result from your own instincts rather than an external source.

**Activate—Reclaim Your Mind** `pf2:r` (concentrate, fortune)

**Frequency** once per hour
