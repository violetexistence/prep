This heavy, 12-foot-tall _+2 striking Composite Longbow_ is fashioned from mammoth tusks lashed together. Due to its great size, you can attack with the Mammoth Bow only if you're Large or larger. The Mammoth Bow deals 2d6 additional piercing damage because of its incredible, magically enhanced draw power. Additionally, the Mammoth Bow has a 180-foot range increment instead of a 100-foot range increment, but its volley range increases from 30 feet to 50 feet.
