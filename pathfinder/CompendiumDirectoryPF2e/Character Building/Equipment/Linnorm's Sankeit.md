The first suit of _+3 greater resilient antimagic sankeit_ made in this fashion was crafted for the Varki linnorm king Nankou, after he claimed his title by slaying a taiga linnorm. By Varki tradition, the armor was crafted using some of the slain linnorm's body to decorate the breastplate and helm, which imbued the armor with several of the linnorm's natural abilities. Though the helm is shaped like the beast's head, a linnorm's actual head would be too large for a proper helmet.

**Activate** `pf2:2` (manipulate)

**Frequency** once per hour

**Effect** You breathe a 60-foot cone of electrified vapor, dealing 17d6 electricity to creatures in the area (`DC 38 Reflex check`). The electrified mist persists in the area for 2 rounds, dealing 5d6 electricity (DC 38 basic Reflex save) to each creature that ends its turn in the mist. If you slew the linnorm this armor is made from, you can use the higher of your class DC or spell DC instead of the listed DCs for this effect.
