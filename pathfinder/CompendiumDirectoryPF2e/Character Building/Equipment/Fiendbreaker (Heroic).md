The stately echo of Jininsiel, the woman who guided her people through the Darklands to escape the devastation of Earthfall, causes _Fiendbreaker_ to softly shimmer with a silvery radiance equivalent to that of candlelight. _Fiendbreaker_ can activate or deactivate this radiance as a free action once per round on her partner's turn. _Fiendbreaker's_ telepathic voice is calm and soothing, seeking to support her partner's decisions with compliments or warnings against overconfidence as needed.

_Fiendbreaker_ functions as a _+3 major striking holy high-grade cold iron staff_. While wielding the staff, you gain a +3 circumstance bonus to checks to [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] about any sort of fiend.

**Activate** Cast a Spell
