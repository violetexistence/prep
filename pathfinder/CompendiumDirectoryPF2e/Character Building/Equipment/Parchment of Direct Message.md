# Parchment of Direct Message
## Item 3
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[magical]]


**Price** 50 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

These two sheets resemble ordinary parchment, save for a simple seal burned into the corner. The two sheets are magically linked, though if either of the sheets is burnt, cut in half or smaller, or otherwise destroyed, then the other sheet becomes an ordinary piece of parchment. When you write a message on one of the sheets, the text disappears over the span of 1 minute, leaving no ink, imprint, or any other trace of inscription behind. The message then appears on the linked piece of parchment. The magical link between the sheets only functions while both sheets are within 10 miles of each other. Outside of this range, any writing remains on the sheets as if they were mundane sheets of parchment, though this writing becomes erased if the parchment is activated.

**Activate** `pf2:1` command

* * *

**Effect** You utter a specific magical phrase while holding one of the sheets of parchment. All writing disappears from the parchment.
