This luminescent white gem glows from within, and a weapon it's applied to gains its inner radiance, shedding dim light in a 10-foot radius. Successful Strikes with a weapon affected by a _limning gem_ outline the target in a bright white light; if the target was [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]], it becomes [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] instead. This light lasts until the end of your next turn or for the remainder of the _limning gem_'s duration on a critical hit.
