## Item 2
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")


**Price** 25 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

This timepiece is a marvel of clockwork and miniaturization; its gears, arbor, and mainspring are immaculately crafted and tuned to maximize precision and reduce time loss. This pocket watch has the properties of a clockwork dial, except it has a maximum duration of 24 hours and is available to characters from Alkenstar.
