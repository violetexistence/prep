# Fire Box
## Item 3

Anyone who opens the box triggers a clockwork mechanism that unleashes a 15-foot cone of fire. The cone issues forth in a random direction determined by the GM but always including the creature who opened the box. Those within the cone take 4d6 fire damage with a `DC 17 Reflex check` save.
