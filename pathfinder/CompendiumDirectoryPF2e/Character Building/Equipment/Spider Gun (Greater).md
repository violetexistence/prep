A _greater spider gun_ is a _+1 striking weapon_. It's a distinct type of martial firearm made from the fangs and spinneret of a Large spider. It deals 1d10 poison damage with a range increment of 30 feet and reload 1. On a critical hit, the venom clings to the target and they take persistent poison damage equal to 1d4+@item.system. persistent poison. A spider gun does not add critical specialization effects. The gun can be activated to fire webbing that hampers other creatures.

**Activateâ€”Web Shot** `pf2:1` (manipulate)

**Frequency** once per round

**Effect** You fire a mass of webbing at a square within 30 feet. That square becomes covered in webbing for 1 minute. A square covered with the webbing from a spider gun can be cleared by a single attack or effect that deals at least 15 slashing damage or 5 fire damage. A square has AC 5, and it automatically fails its saving throws. The first time each turn a creature in the webbing begins to use a move action or enters the webbing during a move action, it must attempt an Athletics check or Reflex save against DC 25. On a success, it moves normally through the webbing and clears away the webbing from any squares it enters this turn. On a failure, it treats squares of webbing as difficult terrain this turn, and on a critical failure, it's [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] for 1 round or until it Escapes ([[Actions/escape dc=25|escape dc=25]]{DC 25}) or destroys the webbing.

**Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials for the spider gun must include the fangs and spinneret of a giant spider or other Large spider.
