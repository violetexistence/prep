The blade of this _+2 greater striking holy standard-grade cold iron elven curve blade_ shines with a pale fire that illuminates the wielder's face in a grim visage and produces dim light in a 10-foot emanation. The wielder can suppress or reactivate this light as a single action with the concentrate trait.

**Activateâ€”Reveal Demons** `pf2:1` (concentrate, manipulate)

**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

**Effect** You brandish _Morning Glow_ and focus on its gleaming light, boosting its illumination so that it produces bright light in a 30-foot emanation (and dim light for another 30 feet) for 10 minutes. All creatures in this area that have the demon trait must attempt a `DC 31 Reflex check` save.

[[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Morning Glow|Effect: Morning Glow]]

**Success** The demon is unaffected by the glow.

**Failure** The demon becomes outlined with a shimmering aura of dim light that causes it to become [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]]. If the demon was [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]], it becomes [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] instead. If it was already concealed for any other reason, it is no longer concealed. This light affects the demon for 1 minute.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but with a duration of 10 minutes.
