Lady's blessing oil is favored by Pharasmin healers who ease the transitions of life. You can Activate the item as part of the same activity you use to Administer First Aid to stabilize a creature. If you use lady's blessing oil, the DC of the check to Administer First Aid is reduced to the creature's recovery roll DC, rather than 5 + the recovery roll DC. However, if you roll a failure on the check, you get a critical failure instead.
