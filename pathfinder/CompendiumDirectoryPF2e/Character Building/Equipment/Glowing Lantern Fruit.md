**Activate - Lantern Light** `pf2:1` (manipulate)

**Effect** The _glowing lantern fruit_ sheds bright light in a 60-foot radius (and dim light for the next 60 feet) for 8 hours. While the light is shining, you can Interact with the _glowing lantern fruit_ to open or close some of its reflective leaves, making the light directional like a bull's-eye lantern or a hooded lantern.

**Activate - Fire Fruit** 10 minutes (manipulate)

**Effect** You plant the _glowing lantern fruit_ in the ground upside down. The petals of the lantern peel away, while the fruit inside glows hotter. For the next 8 hours, the _glowing lantern fruit_ emits as much light and heat as a bonfire, giving all creatures within 15 feet immunity to the effects of mild and severe cold temperatures for as long as they're within the area.
