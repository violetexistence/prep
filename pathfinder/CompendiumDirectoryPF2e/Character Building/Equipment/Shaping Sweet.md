Many inhabitants of the First World can shape their environment around them; weaker creatures can only make minor changes, while powerful entities such as the Eldest can remake entire landscapes. A _shaping sweet_ is a gelatinous, fruit-flavored candy that confers a whisper of this ability on you when you eat it. For 1 hour after eating a _shaping sweet_, you can make each of the following changes to your surroundings with an Interact action. You can make each change only once.

*   **Alter Weather** You create or eliminate minor precipitation in a 30-foot emanation.
*   **Fairy Ring** A ring of flowers and mushrooms appears in a 10-foot burst around you, restoring 1 Hit Point at the start of each of your turns to a randomly chosen fey creature within. The ring lasts for 1 minute.
*   **Foliate Vegetation** grows around you in a 10-foot radius burst, creating light undergrowth that lasts for 1 minute.
*   **Terrain Shift** The ground in your space rises or falls by 5 feet, remaining at that height for 1 minute.
