Filled with sharp silver filings and alchemical reagents, this glass sphere leaves behind a cloud of dangerous shards. A creature hit with the orb takes 1 slashing damage and is covered with silver filings, making weapons and unarmed attacks damaging them be treated as silver until they spend an Interact action to clean off.

Except on a critical miss, the filings linger airborne in a 5-foot burst around the target. The cloud lasts for 1 minute or until dispersed by a strong wind. Creatures inside the cloud are [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] to those outside. Each breathing creature who ends its turn in the cloud takes 5d6 slashing damage from a silver source, with a `DC 39 Fortitude check` save.
