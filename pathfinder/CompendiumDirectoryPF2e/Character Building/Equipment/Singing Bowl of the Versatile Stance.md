**Price** 1175 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

In true Iroran form, the simplicity of this small, inverted copper bell belies its flawlessness. When struck with a mallet (included with the singing bowl), it emits a harmonious tone that inspires bodily perfection in those who know how to hear it.

**Activate** `pf2:1` Interact (auditory)

**Effect** While holding the _singing bowl of the versatile stance_ with one hand, you strike the lip of it with a mallet held in the other. Anyone within 60 feet currently in a stance can spend a reaction to use one of their stance actions in order to change to a different stance.
