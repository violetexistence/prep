This weapon is a long _+1 striking [[Equipment/Lance|Lance]]_ with a muzzle built into the pointed tip, allowing the user to fire the chamber after a successful melee attack. A barrel running down the length of the lance allows you to load firearm ammunition into the base of the weapon more easily than it might seem from the design. It takes 2 actions to reload a _blast lance_.

* * *

**Activate** `pf2:0` command

**Trigger** You strike a foe with the _blast lance_

**Requirements** The _blast lance_ is loaded with a round

**Effect** You fire a blast of gunpowder through the weapon that deals 3d8 fire damage. The foe must attempt a `DC 24 Fortitude check` save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected by the blast of gunpowder and the _blast lance_ misfires and jams.

**Success** The target takes half the fire damage.

**Failure** The target takes the full fire damage and is pushed back 5 feet. You can Stride after it, but you must move the same distance and in the same direction.

**Critical Failure** The target takes double damage and is pushed back 10 feet. You can Stride after it, but you must move the same distance and in the same direction.
