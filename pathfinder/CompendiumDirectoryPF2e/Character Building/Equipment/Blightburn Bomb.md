Blightburn bombs have radioactive materials sealed inside flasks treated with lead. The bomb grants a +2 item bonus to attack rolls and deals 3d6 poison damage, 3d4 persistent poison damage, and 3 poison splash damage. A creature that takes the persistent poison damage deals the splash damage again from its current position as the radiation continues to harm nearby creatures. The persistent damage can last up to 1 minute. Blightburn bombs also expose the primary target to blightburn sickness.
