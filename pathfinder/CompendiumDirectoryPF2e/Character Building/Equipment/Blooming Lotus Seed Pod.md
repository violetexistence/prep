**Category** other; 
**Price** 68 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

The seeds of this lotus seed pod scatter with incredible ease and accuracy, quickly growing into temporary plants.

* * *

**Activate - Floating Pads** `pf2:1` (manipulate)

**Effect** You scatter the blooming lotus seed pod's seeds across a non-damaging liquid surface within 40 feet of you, where they form into 5 lotus pads that each float in place in a separate square within range for 1 minute. Each lotus pad has a 10- foot radius and can support 1 Large creature, 2 Medium creatures, or 4 Small creatures.

* * *

**Activate - Blooming Flower** 10 minutes (manipulate)

**Effect** You plant the blooming lotus seed pod in the ground and a giant lotus flower blooms in that square. Over the next 8 hours, creatures who sleep for at least 6 hours within 30 feet of the lotus flower gain the benefits of long-term rest as though they'd spent an entire day and night resting, and all creatures within the affected area are immune to the effects of the [[Spells/Nightmare|Nightmare]] spell and other magical effects that affect only sleeping creatures.
