# Cognitive Mutagen (Moderate)
## Item 3
### [[alchemical]][[consumable]][[elixir]][[mutagen]][[polymorph]]

**Category** mutagen; 
**Price** 12 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

**Activate** `pf2:1` (manipulate)

* * *

Your mind becomes clear, but physical matters seem ephemeral.

**Benefit** You gain a +2 item bonus to Arcana, Crafting, Lore, Occultism, and Society checks and all checks to [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]]. Your critical failures on Recall Knowledge checks become failures instead.

**Drawback** You take a -2 penalty to weapon and unarmed attack rolls, Athletics checks, and acrobatics checks. You can carry 2 less Bulk than normal before becoming encumbered, and the maximum Bulk you can carry is reduced by 4.

**Duration** 10 minutes.
