The serrated blade of this _+1 striking dagger_ has a greenish tinge, and the hilt is sculpted to look like the head of a serpent about to strike.

When you critically succeed at an attack roll with the _serpent dagger_, the target becomes [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] unless it succeeds at a `DC 19 Fortitude check` save. This is a poison effect.

In addition, you can activate the dagger to poison a creature with a more potent poison.
