# Chime of Opening
## Item 6
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[magical]]


**Price** 235 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-two-hands

This hollow dawnsilver tube is about a foot long and bears engravings reminiscent of open locks and broken chains. The chime can be activated 10 times before it cracks and becomes useless.

**Activate** `pf2:1` Interact

**Effect** You aim the chime at a container, door, or lock you want to open and strike the chime. The chime sends out magical vibrations that attempt a Thievery check against the lock's DC, with a Thievery bonus of 1d20+13. This targets only one lock or binding at a time, so you might need to activate the chime multiple times to open a target with several forms of protection.
