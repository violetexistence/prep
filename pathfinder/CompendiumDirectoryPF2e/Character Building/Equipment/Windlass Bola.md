Clockwork mechanisms tick away inside the weights of these _+1 striking returning bolas_, spooling out more cord in midair.

**Activate** `pf2:1` (manipulate)

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** The cord of the bola snakes out as you throw it, allowing the weapon to wrap around a group of enemies. You use the bolas to attempt a ranged [[Actions/Trip|Trip]] against all creatures in a 5-foot burst within the weapon's first range increment. Roll a separate Athletics check for each target. Each attempt counts toward your multiple attack penalty, but don't increase your penalty until you have made all the attempts.
