This black-and-gray ammunition is etched with occult symbols and tiny, grinning skulls. When activated terrifying ammunition damages a creature, it fills the creature's mind with visions of their own failures, tragedies, and eventually, their own death. The creature must attempt a `DC 20 Will check` save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]].

**Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]] and can't reduce its frightened value below 1 until it spends an action, which has the concentrate trait, to calm itself down.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]].
