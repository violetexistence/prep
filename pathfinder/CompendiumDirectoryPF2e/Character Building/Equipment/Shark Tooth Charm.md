This dried-seaweed bracelet is lined with charms shaped like small shark teeth. When you activate the bracelet, attempt to [[Actions/Escape|Escape]] using Acrobatics with a +1 item bonus to the check. If you roll a success, you get a critical success instead (if you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead). If you fail the Acrobatics check against a grabbing creature, the creature must either release you as a free action or take 2d8 piercing damage as shark's teeth momentarily emerge from your skin.
