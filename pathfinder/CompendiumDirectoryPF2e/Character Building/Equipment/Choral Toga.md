This elegant toga is infused with inexhaustible energy to enjoy life possessed by azatas. You gain resistance to poison 20 and become immune to [[Conditions/Deafened|Deafened]]. When you invest in the robes, you either increase your Constitution score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever would give you a higher score. If you are unholy, you become deafened while wearing the toga.
