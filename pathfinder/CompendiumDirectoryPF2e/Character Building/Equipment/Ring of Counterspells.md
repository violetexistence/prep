# Ring of Counterspells
## Item 10
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[invested]][[magical]]


**Price** 925 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** worn

This ornate silver ring bears two competing geometric designs of brightly colored and wildly clashing inlaid gemstones. A spellcaster can cast a single spell into this ring as long as no spell is currently stored within, expending the normal time, costs, and so forth to Cast the Spell. The spell's effect doesn't occur; the spell's power is instead stored within the ring.

When you invest a _ring of counterspells_, you immediately know the name and rank of the spell stored inside, if any. A _ring of counterspells_ found as treasure has a 50% chance of having a spell stored in it. The GM determines that spell.

* * *

**Activate** `pf2:r` envision

**Trigger** You are targeted by or within the area of the spell stored within the ring

* * *

**Effect** You can attempt to counteract the triggering spell, using the rank of the spell stored in the ring and a counteract modifier of 1d20+19. Once you do, the stored spell's energy is spent, and the ring is empty.

* * *

**Activate** `pf2:1` command

* * *

**Effect** You harmlessly expend the stored spell, having no effect but emptying the ring so that another spell can be cast into it.
