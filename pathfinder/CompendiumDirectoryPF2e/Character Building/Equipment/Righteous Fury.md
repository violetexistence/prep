This gold-plated _+2 greater striking holy longsword_ sports an ornate hilt bearing the religious symbol of Ragathiel, General of Vengeance, and is painstakingly crafted to resemble the divine armaments wielded by the empyreal lord's celestial soldiers in their battles against the forces of darkness. These weapons are popular among the ranks of those who hold the line against similar enemies, such as the Knights of Lastwall and warriors of the former Mendevian Crusade.
