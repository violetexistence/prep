A galvanic chew is a processed ball of dried electric eel, roasted until chewy and coated in spicy, reagent-infused powder that tingles with electricity as you chew. For up to 1 hour, you have resistance 5 to electricity.

**Secondary Effect** `pf2:r` (electricity)

**Trigger** You're hit by a melee attack or touched by a creature

**Effect** You channel electricity into the triggering creature, which must succeed at a `DC 24 Fortitude check` save or be [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]] (or [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 2]] on a critical failure). The chew becomes inert. You're then temporarily immune to galvanic chews for 24 hours or until the next time you make your daily preparations.
