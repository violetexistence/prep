This _+2 greater striking [[Equipment/Shock|Shock]] greatsword_ is forged from standard-grade adamantine, with inlays of broken circuitry and a robot's ocular lens on the cross guard. A soft thrum comes from the blade, which you feel as a subtle pulse through the grip when wielding it. It sparks when unsheathed, emitting dim light within 5 feet.

On a hit against a foe made of metal, wearing metal armor, or using a metal shield, if the foe takes electricity damage from the blade, the makes the foe [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] for 1 round; if the Strike was a critical hit, it also makes them [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] for 1 round.
