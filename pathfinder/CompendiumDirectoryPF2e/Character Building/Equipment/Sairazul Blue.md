A _Sairazul blue_ potion is a rich navy blue in color. Subjects of the Crystalline Queen produced the potion to protect themselves from the radiation Ayrzul left behind. For the next 8 hours, your skin becomes navy blue, and you gain resistance 5 to poison damage and void damage.

If you drop to 0 Hit Points due to poison or void damage, the _Sairazul blue_ within your body reacts, healing you for 8d8 healing Hit Points. The resistances the potion grants then end.
