A thumb-sized feline carved of rare stone, the _jade cat_ is typically worn as a pendant upon a suit of armor. For 1 minute after you activate the cat, you treat all falls as 20 feet shorter, you are not [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] when you Balance, and narrow surfaces and uneven ground are not difficult terrain for you.
