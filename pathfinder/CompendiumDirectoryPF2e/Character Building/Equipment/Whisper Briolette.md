This teardrop-shaped gemstone has triangular facets and looks suitable for fancy attire, although close inspection shows that it's hollow. When it's activated, you can instantly impart up to 1 minute of speech (roughly 150 words) telepathically to any creatures you choose within 100 feet. You can impart this instantaneous telepathic message to creatures that you perceive and creatures [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] to you, but you can't do so to [[Conditions/Undetected|Undetected]] creatures. Once used, the whisper briolette becomes unusable and subtly vanishes within the next few minutes, rather than crumbling to dust.
