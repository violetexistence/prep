# Bracers of Hammers
## Item 17
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[apex]][[invested]][[magical]]


**Price** 15000 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** wornbracers

These brilliant golden bracers feature a hammer motif as part of their engravings. While wearing them, your body surges with strength and you gain a +3 item bonus to Athletics checks and a +1 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks to [[Actions/Disarm|Disarm]] and [[Actions/Trip|Trip]]. If you succeed, but not critically succeed, at your check to Disarm a creature, the effects of your check last until the start of your next turn, instead until the start of the target's turn. If you succeed at a check to Trip a creature, it takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage or 4d6 bludgeoning damage on a critical success. When you invest the bracers, you either increase your Strength modifier by 1 or increase it to +4, whichever would give you a higher score.

**Activate** `pf2:2` Interact

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** You reach for a foe and attempt to topple them with a powerful flip. Attempt an Athletics check to Trip a creature within reach. On a success, the creature is knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] and takes 10d6 bludgeoning damage (double on a critical hit). If you knock the creature prone, it must also attempt a `DC 35 Reflex check` save. On a failure, it drops any items it's holding.
