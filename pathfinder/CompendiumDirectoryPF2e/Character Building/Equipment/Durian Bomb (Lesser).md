Whereas a durian's aroma ranges from pleasant to revolting depending on the person, a durian bomb is a fruit that's been alchemically modified for maximum revulsion.

On a successful Strike, a durian bomb deals the 1d4 piercing damage to the target. Any creature hit by the bomb or in its splash area must attempt a `DC 15 Fortitude check` saving throw. Creatures in the splash area treat the results of their saving throw as one step better. Creatures sickened by a durian bomb are unable to smell anything else while the sickened condition lasts, suppressing any scent special sense they might have.

Once a creature is sickened by a durian bomb, they're immune to the sickened condition caused by other durian bombs for 1 minute.
