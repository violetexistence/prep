When a once-in-a-lifetime alignment of the stars shone through the roof of a secluded blacksmith's forge, the smith took advantage to craft their masterpiece. For two hours, they hammered a lump of ordinary steel into a divine blade, etching constellations and wards down its length, then shared their creation's formula with a small group of close associates before passing away.

These weapons are the four-tiger blades, and currently, only a dozen are known to existâ€”one associated with each month of the year. Each weapon is a _+2 striking ghost touch longsword_ that leaves a noticeable trail of light originating from the engraved stars when it's swung. Those who pay close attention to the pattern of stars that shine on the blade might note that the depicted constellations change according to those currently in the night sky above.
