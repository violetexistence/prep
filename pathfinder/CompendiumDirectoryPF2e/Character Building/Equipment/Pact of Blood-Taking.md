# Pact of Blood-Taking
## Item 5
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[contract]][[invested]][[magical]]


**Price** 0 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

**Devil** [[Bestiary 1/Barbazu|Barbazu]]

**Decipher Writing** Society, Warfare Lore

* * *

You negotiate for might and viciousness.

**Benefit** Your successful Strikes with slashing and piercing melee weapons deal 1 bleed damage. On a critical success, this persistent bleed damage is equal to half your level.

**Payment** You regain half the normal number of Hit Points from resting (including Hit Points gained from long-term rest) and from any application of the Medicine skill.

**Hidden Condition** The barbazu owns any weapons you find. No more often than once per month, the barbazu can demand a single weapon of its choice (often the best weapon in your possession). You are compelled to hand over the weapon immediately, without question.

**Termination Clause** The contract guarantees that you will not "be slain by the barbazu or by barbazu action." This wording is vague; if any barbazu kills you, or if you die from persistent bleed damage from any source, the contract is voided.
