### [[grimoire]][[incapacitation]][[magical]][[shadow]][[teleportation]]


**Price** 21000 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

Shadows swirl around this soot-black tome, swallowing up any light that touches them. A faint whispering emanates from the grimoire's pages when opened.

**Activate** `pf2:1` (concentrate)

**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** Your last action was to cast a spell prepared from this grimoire that has the shadow trait

* * *

**Effect** Your shadow, and that of the tome, elongates and reaches hungrily for one foe within 30 feet, who must attempt a `Fortitude check` save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature is [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] for 1 round and [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]] as the shadows scrape across it.

**Failure** The creature is blinded for 1 minute and [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 2]] as the shadows seize it.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the shadows also pull the creature into the tome, teleporting it to the Netherworld.
