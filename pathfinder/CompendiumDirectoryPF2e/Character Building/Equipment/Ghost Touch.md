# Ghost Touch
## Item 4
### [[magical]]


**Price** 75 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** etched-onto-a-weapon

A weapon etched with this rune can harm creatures without physical form. A _ghost touch_ weapon is particularly effective against incorporeal creatures, which almost always have a specific vulnerability to _ghost touch_ weapons.

Incorporeal creatures can touch, hold, and wield _ghost touch_ weapons (unlike most physical objects).
