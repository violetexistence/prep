# Leaper's Elixir (Greater)
## Item 7
### [[alchemical]][[consumable]][[elixir]]

**Category** elixir; 
**Price** 55 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

**Activate** `pf2:1` Interact

This tingly solution increases the elasticity and contraction of your leg muscles. For 1 minute after drinking this elixir, you can [[Actions/High Jump|High Jump]] or [[Actions/Long Jump|Long Jump]] as a single action instead of 2 actions. If you do, you don't perform the initial Stride (nor do you fail if you don't Stride 10 feet).

The maximum vertical distance you can jump with a High Jump is the same as you can jump horizontally with a Long Jump.
