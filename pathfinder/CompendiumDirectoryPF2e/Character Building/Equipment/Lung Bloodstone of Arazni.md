**Activate—Admonish** `pf2:2` (auditory, emotion, incapacitation, mental)

**Requirements** You worship Arazni or are favored by her

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** You point your finger at a creature within 60 feet that has wronged you, and you verbally admonish them. The creature takes 1d4 mental damage for every level you have (`Will check` save against your class DC). On a failed save, the creature is also [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]] ([[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 3]] on a critical failure).

**Destruction** To destroy the _Lung Bloodstone_, a worshipper of Arazni must willingly impale themself with the Bloodstone's horned figurehead, dealing themselves 3d6 piercing damage and 3d6 persistent bleed damage. The _Lung Bloodstone_ then evaporates into a cloud of noxious vapors, as [[Spells/Toxic Cloud|Toxic Cloud]] (DC 28), that follows the creature that destroyed the _Bloodstone_ for its duration.
