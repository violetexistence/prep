_Storm breaths_ are bottles of temperamental lightning captured during storms on the Plane of Air, releasing small charges of static energy any time they're touched. The first _storm breaths_ were created by Ranginori's faithful following the Elemental Lord's return from a long imprisonment, but the recipe has since been duplicated across the multiverse.

After inhaling _storm breath_, you gain resistance 5 to both electricity and sonic. You can exhale the _storm breath_ as a bolt of lightning, dealing 4d12 electricity damage to all creatures in a 30-foot line, with a `DC 25 Reflex check` save.
