# Marvelous Calliope
## Item 4
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[magical]][[structure]]


**Price** 100 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

This large slide whistle appears to be made of fine brass, the sides of which are engraved with musical notes and dancing clowns.

* * *

**Activate** 1 minute (command, envision, Interact)

**Effect** You blow a tune upon the slide whistle, causing the whistle to expand. The whistle sprouts from one into several, and then creates a large wooden frame and keyboard. By the time the unfolding is complete, the whistle fully transforms into a calliope, a wagon-sized contraption consisting of several steam whistles played like an organ. The calliope is heavy and anchored in place.

You have a +1 item bonus to Performance checks to play the calliope. The calliope has a tendency to produce music for a few seconds after you cease playing it, adding a jaunty and overlong conclusion to your music.

If you use an Interact action to pull the small metal ring on the underside of the _marvelous calliope_, the calliope collapses back down into a slide whistle.

* * *

**Activate** `pf2:2` Interact

**Frequency** once per hour

**Effect** You play the calliope, causing it to cast [[Spells/Charm|Charm]] on one of the listeners.
