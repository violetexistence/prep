# Codebreaker's Parchment
## Item 3
### [[illusion]][[magical]]


**Price** 45 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-two-hands

This finely crafted, seemingly mundane parchment is useful for writing sensitive documents. When words are written on this parchment, they instantly scramble into unrecognizable script, requiring a DC 20 check to Decipher Writing.

* * *

**Activate** `pf2:1` command

* * *

**Effect** The scrambled words align into the originally written script. Identifying the parchment reveals that it can be activated with a command, but a critical success to Identify Magic is needed to learn the command word.

* * *

**Activate** `pf2:1` Interact

* * *

**Effect** You light the parchment on fire, burning the words off while leaving the parchment unharmed and ready to bear more text.
