# Shining Ammunition
## Item 1
### [[consumable]][[light]][[magical]]

**Category** ammo; 
**Price** 3 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

_Shining ammunition_ gives off a faint glow. When shot, it sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius (and dim light to the next 20 feet) for 10 minutes. If it hits a target, it sticks, causing the target to shed light in the same radius. A creature can remove the ammunition with an Interact action, but the ammunition itself continues to glow for the rest of the duration or until destroyed.
