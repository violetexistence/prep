# Reverberating Stone (Greater)
## Item 15
### [[consumable]][[magical]][[talisman]]

**Category** talisman; 
**Price** 1200 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** affixed-to-a-shield

**Activate** `pf2:0` (concentrate)

**Trigger** You use the affixed shield to Shield Block a melee attack

**Requirements** You're a master in Athletics, and you have the affixed shield raised.

* * *

This heavy metal emblem is mounted on the face of the affixed shield and has a dull gray gemstone embedded at its center. When you Activate the talisman, the gem shatters, releasing a powerful shockwave in a 30-foot cone that must include the enemy who struck the triggering blow, if possible. Each creature in the cone takes 3d6 sonic with a `DC 34 Fortitude check`. Any creature that fails its save is pushed 5 feet away from you (or 10 feet on a critical failure).
