# Spiritsight Ring
## Item 6
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[invested]][[magical]]


**Price** 225 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** worn

The opal set in this intricately carved ivory ring eventually becomes translucent and tickles your finger whenever an incorporeal creature is nearby. When in the presence of a nearby incorporeal creature, even if it's within a solid object, you eventually detect the creature, though you might not do so instantly, and you can't pinpoint the location. This acts as a vague sense, similar to humans' sense of smell. An incorporeal creature trying to hide its presence from this sense attempts a Stealth check against your Perception DC to hide from your vague sense, as normal for attempting to foil special senses. You gain a +2 item bonus when using the [[Actions/Seek|Seek]] action to find [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] or [[Conditions/Undetected|Undetected]] incorporeal creatures within 30 feet of you.
