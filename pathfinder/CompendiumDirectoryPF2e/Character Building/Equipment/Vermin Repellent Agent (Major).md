This specialized cream serves as a repellent to stave off insects.

The repellent also binds with a number of common insect venoms, dulling the potency and giving the wearer's immune system a boost to resist venoms.

Once applied to your skin, the repellent grants you a +4 item bonus to Fortitude saving throws against poisons for 4 hours.
