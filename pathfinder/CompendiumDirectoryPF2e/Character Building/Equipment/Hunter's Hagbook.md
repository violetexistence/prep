This magical book has its official title, The _Grimoire of Lady Jayne Cutter_, written on an inside page in illuminated letters. Among occultists and other scholars, it's known by its colloquial name: the Hunter's Hagbook. The book is a grimoire created and used by a legendary Varisian monster hunter. The _Hunter's Hagbook_ can hold 100 spells but the spells below are always present in the book, can't be removed from it, and count against the total.

When you attempt a saving throw against a coven spell, you can immediately end the duration of a spell affecting you that you prepared from this book. If you do, the result of your saving throw is one degree of success better than your roll (for example, a critical failure becomes a failure).
