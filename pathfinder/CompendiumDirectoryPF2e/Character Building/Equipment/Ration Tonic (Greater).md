This slender vial appears to hold clean, clear water with a faintly fruity scent. Drinking a ration tonic magically nourishes you with the equivalent of a week's worth of food and water, distributing the nourishment in a constant and healthy flow across the week. The tonic has a subtle, pleasant taste, its particulars chosen when the potion is crafted.
