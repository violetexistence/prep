A _hell staff_ is a tall, pointed staff forged of red-tinted steel with Diabolic inscriptions that march neatly down its sides. At its top sits an inverted ruby pyramid divided into nine sections. Found mostly in Cheliax or other lands where diabolic influences hold sway, when used as a weapon the staff is a _+3 greater striking flaming unholy staff_. When you prepare this staff, if you're holy, you become [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]] until your next daily preparations.

The staff's _summon lesser servitor spell_ can be used only to summon animals with the fiend trait, devils, or hell hounds (at 4th rank). Its _summon fiend_ spell can summon only devils or hell hounds.
