| **Category** martial melee weapon | **Group** club |

| **Bulk** 2 | **Size** med |
| **Damage** 3d10 bludgeoning  | **Usage** held-in-two-hands |



Shaped like a blade made from spinning gears, this _+2 greater striking_ weapon can catch enemy weapons and grind up foes. In order to function, the _gearblade_ must be wound for 10 minutes once every 24 hours. During this process, you can reconfigure the weapon to transform into a bastard sword, greatsword, longsword, or shortsword. It then gains all the features of the chosen weapon except that its Bulk is always 2 and it gains the disarm weapon trait and the versatile B weapon trait (which replaces any other versatile trait the weapon might have). If you don't wind the gearblade, it becomes inert and has the statistics of a greatclub.

**Activate** `pf2:1` envision

**Frequency** once per day

**Requirements** You've wound the gearblade for 10 minutes within the last 24 hours

**Trigger** You roll a critical success to [[Actions/Disarm|Disarm]] a target with the gearblade

* * *

**Effect** The target's weapon is pulled through the gearblade's gears and shoots out the other side, landing 20 feet away in a direction of your choice. The target must attempt a `DC 36 Reflex check` save. On a failure, the limb holding their weapon is also pulled into the _gearblade_, and the creature takes 3d12 bludgeoning damage. On a critical failure, they take 6d12 bludgeoning damage and the limb becomes unusable until healed by a [[Spells/Regenerate|Regenerate]] spell or a similar effect.
