| **Damage** 3d6 bludgeoning  | **Usage** held-in-one-hand |



The handle, chain, and spiked ball of this _+3 greater striking greater corrosive flail_ are all made of iron so rusted that the weapon appears nonfunctional at first glance. On Strikes against a creature that's primarily made of metal, it gains the deadly d10 trait.

**Activateâ€”Rusting Disarm** `pf2:r`

**Trigger** You critically succeed at a [[Actions/Disarm|Disarm]] attempt with the flail against a metal weapon

**Effect** Flakes of acid-laden rust are deposited on the disarmed weapon. The weapon takes 4d6 acid damage, ignoring the weapon's Hardness.
