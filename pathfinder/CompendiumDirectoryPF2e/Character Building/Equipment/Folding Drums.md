# Folding Drums
## Item 5
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[magical]]


**Price** 160 gp; 
**Bulk** 1; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

You can unfold this [[Equipment/Musical Instrument (Virtuoso heavy)|virtuoso percussion instrument]] into a hand drum (1 Bulk), a marching drum set with a shoulder harness and back brace (3 Bulk), or a large standing drum set with a built-in stool (16 Bulk). Changing the _folding drum_'s size is a 3-action Interact activity, and the drums must have sufficient open space to accommodate their new size.

**Activate** `pf2:1` Interact (concentrate)

**Frequency** once per hour

**Effect** You play a pounding rhythm on the drum. If the next action you use is to cast a composition cantrip that has an emanation, increase the area of the emanation by 30 feet.
