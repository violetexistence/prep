# Resonating Crystal Boots
## Item 8
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[invested]][[magical]]


**Price** 475 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** worn

These supple leather boots are studded with tiny crystals.

**Activateâ€”Chiming Steps** `pf2:1` (auditory, concentrate, sonic)

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** Stride up to half your Speed. The crystals ring out with pleasant-sounding chimes that reverberate painfully in the ears of others. Each creature that you pass adjacent to during your Stride takes 4d8 sonic damage (`DC 24 Fortitude check` save); a creature takes this damage only once. A creature who critically fails the save is also [[Conditions/Deafened|Deafened]] for 1 minute.
