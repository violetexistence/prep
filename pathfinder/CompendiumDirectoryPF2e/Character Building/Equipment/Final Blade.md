A Large or smaller restrained or willing creature can be executed by a final blade.

* * *

**Activate** 1 minute (Interact)

* * *

**Effect** You execute a creature restrained beneath the blade. The creature you execute takes 11d10 slashing damage and must succeed at a `DC 45 Fortitude check` save or be decapitated as though it suffered a critical hit with a natural 20 from a _+3 major striking vorpal scythe_. The soul of a creature executed with a final blade is trapped, and the creature can't be returned to life, not even by miracle or similar magic. A final blade can hold any number of souls in this way, and a sufficient number of captured souls forms a monster called a gray death.

**Destruction** A final blade can be destroyed via the rare ritual, blunt the final blade.
