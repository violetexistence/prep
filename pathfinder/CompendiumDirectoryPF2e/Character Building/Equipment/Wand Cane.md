# Wand Cane
## Item 4
### [[magical]][[wand]]


**Price** 100 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

Though it appears to be a basic cane, the inner workings of the _wand cane_ are an intricate network of lenses and magical circuits, with a slot at the top to insert a wand. The _wand cane_ then spends 1 minute attuning to the wand, after which the wand can be used through the cane.
