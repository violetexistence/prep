This pigmented dust is often used to add color to the lights of a performance. Prismatic dust can be activated while you are adjacent to a source of magical bright light. When activated, the dust is sprinkled into the light, changing the light's color into the color of the dust for 1 hour. The color of the dust is determined upon the dust's creation.
