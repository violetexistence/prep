This liquid contains blood from a wyrmling green dragon. For 1 hour after you drink it, you can unleash a cloud of poison as a breath weapon. Exhaling dragon breath uses a single action. The breath weapon deals 2d6 poison damage in a 15-foot cone, and each creature in the area must attempt a `DC 23 Fortitude check` save. After you use the breath weapon, you can't do so again for 1d4 rounds.
