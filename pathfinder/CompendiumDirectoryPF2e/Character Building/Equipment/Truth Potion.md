For 10 minutes after drinking this astringent potion, you can't intentionally lie and may be compelled to tell the truth. Upon drinking the potion, attempt a `DC 19 Will check` save. You can voluntarily fail or critically fail.

**Success** The potion does not affect you.

**Failure** When you speak, you must tell the truth.

**Critical Failure** As failure, and when someone asks you a question, you must attempt another `DC 19 Will check` saving throw. If you fail this saving throw, you must answer the question truthfully if you are able to do so; if you succeed, you are temporarily immune to further attempts to ask the same question within the potion's duration.
