This gold-and-ivory incense burner always emits a pleasant, floral-scented smoke without any need to be refilled. It has a chain that can be easily affixed to a belt or bag, allowing it to be worn without a free hand. As long as the censer is burning, the bearer benefits from the _Undetectable Alignment_ spell. They also don't appear undead to divination spells or abilities, or to senses such as lifesense, unless those abilities successfully counteract the censer. The censer can be lit or extinguished with an Interact action.
