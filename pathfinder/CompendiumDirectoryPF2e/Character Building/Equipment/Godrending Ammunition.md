# Godrending Ammunition
## Item 13
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[consumable]][[magical]]

**Category** ammo; 
**Price** 440 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

Embedded in this piece of ammunition is a shining sliver of a warshard. When an activated godrending ammunition hits a target, the body of the struck creature attempts to tear itself apart, causing nauseating pain. Instead of its normal damage, the ammunition deals 10d8 slashing damage. The target can attempt a `DC 30 Fortitude check` saving throw; it takes a â€“2 circumstance penalty to this save if the Strike was a critical hit.

* * *

**Critical Success** The foe takes the normal damage from the ammunition, instead of the 10d8 slashing damage.

**Success** The foe takes half damage.

**Failure** The foe takes full damage and is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]].

**Critical Failure** The foe takes double damage and is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]]. A creature reduced to 0 HP from this damage is ripped limb from limb, and it instantly dies; its gear remains.
