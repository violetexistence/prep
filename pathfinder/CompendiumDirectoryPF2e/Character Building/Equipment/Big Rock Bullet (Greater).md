A big rock bullet is a sling bullet made of heavy granite, but each piece of ammunition feels much more dense than it appears. When activated, a big rock bullet transforms into a giant rock just before hitting the target. The target takes 8d6 bludgeoning damage on a successful hit. Even on a failed attack roll (but not a critical failure), the target takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage. Creatures with the [[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Catch Rock|Catch Rock]] reaction can use it against a big rock bullet.
