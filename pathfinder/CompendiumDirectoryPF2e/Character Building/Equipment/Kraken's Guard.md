**Effect** You unleash the kraken's wrath. You Raise the Shield. The shield's appendages briefly extend to impossible length as they wriggle and lash out at your foes, dealing 10d10 bludgeoning damage to all enemies in a 30-foot cone (`DC 41 Reflex check` save). The shield remains animated for 1 minute, during which you can use it to Grapple a creature within 10 feet of you without needing a free hand. When you use the shield to Grapple, you gain a +3 item bonus to your Athletics check.
