# Fan of Soothing Winds (Greater)
## Item 15
### [[air]][[magical]]


**Price** 6500 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

This fan of _soothing winds_ has six cloud-shaped glass beads on the bottom of the fan, one on each of the exposed ribs. One side of the beads is white, and the other is a dark, stormy gray. Once flipped, a bead stays on its newly exposed side for an entire day before resetting overnight.

**Activate—Healing Wind** `pf2:2` (concentrate)

**Frequency** once per day per bead

* * *

**Effect** You open your fan and turn a bead of your choice. The fan casts a 3-action [[Spells/Heal|Heal]] spell with an area of a 30-foot cone instead of a 30-foot emanation; the save DC for an undead creature is 34. This spell gains the air trait. The rank of the spell depends on which bead you're turning: the first two beads cast 6th-rank _heal_, the center two cast 5th-rank _heal_, and the last two cast 4th-rank _heal_.
