A shatterstone is a small ceramic orb. Inside are reactive agents that set up an intense field of sonic vibration when the stone breaks. The bomb grants a +3 item bonus to attack rolls and deals 4d6 sonic damage and 4 sonic splash damage. Much of the sound is ultrasonic, and creatures with sonic weakness that take damage from the bomb must succeed at a `DC 40 Fortitude check` save or be [[Conditions/Deafened|Deafened]] until the end of their next turn.
