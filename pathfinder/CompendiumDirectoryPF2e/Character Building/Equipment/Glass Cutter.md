# Glass Cutter

### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")


**Price** 5 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-two-hands

This small rod has a tiny, sharp cutting wheel made of steel on one end and a thick bulb on the other. You can use the glass cutter's wheel to score ordinary glass and use the bulb to break the piece along your scoring. It typically takes 1 minute of work to cut a hole large enough to fit your hand. If you are attempting to break the glass quietly, you must attempt a `Thievery check` check against the Perception DC of nearby creatures to go unnoticed.
