This talisman is a ring of dried, interwoven pieces of straw. When you activate the _hunter's bane_, you sense the exact location of the attacker. It becomes [[Conditions/Observed|Observed]] by you if it was hidden from you or becomes hidden from you if it was undetected. If the attacker is behind lead, the _hunter's bane_ has no effect.
