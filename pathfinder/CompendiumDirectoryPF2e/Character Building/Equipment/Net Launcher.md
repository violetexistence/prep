# Net Launcher
## Item 1
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")


**Price** 16 gp; 
**Bulk** 1; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-two-hands

This wide, hollow tube is two to three feet long and fires an unattached net at much greater range than one can be thrown. A net launcher can be wielded while propped up on your shoulder or cradled under your arm. A net must be carefully folded to be launched without tangling. Properly loading a net into a net launcher takes 1 minute. A net fired with a net launcher can target a Medium or smaller creature within 40 feet, rather than 20 feet.
