# Torrent Snare
## Item 3
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[consumable]][[magical]][[snare]][[trap]]

**Category** snare; 
**Price** 9 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

You pile waterlogged plants or access a nearby source of water to rain down on a Medium or smaller creature that enters the snare's square. When a creature enters the square, the snare's square and all adjacent squares become slippery difficult terrain, and the triggering creature must attempt a `DC 19 Reflex check` saving throw, with the following effects.

**Success** The target is unaffected.

**Failure** The target falls prone.

**Critical Failure** The target falls prone and is forced into one of the other squares soaked by the snare.
