Rather than passing on when they feel their death approaching, a rare few elderly arboreals undergo a ritual of preservation. This rite fuses the arboreal's consciousness into a branch, allowing their spirit to live on within the object. The branch functions as a greater verdant staff, though the arboreal spirit allows only partners willing to safeguard nature to use the staff's spells. An arboreal who decides to become an _arboreal staff_ is more connected to shorter-lived species than others of their kind. Most choose to endure to share their knowledge with future generations, but they take a long view in ways that can be frustrating to their wielders.

In addition to the activation and spells of a greater verdant staff, an arboreal staff can cast the spells it holds as if it were the staff's wielder, though it usually does so only to benefit a partner. The staff also has [[Spells/Earthbind|Earthbind]] available as a 3rd-rank spell.

**Activate** Cast a Spell

**Effect** You expend a number of charges from the staff to cast a spell from its list.
