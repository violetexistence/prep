The steel head of this _+1 striking earthbreaker_ has a large crack that zigzags down its center, making it look like it could crack in half with any swing. This belies the hammer's strength; its strikes can shatter stone with ease.

**Trigger** You Strike an object or raised shield with the faultline hammer and would deal piercing damage to that object
