# Swim Fins

### 


**Price** 5 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** wornshoes

These flippers attach to your feet like tight shoes-donning or removing them requires three Interact actions. While worn, you gain a +5-foot item bonus to the distance you move when rolling Athletics to Swim, not when using a swim Speed, and you take a -10-foot item penalty to your Speed.
