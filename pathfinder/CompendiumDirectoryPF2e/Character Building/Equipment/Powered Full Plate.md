**Category** heavy; **Group** plate
**Price** 360 gp; 
**Bulk** 4; **Size** med
**Usage** wornarmor

Stasian actuators help the limbs of this full plate move of their own accord, as long as they're supplied with power. A chamber in the chest plate can hold a single [[Equipment/Bottled Lightning (Lesser)|Bottled Lightning]], which takes 3 Interact actions to install.

**Activate** `pf2:1` (manipulate)

**Requirements** A bottled lightning is installed in the armor

* * *

**Effect** The armor powers up for 10 minutes. While it's powered up, add the bottled lightning's item bonus to your Athletics checks to [[Actions/Force Open|Force Open]], [[Actions/High Jump|High Jump]], [[Actions/Long Jump|Long Jump]], and [[Actions/Shove|Shove]]. The armor's Strength requirement is lowered by 1, or by 2 if the loaded bottled lightning's item bonus to attack rolls is +3 or higher. The armor's normal penalties still apply, based on this altered Strength. The activation uses up the bottled lightning, and the armor can't be activated again until a new one is installed.
