_The Snakebite_ represents poison, assassination, and disharmony. As long as you have _The Snakebite_ invested, it grants you a +2 item bonus to Deception and Stealth checks you make for initiative. This increases to a +3 item bonus if you're at least 17th level. The DCs of your poison effects have a +1 item bonus to targets that are [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] to you when you afflict the target with the poison (the DC retains this bonus for the target's subsequent saves against the affliction, even if the target is no longer off-guard to you).

**Effect** You cast [[Spells/Purple Worm Sting|Purple Worm Sting]] on a creature within your reach, with a DC equal to your class DC or spell DC (`Fortitude check`).
