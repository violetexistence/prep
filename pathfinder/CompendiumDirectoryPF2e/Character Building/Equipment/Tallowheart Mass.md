# Tallowheart Mass
## Item 8
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[divine]][[healing]]


**Price** 425 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

This disgusting mass of magically-infused hardened tallow is often found divided into three portions, each attached to the other by a thin tangle of fibers and hair. While some create _tallowheart masses_ that are connected via lengths of scented cord or even fine chain, the mass of tallow is always off-putting in texture, scent, and appearance. Despite the mass's unpleasant look, this magical item can be quite helpful. Each of the three portions can be activated in one of three ways, but once a portion is activated, it's consumed. Once you've consumed all three portions, you fully expend the _tallowheart mass_.
