This magical bulb is harvested from an ancient grove rich in primal plant magic. When you activate the bulb, you either eat it to have it cast a 5th-rank [[Spells/Plant Form|Plant Form]] spell affecting you, or plant it in the ground next to you to have it cast a 5th-rank [[Spells/Summon Plant or Fungus|Summon Plant or Fungus]] spell. If you choose the summoning option, the plant or fungus appears where you planted the bulb, and you can Sustain the activation to keep control of the creature.
