This pink flower has long, slender thorns along the stem. The flower can be used as a catalyst when casting an [[Spells/Entangling Flora|Entangling Flora]] spell, which causes the affected plants to sprout long thorns and vibrant pink blossoms. The area becomes hazardous terrain, dealing the 2 piercing damage to an enemy each time it enters an affected square.
