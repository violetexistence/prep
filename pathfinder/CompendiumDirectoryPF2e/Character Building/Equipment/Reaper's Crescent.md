The blade of this alabaster _+1 striking sickle_ grows thick and pitted as the moon waxes, and it thins to a sharp sliver as the moon wanes. Moonlight also causes a second rune on the blade to change shape with the moon's phases: during the new and crescent moon, the weapon has the _[[Equipment/Ghost Touch|Ghost Touch]]_ rune; during the quarter moon, the _[[Equipment/Fearsome|Fearsome]]_ rune; and during the gibbous and full moon, the _[[Equipment/Wounding|Wounding]]_ rune.

When wielded under moonlight of any strength, the _reaper's crescent_ deals additional cold damage equal to the number of damage dice.
