A _ghostcracker_ pops and smokes when consumed. When you throw the _ghostcracker_ down in your space as part of casting an [[Spells/Illusory Creature|Illusory Creature]] spell, the appearance of the creature twists nightmarishly. When an enemy's attack or spell ends the _illusory creature_ spell, the creature "dies" in a disturbing fashion, rendering the enemy [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]]. From this effect, the ghostcracker adds the emotion, fear, and mental traits to the spell.
