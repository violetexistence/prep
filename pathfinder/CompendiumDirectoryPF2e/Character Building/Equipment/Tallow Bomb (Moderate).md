A mixture of rendered animal fat and acids designed to ignite the fat when exposed to air, a tallow bomb creates a splash of burning oil that adheres to skin, clothes, and hair. A tallow bomb deals the listed fire damage, persistent fire damage, and splash damage.

On a critical hit, a living creature taking persistent fire damage from a tallow bomb is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] from the stench of burning fat and can't reduce its sickened value below 1 while the persistent fire damage lasts.

You gain a +1 item bonus to attack rolls. The bomb deals 2d4 persistent fire damage and 2 fire splash damage.
