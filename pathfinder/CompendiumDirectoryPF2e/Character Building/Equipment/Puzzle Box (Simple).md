# Puzzle Box (Simple)

### 


**Price** 2 sp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

A puzzle box features moving parts, locking mechanisms, and other components designed to confound the user. Solving a puzzle box typically requires three successful DC 15 Games Lore or `DC 15 Thievery check` checks to Open a Lock, though puzzle boxes come in countless configurations and themes, and the GM can determine which skills are appropriate.
