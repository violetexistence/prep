# Osteomancer's Pouch
## Item 8
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[magical]]


**Price** 480 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

This leather pouch holds a pair of six-sided dice carved from actual knucklebones. When rolled, the dice grant you a vision of a distant location, though their power is unreliable.

**Activate—Roll the Bones** `pf2:2` (concentrate, manipulate)

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You roll the dice. If you roll two 1s, the activation fails with no effect. Otherwise, the dice cast [[Spells/Clairvoyance|Clairvoyance]] for you. When cast in this way, the spell's range becomes 100 feet × the result of your roll.
