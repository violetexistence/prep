A fearcracker contains fragments of broken mirrors and reagents that pop and smoke when consumed. When thrown down in your space as part of a [[Spells/Mirror Image|Mirror Image]] spell, your and your images' appearance twists nightmarishly. When an image is destroyed, it "dies" in a disturbing fashion, rendering the attacker [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]]. This aspect of the spell has the emotion, fear, and mental traits.
