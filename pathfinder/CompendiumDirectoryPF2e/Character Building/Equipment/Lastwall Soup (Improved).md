Crimson Reclaimers make this rich, hearty soup using herbs that baffle the senses of the undead. A bowl of Lastwall soup is as nourishing as a full meal. Gravelands Herbalists have spent time with the Knights of Lastwall, and have learned how to improve upon Lastwall soup.

For 1 hour after consuming a bowl of improved Lastwall soup, you gain a +3 item bonus to Stealth checks and DCs against undead.
