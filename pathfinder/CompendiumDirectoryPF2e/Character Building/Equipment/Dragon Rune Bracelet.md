A _dragon rune bracelet_ is a gold bangle formed around the scale of a famous dragon. The bracelet is etched with esoteric symbols or words in Draconic that indicate kinship with dragons. As many types of _dragon rune bracelet_ exist as there are types of dragons, though bracelets associated with uncommon or rare dragons have the same rarity as the dragon.

While wearing a _dragon rune bracelet_, you gain a +2 item bonus to Diplomacy checks while interacting with dragons of the same type as the bracelet's scale (such as red dragons or cloud dragons). You also gain a +2 item bonus to saving throws against fear effects from any kind of dragon.
