The blade of this _+1 striking dagger_ is made from the thigh bone of a canine that died in the act of protecting its master. A werecreature or other creature willingly under the effects of a non-permanent polymorph effect damaged by a _dog-bone knife_ must attempt a `DC 19 Will check` save or immediately revert to its natural form-this has no effect on a creature unwillingly polymorphed. On a successful save, the creature is temporarily immune to this effect for 1 minute. Kushtakas and other creatures vulnerable to canines take a -2 circumstance penalty to saves against this effect, and this weapon overcomes any resistance such creatures have to physical attacks.
