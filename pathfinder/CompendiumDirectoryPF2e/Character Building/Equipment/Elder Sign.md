# Elder Sign
## Item 25
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[artifact]][[occult]]


**Price** 0 gp; 
**Bulk** 1; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

This stone tablet is carved with the symbol of a five-branched twig. There are only a limited number of elder signs, and each time one is destroyed, the universe's doom creeps inexorably closer. Reciting one of three different occult mantras (`DC 20 Occultism check` check to do so correctly) allows three different activations. All three abilities work only on a creature connected to the Elder Mythos or a cosmic horror, such as a wendigo or gug; the activations refer to them as "eldritch creatures."

**Activate** `pf2:2` command, envision, Interact

**Effect** The _elder sign_ casts a 10th-rank banishment spell on an eldritch creature. Even if the creature isn't extraplanar, the _elder sign_ can still banish it, sending it back to the part of the Material Plane from which it originated. If the creature is a Great Old One, the _elder sign_ banishes it automatically (as if it critically failed its save) but is then forever destroyed.

**Activate** `pf2:2` command, envision, Interact

**Effect** The _elder sign_ casts dispel magic on an effect from an eldritch creature, using a counteract rank of 10 and +30 modifier for the roll.

**Activate** `pf2:2` command, envision, Interact

* * *

**Effect** The _elder sign_ casts dimensional lock, though it wards against travel by only eldritch creatures. Each time the _elder sign_ casts _dimensional lock_ in this way, the previous _dimensional lock_ spell ends.

**Destruction** The only way to destroy an _elder sign_ is to use it to banish a Great Old One.
