## Item 1
### [[consumable]][[magical]]

**Category** other; 
**Price** 3 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

This flat piece of hard stone is specially prepared for etching a magical fundamental rune or property rune. You can etch only one rune upon a stone. When a rune is transferred from the _runestone_ to another object, the _runestone_ cracks and is destroyed. The Price listed is for an empty stone; a stone holding a rune adds the Price of the rune.
