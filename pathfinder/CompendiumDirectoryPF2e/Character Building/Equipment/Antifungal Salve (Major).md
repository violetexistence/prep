This foul-smelling pink paste is traditionally kept in a tightly sealed jar. Spreading the salve on exposed skin grants a +4 item bonus to saving throws against all afflictions that have the fungus trait or that originate from creatures with the fungus trait. The bonus lasts for 6 hours.

When you apply the salve, the target can immediately attempt a saving throw against one fungal affliction of 14th level or lower that is affecting them. If they succeed, the affliction is neutralized.
