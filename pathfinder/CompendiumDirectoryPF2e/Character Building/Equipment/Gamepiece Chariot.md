**Effect** You place the figurine on the ground and roll it forward. As the chariot begins to move, it rapidly expands to the size of a Large heavy chariot pulled by two animated stone war horses. You can board the chariot and drive it up to 80 feet in a straight line. You can move through spaces occupied by creatures of size Medium or smaller, dealing 4d8+10 bludgeoning damage to those creatures. Affected creatures must attempt a `DC 28 Reflex check` save; on a failure, a creature is knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]. The chariot returns to its figurine form once it stops moving.
