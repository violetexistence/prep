The blade of this _+2 greater striking wounding scythe_ is sharp enough to produce a whistling sound when swung through the air. The shaft is made of ebony wood with a sickly shine to it, much like the shine of infected wounds and contaminated water.

* * *

**Activate** `pf2:r` command

**Trigger** An enemy critically succeeds at an attempt to Disarm you

* * *

**Effect** As the scythe leaves your hand, it drinks the triggering creature's blood. The creature must succeed at a `DC 30 Fortitude check` save or become [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 2]] ([[Conditions/Drained|Drained 3]] on a critical failure). If the triggering creature becomes drained, you gain temporary Hit Points equal to the triggering creature's level. You lose any remaining temporary Hit Points after 1 minute.

* * *

**Activate** `pf2:r` command

**Frequency** once per hour

**Trigger** You critically succeed at a Strike against a living opponent

* * *

**Effect** The scythe drains life essence from your opponent into you. You gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to half the slashing damage the scythe dealt to the foe. You lose any remaining temporary Hit Points after 1 minute.
