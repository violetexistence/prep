# Minotaur Chair
## Item 9
### [[magical]]


**Price** 600 gp;

**Usage** worn

A _minotaur chair_ is a traveler's chair with chair storage, _impulse control_, and _+1 striking wounding wheel spikes_. The wheel spikes can have runes upgraded, transferred, or added as normal. The chair magically stores the kinetic energy from movement throughout the day, allowing you to expend it to make a powerful rushing charge.

**Effect** You rush forward with the wheelchair in a powerful charge, bowling through foes who stand in the way. Stride in a straight line, moving through enemies' spaces and making an attack with the wheel spikes against every foe in the line. If the foe is [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]], the following effects apply: the attack gains a +1 circumstance bonus to damage per weapon damage die, and the wounding rune deals 1d12 bleed on a hit (or 3d6 bleed on a critical hit).
