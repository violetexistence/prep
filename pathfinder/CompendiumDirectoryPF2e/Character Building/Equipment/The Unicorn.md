**Effect** You pass _The Unicorn_ across an adjacent closed container and then open the container. Inside, you'll find a Common consumable alchemical or magic item you need to solve a problem or deal with a situation close at hand. For example, if you're badly wounded, you might find a greater healing potion. If you've been poisoned, you could discover a panacea. If you're faced with a written clue in a language you don't understand, the container might hold a comprehension elixir. The GM always decides what consumable item is discovered, and it must be equal to or lower than your level. If the consumable isn't used within 1 minute of being discovered, the item vanishes. If there's no appropriate item to solve your situation, the GM can rule that no object is found; in this case, the daily use of The Unicorn is not expended.
