# Globe of Shrouds
## Item 8
### [[censer]][[fire]][[magical]][[revelation]]


**Price** 500 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

The body of this censer is made of transparent crystal banded with dark iron. This globe hangs from a sturdy chain attached to a simple steel rod with a smooth grip.

**Activate—Light Incense** `pf2:2` (aura, manipulate)

**Frequency** once per day

**Cost** incense worth at least 5 gp

**Effect** As you light the incense, barely visible smoke issues from the censer in a hazy 20-foot emanation. Creatures that are in the haze or later enter it are wreathed in wisps of smoke; these wisps last while the creature is in the smoke's aura and until the start of its next turn if it leaves the haze. An ally in the aura is [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] and gains a +2 status bonus to Stealth checks. Any enemy in the aura that is or becomes [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]] appears as a translucent shape to you and your allies—it's no longer [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]], but it remains concealed.
