This bright oil, first created by humans as a tool to help them fight in darkness, holds flecks of tiny gemstones in suspension and smells like a struck matchstick.

The first time a weapon coated with this oil damages a creature, the wound glows with light for 1 minute. If the creature is [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]], the light's position means it's merely [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] to creatures that would otherwise be unable to see it, rather than undetected. The light also negates the [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] condition due to lighting conditions. If the coated weapon doesn't damage a creature within 1 hour, the oil sloughs off and loses its power.
