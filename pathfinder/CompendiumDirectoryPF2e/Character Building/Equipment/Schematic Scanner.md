A _schematic scanner_ is a complex brass device featuring multiple mounted lenses, clamps, and apertures. A _schematic scanner_ can hold the formulas for items as if it were a formula book with unlimited capacity. You can add a formula to the _schematic scanner_ using the Store Schematics activation. A _schematic scanner_ grants you a +2 item bonus to Crafting checks to craft an item whose formula is stored in the _schematic scanner_.

**Activate—Store Schematics** `pf2:3` (manipulate)

You place the written formula for an item into the _schematic scanner_ and view it through the mounted lenses, magically storing a copy of the formula inside the _schematic scanner_.

**Activate—Reverse Engineer Schematics** (manipulate)

You place an item in front of the _schematic scanner_, then view the item through the mounted lenses, magically learning the formula for the targeted item, without disassembling or causing harm to the item, and storing the formula in the _schematic scanner_. Reverse engineering a formula in this way takes 10 minutes and doesn't cost any gold.
