# Blade Byrnie
## Item 7
### [[flexible]][[invested]][[magical]][[noisy]]

**Category** light; **Group** chain
**Price** 360 gp; 
**Bulk** 1; **Size** med
**Usage** wornarmor

Instead of chain links, this _+1 chain shirt_ is assembled from metal "leaves" that each resemble a small blade.

**Activate** `pf2:1` (manipulate)

* * *

**Effect** You pull a link from the armor, which transforms into a _+1 striking [[Equipment/Dagger|Dagger]]_. The dagger disappears and reappears as a link in the armor after you Strike with it, or at the end of this turn if you don't make a Strike. You can Activate the blade byrnie in place of an Interact action to draw a weapon for abilities such as the [[Feats/Quick Draw|Quick Draw]] feat.

Upgrading the runes on the blade byrnie makes the daggers pulled from it more powerful. The daggers have a _+2 weapon potency_ rune if the armor has a _+2 armor potency_ rune, or a _+3 weapon potency_ rune if the armor has a _+3 armor potency_ rune.
