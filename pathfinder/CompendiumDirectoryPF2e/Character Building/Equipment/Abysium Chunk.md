# Abysium Chunk

### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[precious]]


**Price** 450 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

A blue-green metal with an eerie green luminescence, abysium radiates power that's inimical to life. Careless exposure to the material can lead to long-term damage to the immune system; as such, mining abysium is hazardous, as large quantities of the metal in an area cause all nearby creatures to become sick.

A creature carrying an abysium object is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] for a standard-grade object of light Bulk, [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]] for a standard-grade object of 1 Bulk or more or a high-grade object of light Bulk, or [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 3]] for a high-grade object of 1 Bulk or more. This and all other sickening effects of abysium are poison effects.

Crafters can use 1 abysium chunk to create up to 6 doses of poisonous [[Equipment/Abysium Powder|Abysium Powder]]. Unscrupulous smiths have harnessed abysium's toxic properties to create noxious weapons and deadly substances.

All objects crafted from abysium shed dim light in a 10-foot radius.
