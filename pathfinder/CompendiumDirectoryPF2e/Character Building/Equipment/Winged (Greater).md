# Winged (Greater)
## Item 19
### [[magical]]


**Price** 35000 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** etched-onto-armor

This rune is a swirling glyph on the front of the armor. A large pair of transparent, ephemeral wings floats out from the back of the armor.

**Activateâ€”Take to the Skies** `pf2:2` (concentrate, manipulate)

* * *

**Effect** You trace the rune on the front of the breastplate and the armor's ephemeral wings grow tangible, granting you a fly Speed of 25 feet or your land Speed, whichever is slower.

Once activated, the wings remain tangible indefinitely. You can Dismiss the activation if you choose, and you don't have to wait an hour to activate the rune again. Once the effect ends, the wings return to their ephemeral form.
