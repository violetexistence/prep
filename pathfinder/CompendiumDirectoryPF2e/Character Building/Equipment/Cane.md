# Cane

### 


**Price** 5 sp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

A cane is a straight cane with a curved handle, shaped like the tip of a hook. Its simple design helps with balance and only slightly assists with taking weight off the affected opposite leg. The cane is typically 2 to 3 feet long but can be lengthened or shortened as needed.
