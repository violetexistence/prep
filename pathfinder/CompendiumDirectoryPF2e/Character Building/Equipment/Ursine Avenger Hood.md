A gift passed from warrior to warrior, this cowl is made from a cave bear's skull and fur. Once invested, the wearer gains a +1 item bonus to Nature checks to [[Actions/Command an Animal|Command an Animal]], which increases to +2 if the animal is a bear. The wearer of the hood feels a constant longing for the wilderness and wild places and takes a â€“1 item penalty to all Diplomacy checks to Gather Information or [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] if they go more than 5 days inside a large town or city without spending at least 4 hours in the wilderness.

**Destruction** Soak the Ursine Avenger Hood in the blood of a linnorm that is at least 16th level and then burn it in a fire that uses only oak and chrysanthemum as fuel.
