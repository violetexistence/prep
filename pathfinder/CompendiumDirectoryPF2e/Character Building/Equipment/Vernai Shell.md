Made from the finest plates of monstrous insect chitin, this _+2 greater resilient mantis shell_ offers superior protection from Mediogalti's hot weather while also allowing the wearer to blend into almost any situation and strike with hidden blades. While wearing this armor, you are protected from extreme heat and severe heat effects. _Vernai shell_ armor includes two extradimensional spaces built into each of the armor's gloves, granting the wearer two places to store items. Each glove can hold one item of 1 Bulk or less. While an item is stored in one of the two gloves, there is nothing to indicate that an item is being held inside it.
