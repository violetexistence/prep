# Wand of Shocking Haze
## Item 6
### [[magical]][[visual]][[wand]]


**Price** 250 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

Thin, shiny wires crisscross the surface of this smooth, black wand. The pommel is capped with a polished metal sphere, which sometimes emits small electric sparks.

**Activate** Cast a Spell

**Frequency** once per day, plus overcharge

* * *

**Effect** You cast [[Spells/Blur|Blur]], and the wand creates faint orbs of electricity [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] in the haze around you. Each time a creature that's adjacent to you fails a flat check against the concealment from blur, they explode one of the orbs, causing them to take 5 electricity damage.

* * *

**Craft Requirements** Supply a casting of _blur_.
