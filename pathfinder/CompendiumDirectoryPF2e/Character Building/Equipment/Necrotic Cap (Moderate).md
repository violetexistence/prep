You can use this slimy, rotting mushroom as a spell catalyst when you cast an [[Spells/Acid Grip|Acid Grip]] spell by tapping it against the target, causing the mushroom to release a cloud of necrotic spores. When you do, _acid grip_ loses the acid trait, gains the fungus trait, and all acid damage the spell deals becomes void damage. On a hit, the target additionally gains the [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 2]] and [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]] conditions as the spores consume their flesh. As long as the target is taking persistent void damage, they can't reduce the value of their sickened condition below 1.
