**Effect** You somehow manage to survive what could have been a fatal blow. Instead of being reduced to 0 Hit Points, you drop to 1 Hit Point instead and immediately restore an additional 4d8+16 healing Hit Points. The amount of Hit Point restored increases to 5d8+20 healing if you are at least 15th level, 6d8+24 healing if you're at least 17th level, and 7d8+28 healing if you're at least 19th level.
