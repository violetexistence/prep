This vial of glowing goo constantly sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius. When a bioluminescence bomb strikes a creature or a hard surface, it shatters and releases the bioluminescent fluid's energy in a flare of light. Each creature within 10 feet of where the bomb exploded must succeed at a `DC 17 Reflex check` or be marked with dye that continues to glow for 24 hours. An affected creature must also attempt a `DC 17 Fortitude check` saving throw against the overwhelming burst of light.

* * *

**Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] for 1 round.

**Critical Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] for 1 round, then dazzled for 1 round.
