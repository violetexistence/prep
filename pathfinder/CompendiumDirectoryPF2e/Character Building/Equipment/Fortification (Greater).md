# Fortification (Greater)
## Item 18
### [[magical]]


**Price** 24000 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** etched-onto-med-heavy-armor

A _greater fortification_ rune wards against the most deadly attacks. Each time you're critically hit while wearing the etched armor, attempt a `DC 14 Flat check`. On a success, it becomes a normal hit. This property thickens the armor, increasing its Bulk by 1 and the Strength required to reduce its penalties by 1.
