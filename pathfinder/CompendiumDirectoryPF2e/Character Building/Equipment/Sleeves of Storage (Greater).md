# Sleeves of Storage (Greater)
## Item 9
### [[extradimensional]][[invested]][[magical]]


**Price** 600 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** worngarment

This loose robe has wide, voluminous sleeves that each contain an extradimensional space. These spaces each function as a [[Equipment/Spacious Pouch (Type I)|Spacious Pouch (Type I)]] that can hold up to 20 Bulk of items (for a total of 40 Bulk), though no individual item can be of more than 1 Bulk; the sleeves grow slightly heavy as you reach maximum capacity. You can add or remove an item from a sleeve with a single hand free as an Interact action.

If a sleeve is completely empty, you can place your own familiar into that extradimensional space. It can survive comfortably in your sleeve for up to 4 hours, after which it begins to _suffocate_. While in your sleeve, it can't be affected or targeted by any effects, but you don't benefit from any master abilities. A familiar can exit the sleeve of its own volition with a single action that has the _manipulate_ and _move_ traits. You can't place any other creature into your sleeves, nor can you place your familiar in a sleeve if it's larger than Tiny. If your familiar is in your sleeve, you can't place any items in the sleeve.
