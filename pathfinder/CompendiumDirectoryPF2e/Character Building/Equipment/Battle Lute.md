This reinforced lute is suitable both for use as a handheld musical instrument and for bashing heads should a crowd turn sour. Its strings are finely braided wires that run along its sturdy metal neck. A battle lute adds its item bonus from weapon potency runes (if any) as an item bonus on Performance checks made while using it as an instrument.
