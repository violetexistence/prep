# Fire-Douse Snare
## Item 4
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[consumable]][[mechanical]][[snare]][[trap]]

**Category** snare; 
**Price** 15 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

You carefully pack rare, heat-absorbing powders into a specially prepared clay vessel, then bury the vessel in the ground up to its neck. When a creature enters the square, the vessel's neck shatters, dispersing the powders into the air. The powder instantly douses non-magical fires the size of a campfire or smaller within 10 feet of the snare. The creature triggering the snare must attempt a `DC 20 Reflex check` save to avoid getting powder in its face. A creature [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] or [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] by the powder can use an Interact action to attempt a `DC 10 Flat check` check; on a success, it removes the condition. On a failure, it can try again, with a `DC 5 Flat check` check on the next Interact check. If it fails a second time, it automatically removes the condition with a third Interact action.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature is dazzled for 1 round.

**Failure** The creature is blinded until the end of its next turn and dazzled for 1 minute afterwards.

**Critical Failure** The creature is blinded for 1 minute and dazzled for 10 minutes afterwards.
