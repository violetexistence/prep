# Unholy Plate
## Item 13
### [[bulwark]][[divine]][[invested]][[unholy]]

**Category** heavy; **Group** plate
**Price** 2500 gp; 
**Bulk** 4; **Size** med
**Usage** wornarmor

Crafted from black iron, this crude suit of _+2 resilient full plate_ is designed to make you look like a horned demon with your face peering out of the screaming maw of the beast.

While wearing the armor, you can attack with the helmet's horns. They're a martial melee weapon with the effects of a +2 weapon potency rune. They deal 2d8 piercing damage and have the deadly d12 and unholy traits. On a critical hit with the horns, the target must succeed at a `DC 30 Fortitude check` or become [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]] (or [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 2]] on a critical failure). The horns can't be etched with any runes.

If you're holy, you're [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 2]] and can't recover from this condition while wearing unholy plate.
