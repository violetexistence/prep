The spikes of this _+2 greater striking standard-grade adamantine morningstar_ have a faintly green shimmer, as if resembling Ayrzul's crystalline teeth. The weapon vibrates briefly when first drawn in or carried into a radioactive area, with the intensity of the vibration correlating to the radioactivity's strength. While you carry Boughshatter, you gain a +4 status bonus to saving throws against radiation, including Ayrzul's Blight.

* * *

**Activate—Splintering Strike** `pf2:2` (manipulate)

**Frequency** Once per minute

* * *

**Effect** Make a Strike with the morningstar that deals an extra die of weapon damage. If you make this Strike against a fungus, plant, or creature with the wood trait, the Strike ignores 10 points of the target's resistances to bludgeoning and piercing damage, if any. By damaging such a creature, the morningstar causes the target's flesh to explode in a shower of splinters that affect a 30-foot cone originating from the target's space, dealing 8d6 piercing damage to creatures in the area (`DC 30 Reflex check` save). You and the target are unaffected by these splinters.

* * *

**Activate—Absorb Corruption** `pf2:r` (concentrate)

**Frequency** Once per day

**Trigger** You take poison or void damage;

* * *

**Effect** You channel some of the toxic energy into Boughshatter, granting the weapon the effects of either a [[Equipment/Decaying|Decaying]] weapon rune, [[Equipment/Grievous|Grievous]] weapon rune, or [[Equipment/Wounding|Wounding]] weapon rune for 1 minute. While under this effect, the morningstar glows with dim green light in a 20-foot radius.
