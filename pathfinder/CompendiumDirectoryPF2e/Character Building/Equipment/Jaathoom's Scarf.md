# Jaathoom's Scarf
## Item 10
### [[air]][[invested]][[magical]]


**Price** 900 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** wornbelt

This scarf is made of fine silk that's the same shade of blue as a clear, cloudless sky. The short ends are edged with a fine gold fringe that seems to sway even in still weather as though touched by invisible winds. The long edges have exquisite embroidery in threads that vary from a blue identical to the silk to the deep gray of storm clouds during winter. Wearing this scarf grants a +2 item bonus to Performance checks to dance and to Acrobatics checks to [[Actions/Escape|Escape]].

**Activate—Vanish** `pf2:2` (concentrate)

**Activate—Jaathoom's Rebuke** `pf2:1` (concentrate)

**Frequency** once per hour

**Effect** You let the winds around you catch the edges of the _jaathoom's scarf_, and a jaathoom shuyookh appears with a sudden updraft. The winds force your enemies back, granting you some breathing room in battle. Each enemy in a 10-foot emanation must succeed at a `DC 27 Fortitude check` save or be pushed 10 feet. A creature that critically fails is also knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] after being moved. Creatures with the air trait are immune to all these effects.
