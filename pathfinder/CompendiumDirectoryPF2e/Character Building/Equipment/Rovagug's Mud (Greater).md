Rovagug's mud smells and tastes like wet, sour earth. For 1 hour after you drink it, you have a +2 item bonus to saving throws against incapacitation effects. Also, you can use a single action to breathe out a 20-foot cone of bitter vapor that causes an earth-shaking rumble that can be heard for 100 feet. Creatures and objects in the area take 8d6 untyped damage (`DC 38 Fortitude check`), decreasing Hardness by 10. An object's Hardness remains lowered for 1d4 rounds, and you can't use this breath again for the same amount of time.
