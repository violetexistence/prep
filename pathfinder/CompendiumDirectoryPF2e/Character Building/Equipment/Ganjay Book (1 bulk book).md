# Ganjay Book (1 bulk book)
## Item 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")


**Price** 10 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

This item is a formula book, religious text, or spellbook that has been creased-possibly by Princess Ganjay herself-to fold up into an impossibly small shape. When folded up, the book can't be read or used, but its Bulk is reduced by 1 (a book that is 1 Bulk becomes light Bulk, and a book that is light Bulk becomes negligible in weight).

**Activate** 1 minute (Interact) You fold or unfold the Ganjay book, manipulating the cunning creases.
