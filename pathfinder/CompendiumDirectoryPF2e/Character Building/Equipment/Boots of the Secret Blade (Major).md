# Boots of the Secret Blade (Major)
## Item 15
### [[invested]][[magical]]


**Price** 5500 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** wornshoes

You pride yourself on being well prepared with weaponry for any situation. Your dark-gray boots might appear mundane, but you know that they can conjure a blade at any moment. Even the most thorough of searches can't find a knife that doesn't exist yet.

**Activateâ€”Draw Secret Blade** `pf2:1` (manipulate)

**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

**Effect** You reach down to your boot, draw a _+2 greater striking dagger_ from it, and make a ranged or melee Strike with it. This dagger is created magically and does not exist before being drawn. The dagger remains a physical object until the next time you use Draw Secret Blade, and it disappears as a new blade is created.
