# Misdirecting Haversack
## Item 6
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[illusion]][[magical]]


**Price** 200 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** worn

This brown leather satchel is made from a heavily oiled and rustic leather. The satchel is large enough to hold up to 1 Bulk worth of items.

* * *

**Activate** 1 minute (envision, Interact)

* * *

**Effect** Documents inside the haversack become magically disguised as documents of a similar type but with misleading information. Anyone inspecting a document notices the disguise with a successful `DC 20 Perception check` check, but determining the actual text requires a successful `DC 20 Society check` check to Decipher Writing. This lasts until you use this activation again, which ends the effect for all previously disguised documents; until you use the second activation to end the effect for a single document; or until a document in the haversack remains outside the haversack for at least 1 hour, ending the effect for that document.

* * *

**Activate** `pf2:1` command

* * *

**Effect** You revert one of the documents back to its original state.
