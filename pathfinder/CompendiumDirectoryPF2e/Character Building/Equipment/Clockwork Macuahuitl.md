This finely-made wooden club has a beautiful, lacquered finish that gleams in the sunlight. A heavy ring of gears lined with sharpened pieces of obsidian automatically and constantly spin around the bulk of the wooden club lengthwise. Striking a foe digs the obsidian gears into the enemy's flesh and tears it with its blades. The ever-turning gears also help to dislodge an enemy's defensive position against the weapon.
