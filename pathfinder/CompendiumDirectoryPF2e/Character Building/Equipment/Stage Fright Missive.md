Composing a stage fright missive usually involves creating a scathing review, insulting letter, or embarrassing image that ridicules the recipient. The activating creature must succeed at a `DC 20 Will check` save or be overcome with embarrassment for 1 hour, taking a â€“1 status penalty to Deception, Diplomacy, Intimidation, and Performance checks. During this time, if the creature attempts to speak or perform in front of an audience, they become [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]]. When they recover from this sickened condition, the missive's effects end. You choose when composing the missive whether it remains as a non-magical document or burns to ash after imparting its magic.
