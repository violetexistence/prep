**Price** 1900 gp; 
**Bulk** 1; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

A _bullhook_ is a stout rod about 4 feet long with a blunt hook on the end. Too dull to be useful as a weapon, a _bullhook_ is instead used to direct animals in training or in performing their tasks. A _bullhook_ grants you a +2 item bonus to Nature checks to Command an Animal while you are holding it.

**Activate** `pf2:2` command, Interact

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You wave the _bullhook_ to produce the effects of a fifth level [[Spells/Command|Command]] spell (DC 30). This spell loses the linguistic trait and can target only animals.

**Craft Requirements** Supply a casting of _command_ of the appropriate rank.
