# Rhythm Bone (Greater)
## Item 4
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[auditory]][[magical]]


**Price** 64 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

This small, enchanted bone (most often a jaw) is usually capped with metal at its ends. It's activated by striking it against a hard surface.

* * *

**Activate** `pf2:1` Interact

**Effect** The bone begins recording the next 10 minutes of ambient sounds (including speech) that require a DC 20 or lower Perception check to hear. The bone's recording doesn't copy magical auditory effects, such as those of spellcasting, a harpy's song, or a banshee's wail. Once the rhythm bone has been activated in this way, it retains the recorded sound for the rest of its existence and can't be activated this way again.

* * *

**Activate** `pf2:1` Interact

**Effect** The bone replays its recorded sounds.

* * *

**Craft Requirements** Supply a casting of [[Spells/Ghost Sound|Ghost Sound]].
