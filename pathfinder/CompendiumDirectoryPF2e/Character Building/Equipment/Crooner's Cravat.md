This long, silky neckcloth has the ability to be tied into a convincing semblance of an elegant evening scarf, a worker's neck kerchief, an elaborate cravat, or any other neckwear. It also provides a boost to vocal performances, enhancing both projection and the emotive qualities of a performance. In its natural state, this item appears as a long, white silk scarf. A _crooner's cravat_ grants a +1 item bonus to all Performance checks, but this increases to a +2 item bonus for Performance checks to sing.
