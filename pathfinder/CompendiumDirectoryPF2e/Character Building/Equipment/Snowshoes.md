# Snowshoes

### 


**Price** 10 gp; 
**Bulk** 1; **Size** med
**Usage** wornshoes

These specialized pieces of footwear are designed to distribute the wearer's weight over a larger area to prevent them from sinking while walking on snow. They are typically made with a wood frame and rawhide lacings that are tied over the wearer's other footwear.

While wearing snowshoes, you ignore the effects of non-magical difficult terrain caused by snow (reducing greater difficult terrain from snow to ordinary difficult terrain).

You take a -10-foot item penalty to your Speed if wearing snowshoes while walking on any surface other than snow.
