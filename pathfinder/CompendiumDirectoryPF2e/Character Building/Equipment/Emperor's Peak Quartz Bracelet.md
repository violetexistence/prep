# Emperor's Peak Quartz Bracelet
## Item 3
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[invested]][[magical]]


**Price** 5 gp;

**Usage** worn

While most residents of—and travelers to—the Five Kings Mountains live underground, a significant number of people explore the regions' awe-inspiring peaks. Among their many discoveries on Emperor's Peak is a deposit of rainbow-colored rock crystal quartz with inherent magical properties that aid in survival, especially in the mountains. Dwarven artisans fashion chunks of this translucent quartz into fashionable bracelets.

Wearing such a bracelet grants you a +1 item bonus to Survival checks to [[Actions/Sense Direction|Sense Direction]] and [[Actions/Subsist|Subsist]]. This bonus increases to +3 when in mountainous terrain. If you attempt a Survival check to Subsist after 8 hours or less of exploration, you take only a –2 penalty instead of a –5 penalty.
