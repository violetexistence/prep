This _+2 greater striking grievous sawtooth saber_ has a red hilt and a purple-black blade. Favored by Red Mantis assassins who enjoy using illusions to confound their targets, a _crimson bluff_ constantly flickers and flashes, creating brief afterimages that can be quite distracting. If you use a _crimson bluff_ as part of a gesture when you [[Actions/Create a Diversion|Create a Diversion]], you gain a +2 item bonus to your Deception check.

**Requirements** You are under the effects of _blur_

**Trigger** An enemy would hit you with a melee Strike
