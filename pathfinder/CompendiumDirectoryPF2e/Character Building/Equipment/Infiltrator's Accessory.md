This elegant _+1 striking sword cane_ serves equally well as a fashionable accessory and hidden weapon suitable for high-society events where weapons aren't typically permitted.

**Activate-Hide Magic** `pf2:1` (manipulate)

**Effect** You twist the sword cane's hilt, magically merging the blade into the cane. While the blade is merged, it can't be drawn and gains the benefits of a 3rd-rank [[Spells/Disguise Magic|Disguise Magic]] spell to appear non-magical. Passive observers can't attempt a check to notice the cane is anything more than a mundane, if superb, fashion accessory. Those carefully examining it can discern the cane is more than it appears, but doing so is extremely difficult (`DC 30 Perception check`). Activating the sword cane again releases the blade, allowing it to be drawn normally.
