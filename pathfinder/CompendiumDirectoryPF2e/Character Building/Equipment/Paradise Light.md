### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[invested]][[light]][[magical]]


**Price** 1100 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

This crystal phial was created from Brilliance, a condensed planar fragment of the plane of Nirvana which is trapped within Gloaming Arbor. A _paradise light_ glows brightly, shedding bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light to a further 30 feet. A PC that looks into the _paradise light_ sees images of Nirvana, an idyllic pastoral paradise. A _paradise light_ is required to navigate the heart of the forest in Gloaming Arbor.

A _paradise light_ automatically attempts to counteract any magical darkness that it's light enters. When the _paradise light_ successfully counteracts an area of magical darkness, that area becomes overlain by a reflection of Nirvana, changing the appearance of the area. This illusory transformation lasts for 1 hour.

**Activateâ€”Sanctum** `pf2:2` (manipulate)

**Frequency** once per hour

**Effect** You conjure a shard of Nirvana in a 30 foot emanation, temporarily altering the landscape into an soothing meadow for 1 minute. Creatures in the area gain a +1 item bonus to Will saves and Wisdom-based skill checks, and have fast healing 2. A creature in the area that attempts to take a hostile action must succeed at a `DC 28 Will check` save or the hostile action is prevented and the actions they would've spent are wasted.
