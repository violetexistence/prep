This sinister suit of jet-black _+2 resilient full plate_ was designed to bolster the graveknights of Yled's undead armies, creating unstoppable legions.

If a graveknight wearing undamaged plate of Yled is destroyed, the armor rebuilds its body over the course of 1d10 rounds instead of 1d10 days. A living creature who dons the armor is affected by the graveknight's curse immediately instead of 1 hour.
