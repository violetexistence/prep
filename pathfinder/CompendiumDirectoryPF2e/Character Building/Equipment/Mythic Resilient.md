# Mythic Resilient
## Item 20
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[magical]][[mythic]]


**Price** 70000 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** etched-onto-armor

_Mythic resilient_ runes imbue armor with unrivaled protection from a wide array of effects. The armor grants a +4 item bonus to saving throws to the wearer.

**Activateâ€”Defy Obliteration** `pf2:r` (concentration)

**Trigger** You critically fail a saving throw

**Effect** Spend a Mythic Point; if the triggering save was made due to an effect created by a mythic monster, hazard, or other effect, it's a normal failure instead. If the save was made due to an effect that wasn't mythic, it becomes a success.

* * *

**Craft Requirements** _Mythic resilient_ runes can only be crafted, etched, or transferred by a mythic character capable of making a Crafting check at mythic proficiency (such as by having the Artisan's Calling).
