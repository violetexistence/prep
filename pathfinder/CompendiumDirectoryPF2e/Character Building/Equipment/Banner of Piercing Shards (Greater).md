This magical banner has an intricately embroidered pattern of shards and cracks across its surface, almost like a broken mirror. Though it always feels dry to the touch, this banner from a distance gleams red as if slightly stained with the blood of your enemies. While holding a banner of piercing shards, you can use the following ability.

**Activateâ€”Shards Seek Wounds** `pf2:1` (concentrate)

**Frequency** once per minute

* * *

**Effect** Shards of sharpened glass violently shoot out from the magical banner into the newly opened wounds of a nearby enemy. The magical banner deals 2d4 persistent bleed damage to any enemy within the banner's aura that has been dealt damage since the end of your last turn.
