Flare beacons create an incredibly bright light for a brief period of time. They are often used to signal others to the beacon's location, to coordinate assaults, to request rescue, or for other similar reasons. Higher-level beacons have a radius so large that they can be seen from miles away at night. When you Activate a flare beacon, you can either place it on the ground in a space within your reach or toss it up to 60 feet straight up. The beacon then sparks into being, casting bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light in the next 20 feet for 1 minute. A flare beacon in the air falls at a rate of 10 feet per round. Creatures adjacent to a flare beacon must succeed at a `DC 15 Fortitude check` save or be [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] until they are no longer adjacent to it.
