Shiny gray metal that slightly thrums when touched makes up the metal parts of a magnetic shot. When activated, the shot is more effective against a target wearing metal armor or made of metal. The activated ammunition grants a +2 circumstance bonus to attack rolls against such targets. Due to magnetic acceleration, the ammunition deals four additional weapon damage dice and is deadly d12.
