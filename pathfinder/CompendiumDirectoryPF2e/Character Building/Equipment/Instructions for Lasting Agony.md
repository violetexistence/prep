**Effect** If your next action is to cast a harmful necromancy spell that you prepared from this grimoire and that allows a saving throw, you warp and twist void energy into the spell to cause intense pain. If the target fails its saving throw against the spell, it becomes [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] by the pain.
