Shaped like an open-palmed hand, this small sculpture of smooth sandstone seems to blunt a weapon when applied rather than sharpen it. For 1 minute, a weapon to which a _hand of mercy_ is applied gains the nonlethal trait and can't be used to make lethal attacks. Any persistent damage the weapon would deal is negated.
