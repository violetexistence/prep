This _+1 striking bo staff_ is covered in scales shed by or harvested from a dragon. When benefiting from the circumstance bonus to AC granted by the bo staff's parry trait, you also gain resistance 5 to acid, cold, electricity, fire, or poison, according to the type of damage dealt by the breath weapon of the dragon that provided the scales; for instance, a staff made with scales taken from a white dragon would provide cold resistance. When this resistance prevents you from taking damage, the _dragonscale staff_ deals an additional 1 damage of the type matching its resistance for 1 round.

**Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials must include scales from a dragon with a breath weapon that deals acid, cold, electricity, fire, or poison damage.
