# Tracking Tag

### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")


**Price** 1 sp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** affixed-to-a-creature

Small and unobtrusive tags made from a durable material, often leather or hardwood, tracking tags are attached to wild animals, usually by a collar, to track their movements. They also serve as a way to let others know that someone is keeping track of this animal. Each tag is also inscribed with a unique label so individual creatures can be more easily identified among a herd.
