When this pebble hits a creature or a hard surface, it explodes with a deafening bang. A blasting stone deals 3d4 sonic damage and 3 sonic splash damage, and each creature within 10 feet of the space in which the stone exploded must succeed at a `DC 28 Fortitude check` saving throw with the listed DC or be [[Conditions/Deafened|Deafened]] until the end of its next turn. You gain a +2 item bonus to attack rolls.
