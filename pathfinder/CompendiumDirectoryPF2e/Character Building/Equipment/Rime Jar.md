# Rime Jar
## Item 10
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[magical]]


**Price** 175 gp; 
**Bulk** 1; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-two-hands

Magical reagents slosh inside this rime-frosted pottery jar the size of a human head. Despite appearing to be rimed in hoarfrost, the jar is warm to the touch. Ilverani wizards create _rime jars_ to sustain themselves during the coldest winter nights.

**Effect** The jar draws off the cold and warms your body. If you have the [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]] condition caused by exposure to environmental cold, it removes the condition. For 8 hours after applying the rime, you treat extreme cold as severe cold.
