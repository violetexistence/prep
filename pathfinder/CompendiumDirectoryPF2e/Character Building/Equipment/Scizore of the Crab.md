A _scizore of the crab_ is a _+1 scizore_ that has the grapple trait in addition to its normal weapon traits.

**Activate** `pf2:1` (manipulate)

**Requirements** Your last action was a successful Strike with this weapon, or you have a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] with this weapon

**Effect** The target is grabbed until the end of your next turn. A grabbed creature can use the [[Actions/Escape|Escape]] action to get out of the Grab, and the Grab ends for a grabbed creature if you move away from it. This functions as the Grab creature ability.

**Activate** `pf2:1` (manipulate)

**Frequency** once per round

**Requirements** You have a creature grabbed with this weapon

* * *

**Effect** The crab claw animates and pinches open and shut, dealing slashing damage equal to the _scizore of the crab_'s number of damage dice.

**Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials must include a claw from a giant crab or similar creature.
