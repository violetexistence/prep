Antiplague can fortify the body's defenses against diseases. Upon drinking an antiplague, you gain a +4 item bonus to Fortitude saving throws against diseases for 24 hours; this applies to your daily save against a disease's progression.

When you drink the antiplague, you can immediately attempt a saving throw against one disease of 14th level or lower affecting you. If you succeed, you are cured of the disease.
