Made from the ground bones of ghouls or other cannibalistic creatures processed into a green-gray paste, gnawbone toxin imparts an insatiable desire to consume the flesh of intelligent creatures. If the victim eats at least a mouthful of humanoid flesh, it ignores the enfeebled condition from gnawbone toxin for 1 minute. Victims under the effect of gnawbone toxin regain only half as many Hit Points from healing effects unless they've eaten at least a mouthful of humanoid flesh in the last minute.

**Saving Throw** `DC 30 Fortitude check`

**Onset** 1 minute

**Maximum Duration** 6 minutes

**Stage 1** [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 2]] (1 minute)
