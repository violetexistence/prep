The spores of a certain mushrooms, if carefully collected and suspended in a properly mixed alchemical fluid, can kill those near death.

If a creature dies from execution powder, the spores from their last breath alight on a random creature adjacent to the victim, granting that creature 20 temporary Hit Points and a +1 status bonus to attack and damage rolls for 10 minutes.
