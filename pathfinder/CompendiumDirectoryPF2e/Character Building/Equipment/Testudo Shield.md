This tower shield (Hardness 5, HP 20, BT 10) sports a bright red front with a gold inlay of an eagle. While it looks unassuming, this shield can protect not only yourself but also those behind you.

**Effect** Your shield creates a magical barrier, consisting of translucent copies of the shield. The wall is 1 inch thick, 15 feet long, and 10 feet high. The barrier is conjured adjacent to you in a straight line on the border between squares and lasts for 1 minute. The barrier is created with the Hardness and Hit Points equal to those of the testudo shield and is immune to critical hits and precision damage.
