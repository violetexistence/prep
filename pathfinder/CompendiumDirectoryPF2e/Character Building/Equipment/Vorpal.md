# Vorpal
## Item 17
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[magical]]


**Price** 15000 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** etched-onto-slashing-melee-weapon

Originally created as a means of slaying the legendary jabberwock, _vorpal_ weapons prove equally effective against nearly any foe with a head.

* * *

**Activateâ€”Snicker-Snack** `pf2:r` (concentrate, death, incapacitation)

**Trigger** You roll a natural 20 on a Strike with the weapon against a creature that has a head, critically succeed, and deal slashing damage.

**Effect** The target must succeed at a `DC 37 Fortitude check` save or be decapitated. This kills any creature except ones that don't require a head to live. For creatures with multiple heads, this usually kills the creature only if you sever its last head.
