# Greengut
## Item 17
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[alchemical]][[consumable]][[poison]]

**Category** poison; 
**Price** 2500 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

This watery, mint-green emetic of xulgath design is often carried in a delicate obsidian vial or other fragile container.

In the unfortunate circumstance that a creature has been Swallowed Whole by another creature, the swallowed creature can break open a vial of greengut to immediately induce vomiting.

**Activate** `pf2:1` Interact

The swallower must succeed at a `DC 40 Fortitude check` save or take 18d6 poison damage and possibly vomit the contents of its stomach.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature takes half damage.

**Failure** The creature takes full damage, is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]], and vomits up any and all creatures Swallowed Whole on its next turn (a single action, which also allows it a Fortitude save against the sickened condition), as well as any stones or other objects it swallowed.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature takes double damage and is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]].
