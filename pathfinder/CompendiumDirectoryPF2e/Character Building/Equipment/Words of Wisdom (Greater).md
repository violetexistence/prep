# Words of Wisdom (Greater)
## Item 18
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[invested]][[magical]][[tattoo]]


**Price** 22000 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** tattooed-on-the-body

Yrisette developed these unique tattoos after months of tinkering and experimentation. This tattoo is always of a saying that has meaning to the person who wears it. While the words are [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] within a larger pattern and are nearly impossible to discern at a glance, they lend gravitas and power to the wearer's words. When the tattoo is applied, choose whether the phrase is of threatening words (Intimidation), persuasive words (Deception), or dramatic words (Performance).

**Activate** `pf2:1` Command

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You speak your meaningful phrase from your tattoo out loud, emboldening your words for 1 hour. During this time, you gain a +3 item bonus to Diplomacy checks and checks of the skill associated with your phrase. When you roll a critical failure on a Diplomacy check or the associated skill during this time, you get a failure instead.
