# Baton of the Fallen
## Item 16
### [[magical]]


**Price** 9000 gp; 
**Bulk** 1; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

This pale shaft of wood has skulls and the mournful faces of the dead carved into its surface. Cold to the touch, it brings a slight chill to the air and smells of freshly disturbed earth.

* * *

**Activateâ€”Gather the Fallen** `pf2:3` (manipulate, occult, void)

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You plant the baton into the ground, the soil softly parting to allow it to be solidly seated. Doing so summons a cloud of ghostly spirits in a 30-foot burst. All creatures within the cloud become [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]], and all creatures outside the cloud become concealed to creatures within it. The spirits deal 8d6 void damage to each creature who enters or begins their turn in the cloud (`DC 35 Fortitude check`). You are unaffected by the cloud. This effect lasts 1 minute or ends if an adjacent creature spends an Interact action to knock the baton over.
