This piece of silver or gold jewelry is adorned with miniature images of kite shields and can be used to fasten a cloak or cape.

The brooch automatically absorbs magic missile spells targeting you. A brooch of shielding can absorb 30 individual magic missiles before it melts and becomes useless. Sometimes when found, a brooch of shielding has already absorbed a number of missiles.
