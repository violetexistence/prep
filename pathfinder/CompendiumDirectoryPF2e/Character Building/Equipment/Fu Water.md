# Fu Water
## Item 5
### [[consumable]][[divine]][[potion]][[splash]]

**Category** potion; 
**Price** 21 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

Burnt fulu ashes float in this liquid, lending a distinctive red color and imparting it with a variety of purifying effects. Unlike many fulu items, fu water must be created using divine magic.

**Activate** `pf2:1` Interact

**Effect** This potion functions as a bottle of holy water. Like holy water, you throw it as a Strike. It's a simple thrown weapon with a range increment of 20 feet. Unlike an alchemical bomb, it doesn't add the manipulate trait to the attack made with it.

**Activate** `pf2:1` Interact

* * *

**Effect** You drink the fu water to counteract ailments within yourself. Attempt a counteract check with a +9 counteract modifier and a counteract rank of 3 against one effect that imposes the [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]], [[Conditions/Fascinated|Fascinated]], [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened]], or [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied]] condition. You are then [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]].
