This long, fire-red feather smolders from the weapon it adorns. When you activate the feather, the creature you damaged burns with sacred light. The creature must succeed at a `DC 29 Will check` save or take a â€“2 status penalty to AC and saving throws and reduce its resistances by 5. These effects last until the end of your next turn. This item has no effect on a creature with the holy trait.
