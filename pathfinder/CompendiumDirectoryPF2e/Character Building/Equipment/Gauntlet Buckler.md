# Gauntlet Buckler

### [[foldaway]]


**Price** 5 gp; 
**Bulk** 1; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

This buckler-sized shield is segmented, allowing it to collapse into a housing bound to a gauntlet for easy storage. A small catch enables you to expand the shield quickly in battle when you're in need of defense.
