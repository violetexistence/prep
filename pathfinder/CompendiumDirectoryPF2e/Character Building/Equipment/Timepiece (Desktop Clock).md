# Timepiece (Desktop Clock)
## Item 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[clockwork]]


**Price** 10 gp; 
**Bulk** 3; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

Clockwork timepieces come in a variety of sizes and aesthetic styles, but they're all designed to display the accurate time of day down to the second.

Clockwork timepieces have a 24-hour activation cycle, after which they must wound in a process that takes 1 minute to complete.

Desktop clocks have been designed to be small enough to only take up a quarter of a typical writing desk's surface area, but they're still too bulky and heavy to be lugged around casually.
