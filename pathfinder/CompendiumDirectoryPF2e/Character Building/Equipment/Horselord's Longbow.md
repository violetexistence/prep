These _+1 striking longbows_, usually decorated with intricate animal carvings and hawk feathers, are a favored weapon among the mounted warriors of the Shriikirri-Quah clan in north-central Varisia, although Shoanti travel widely enough that they find frequent use by cavalries of other nations and cultures as well. While you are mounted, Strikes with this bow gain a +2 circumstance bonus to damage against unmounted creatures who are smaller than your mount.
