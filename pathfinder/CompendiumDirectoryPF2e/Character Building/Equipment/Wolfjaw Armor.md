Barbarians, druids and other outlanders are often forced to spend the harsh winter months protecting their communities from one of the deadliest predators to stalk the forests and taiga of the northern reaches, the fearsome witchwarg. This _+1 hide armor_ is assembled from the hide and fur of a trio of witchwargs, and it conveys on the wearer both an attack akin to the witchwargs' deadly jaws and the ability to channel the frigid cold of the witchwarg's Winter Breath.
