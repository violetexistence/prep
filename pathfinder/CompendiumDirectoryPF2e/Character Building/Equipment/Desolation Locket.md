# Desolation Locket
## Item 8
### [[magical]][[spellheart]]


**Price** 470 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** affixed-to-armor-or-a-weapon

The surface of this golden, heart-shaped locket is nearly worn through with cracks. If opened, it reveals a portrait of someone the bearer loved dearly and has lost. The spell DC of any spell cast by activating this item is 24.

*   **Armor** The _desolation locket_ numbs you to further despair, and you gain a +2 item bonus to saving throws against emotion effects.
*   **Weapon** (emotion, mental) After you cast a non-cantrip spell by activating the _locket_, you emanate an aura of hopelessness in a 5-foot emanation until the start of your next turn. A creature that ends its turn in the aura must succeed at a `DC 24 Will check` saving throw against the locket's spell DC or become [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] ([[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 2]] on a critical failure) until the end of its next turn.
