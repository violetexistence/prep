# Corrosive Engravings
## Item 5
### [[acid]][[grimoire]][[magical]]


**Price** 140 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

These tin sheets are bound in brass and show significant signs of erosion. The grimoire's title is acid-etched, and flipping between the sheets leaves your fingers covered in flecks of rust and powdery metal.

**Activate** `pf2:0` (concentrate)

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** If your next action is to cast an acid or poison spell that deals persistent damage, any creature who takes persistent damage from the spell is also [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]] until the persistent damage ends. Using an action to retch can reduce the sickened value as normal, but it can't reduce the sickened value below 1 until the persistent damage ends.
