# Bomb Launcher
## Item 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")


**Price** 20 gp; 
**Bulk** 1; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-two-hands

This long, hollow tube is held in two hands and braced over the shoulder. Inside, it contains a small metal basket sized to hold alchemical bombs. A chute in the top delivers an alchemical bomb into the internal basket, while a lever on the underside pulls the basket back and locks it in place. Loading an alchemical bomb into a bomb launcher requires a single Interact action. With a pull of a trigger, the basket speeds forward, allowing you to Strike with the loaded alchemical bomb over long distances. Bombs fired with a bomb launcher have a range increment of 60 feet.
