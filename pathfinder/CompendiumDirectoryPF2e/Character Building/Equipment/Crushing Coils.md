# Crushing Coils
## Item 5
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[cursed]][[invested]][[magical]]

**Category** light; **Group** leather
**Price** 0 gp; 
**Bulk** 1; **Size** med
**Usage** wornarmor

Made from constrictor snakeskin, the strips of this _+1 leather armor_ wrap around you like an anaconda might wrap around its victim. The first time you roll a 1 on any attack roll or check after donning the armor, it fuses with you and constricts. It constricts anytime you roll a 1 on any attack roll or check thereafter. When the armor constricts, you're [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]] for 1 round.

**Activate** `pf2:1` (concentrate, manipulate)

* * *

**Effect** The armor wraps around you, allowing you to don it by the time the activation finishes.
