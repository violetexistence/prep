# Needle of Undeath
## Item 10
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[magical]]


**Price** 1150 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

This thin, wand-like implement is carved from bone and scrimshawed with depictions of battle. While holding the _needle of undeath_, mindless undead creatures see you as one of their own and are indifferent to you until you take hostile actions against them, and you have a +2 item bonus to Deception and Diplomacy checks against intelligent undead. This does not affect a summoned undead's attitude.

**Activateâ€”Speak with Undead** `pf2:1`

**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

**Effect** You can use Diplomacy to [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] on mindless undead or make simple requests of them with a +2 item bonus. You cannot make this request of someone else's summoned undead.
