This portable silver anvil has a narrow hoop on one end, through which a long, sturdy chain has been strung. Torag's Silver Anvil can be wielded as a +3 [[Equipment/Holy|Holy]] [[Equipment/Flaming (Greater)|Greater Flaming]] greater striking silver meteor hammer.

Outside of combat, the anvil can be used with a hammer as an incredibly effective portable forge, heating up the metal to be forged without a furnace and granting a +3 item bonus to Crafting checks involving metalworking.

When you use the anvil to successfully Repair a metal item, the item recovers an additional 10 Hit Points (or an additional 20 on a critical success).
