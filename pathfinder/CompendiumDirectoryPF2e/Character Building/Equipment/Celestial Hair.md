# Celestial Hair
## Item 20
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[consumable]][[magical]][[talisman]]

**Category** talisman; 
**Price** 12500 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** affixed-to-armor

**Usage** affixed to armor

**Activate** `pf2:0` Interact

**Trigger** You critically fail a saving throw or are critically hit by an attack

This strand of hair shimmers like the strands of fate. When you activate the string, it resonates with a single, perfect note.

The triggering saving throw becomes a failure or the triggering attack roll becomes a regular hit, not critical one. If the source of the attack or effect is an evil creature, that creature must succeed at a `DC 41 Will check` saving throw or be [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 2]] and [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] until the end of its next turn.
