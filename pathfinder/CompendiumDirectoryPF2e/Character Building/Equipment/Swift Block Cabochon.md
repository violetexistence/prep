This clear quartz cabochon attaches to the center of your shield. When you activate the cabochon, use the [[Feats/Shield Block|Shield Block]] reaction even if you don't have the shield raised and even if you don't normally have that reaction. Increase the shield's Hardness by 5 against the triggering attack. The shield remains raised after the block.
