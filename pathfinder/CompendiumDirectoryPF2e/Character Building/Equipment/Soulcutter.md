This _+2 greater striking astral elven curve blade_ was the treasured weapon of the Calistrian witch Silisifex, who played several key roles in reclaiming Kyonin from Tanglebriar when the elves returned to Golarion. Although a witch, her mesmerizing skill with the curved blade rivaled that of many soldiers. Her reasons for leaving _Soulcutter_ behind in Kyonin before her final mission into Tanglebriar in an attempt to purify Deathstalk Tower are unknown.

As long as you carry _Soulcutter_, you gain its potency bonus as an item bonus to all saving throws against mental effects. This bonus increases by 2 against possession effects.

Living creatures that start their turn in the area regain 1d8 Hit Points, and any fiend or undead creature that starts its turn in the area takes 1d8 spirit damage.
