# Hydra Mutagen
## Item 13
### [[alchemical]][[consumable]][[mutagen]][[polymorph]]

**Category** mutagen; 
**Price** 600 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

**Activate** `pf2:1` (manipulate)

* * *

You sprout a second head, increasing your awareness, intuition, and cognitive ability but also causing your physical capabilities to be impaired as both minds struggle to control a single body.

**Benefit** For 10 minutes, you gain all-around vision and a +3 item bonus to all Intelligence- and Wisdom-based skill checks. Once during the mutagen's effect, if you fail or critically fail a Will saving throw against a mental effect, you can treat the result as one degree of success better.

**Drawback** You are [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] for 10 minutes.
