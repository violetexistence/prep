This plain wooden bead dangles from a string attached to the stock of the affixed weapon. When you activate the bead, its magic greatly lessens the effect of distance on your triggering attack.

You take no range increment penalty on your attack, as long as the attack is against a target within the affixed weapon's first two range increments.
