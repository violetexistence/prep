## Item 1
### [[alchemical]][[consumable]][[elixir]][[mutagen]][[polymorph]]

**Category** mutagen; 
**Price** 4 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

* * *

Your features become striking, and your voice becomes musical and commanding, though emotion clouds your reason.

**Benefit** You gain a +1 item bonus to Deception, Diplomacy, Intimidation and Performance checks. Your critical failures with any of these skills become failures instead.

**Drawback** You take a -2 item penalty to Arcana, Crafting, Lore, Occultism, and Society checks. Choose one skill in which you are trained; for the duration, you become untrained in that skill. All your failures to [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] become critical failures.

**Duration** 1 minute.
