# Alcohol

### [[alchemical]][[consumable]][[drug]][[ingested]][[poison]]

**Category** drug; 
**Price** 1 cp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

Alcohol is a common substance available in stunning variety. The Price of a dose of alcohol depends on the specific beverage. You can't recover from the sickened condition from alcohol while affected.

If you fail a saving throw against alcohol other than initial saves, the affliction's stage doesn't increase; the only way to increase the stage of alcohol's affliction is to consume more alcohol.
