Laurisa Tromaine ordered these as prototype uniforms. The fur-lined pauldrons bear the insignia of a lion with a blade in its mouth. The type of blade indicates which bard school one graduated from. When you disguise the armor via its [[Equipment/Raiment|Raiment]] rune, you can choose whether to conceal this symbol or not. You can also use the rune's activation to quickly display or hide the insignia.

**Effect** You cast [[Spells/Message|Message]] at 1st rank to a target that you know is also wearing a _lion's pelt_ uniform. If you and the target share an insignia, the spell is heightened to 3rd rank.
