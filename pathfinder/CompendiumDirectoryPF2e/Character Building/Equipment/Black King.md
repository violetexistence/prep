The _black king_ is a _+2 greater striking ashen blunderbuss_. While the dark metal frame is still pleasant to look at, this design prioritizes destructive power over aesthetic appeal. This specialized blunderbuss has a scatter radius of 20 feet instead of 10, and all splash damage it deals is void damage instead of physical. Due to the risk of collateral damage, this weapon is typically only used by the especially foolhardy or reckless.
