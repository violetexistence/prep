# Blood Pack Squib
## Item 2
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[consumable]][[magical]]

**Category** other; 
**Price** 6 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

Used by theater troupes in combination with a fake blood pack, this bit of minor magic can simulate a dramatic and sudden wound. A _blood pack squib_ is a small unassuming stone that is keyed to a single fake blood pack in a process that takes 1 minute.

**Activateâ€”Burst Pack** `pf2:1` (manipulate)

**Requirements** The blood pack squib must be within 20 feet of its associated fake blood pack

* * *

**Effect** You lightly squeeze the stone and the fake blood pack dramatically bursts. The creature wearing the fake blood pack gains the benefits of a punctured fake blood pack. A single creature adjacent to the creature wearing the fake blood pack must succeed at a `DC 16 Reflex check` save or be splattered with the fake blood, becoming [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] until the end of their next turn. You can also activate the blood pack squib as a reaction when the fake blood pack is punctured normally.
