# Lost Ember
## Item 10
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[contract]][[invested]][[magical]]


**Price** 0 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** other

Sealed with a vial containing the ashes from your childhood home, you traded the memories of your early life to stay focused on the present, allowing you to avoid distractions during combat. Once per day, from any distance, the entity that holds your _bargained contract_ can take one of your memories. This functions as a casting of [[Spells/Rewrite Memory|Rewrite Memory]] that doesn't grant you a saving throw and can't be reversed by any means without stealing the memory back first.

**Activate** `pf2:0` command

**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** You start your turn [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] or [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]]

**Effect** A speck of ash from the vial sealing your _bargained contract_ appears out of nowhere on your tongue, bringing your senses into focus. You suppress the off-guard or confused condition until the start of your next turn. You can use this free action when you are confused, even though you normally can't take actions of your choice when confused.
