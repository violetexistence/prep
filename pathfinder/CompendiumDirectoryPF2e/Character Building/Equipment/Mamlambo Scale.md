**Effect** The _mamlambo scale_ sheds dim light in a 20-foot emanation. The light has a duration of 1 minute, but you can extinguish the light with an Interact action. A creature that begins its turn in the light must attempt a `DC 26 Will check` save. Regardless of the save's result, the creature is temporarily immune for 1 hour.
