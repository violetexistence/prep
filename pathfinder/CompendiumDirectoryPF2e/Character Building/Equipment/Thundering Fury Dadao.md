This massive, curved blade roars when it crashes down on opponents, seemingly intent on subduing them with sheer force. It's said materials for the first thundering fury dadaos came from the hide of Yorak, the Horned Thunder, a legendary kaiju that roams the Shanguang desert. The lack of embellishments on this _+2 striking thundering greatsword_ belies a weapon of deadly efficacy.
