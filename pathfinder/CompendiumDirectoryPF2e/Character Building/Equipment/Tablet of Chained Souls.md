# Tablet of Chained Souls
## Item 8
### [[cursed]][[magical]]


**Price** 0 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-two-hands

Half-formed, unreadable runes drift across this weathered stone tablet, which resembles a tombstone too eroded to be legible. Created by a long-dead order of scholars dedicated to Pharasma, the tablet of chained souls can be a powerful tool in laying uneasy spirits to rest, but its magic exacts a heavy cost.

**Effect** You present the tablet to a ghost, or lay it on a haunted site. The tablet's words resolve into a cryptic but accurate clue about the unfinished business that keeps this spirit from rest. Upon reading the tablet's words, you are subject to a [[Spells/Geas|Geas]] that requires you to right that wrong and lay the ghost to rest. If you die without completing the task, you become a ghost, cursed to remain until another recovers the tablet and discharges your duty.
