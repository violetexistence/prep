A scourge—also known as a cat-o'-nine-tails—is a set of several knotted cords made from cotton or leather and attached to a handle. While most scourges are more suitable for torture than combat, when fashioned into a weapon, a scourge can have metal barbs woven into the cords to pierce clothing and armor.
