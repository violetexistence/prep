For 1 hour you gain greatly increased blood production, filtering out contagions and boosting your endurance but causing your body to bloat with blood.

**Benefit** You gain a +3 item bonus to Fortitude and Reflex saves. This bonus improves to +4 when you attempt a save against an effect that has the disease trait, poison trait, or would give you the [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]] condition.

When you roll a success on a save against a disease, poison, or effect that would give you the Fatigued condition, you get a critical success instead.

**Drawback** Whenever you take piercing or slashing damage, you take 1d6 bleed.
