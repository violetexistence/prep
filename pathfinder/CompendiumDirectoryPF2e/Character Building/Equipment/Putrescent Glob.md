This repulsive, hairy glob dangles from the end of your weapon. When you activate the putrescent glob, the creature you damaged must succeed at a `DC 23 Fortitude check` save or its sickened condition increases to [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]], and it can't reduce its sickened condition until the end of its next turn. On a critical failure, it's also [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] until the end of its next turn.
