### [[illusion]][[invested]][[magical]][[tattoo]]


**Price** 60 gp;

**Usage** tattooed-on-the-body

These tattoos were first created using designs and techniques from the seven Shoanti clans. Each clan is known for one tattoo in particular. The clans would seal alliances in ancient days by tattooing their emblems on members of other clans to symbolically share their gifts. Though these tattoos are respected, the clans reserve their most prestigious symbols for true members of the clan. The tattoo allows you to understand and speak Shoanti. If you already know that language, you instead gain a +1 item bonus on Diplomacy checks you make when speaking Shoanti to someone who understands it.

The tattoo of the Skull clan depicts a broken maxilla and mandible.

**Activate** `pf2:2`

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** The tattoo casts [[Spells/Ventriloquism|Ventriloquism]].
