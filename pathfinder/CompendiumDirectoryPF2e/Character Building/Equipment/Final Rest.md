This _+3 [[Equipment/Vitalizing (Greater)|Vitalizing (Greater)]] greater striking silver longsword_ is made from the purest silver. The blade is carefully etched to depict a vast and sprawling necropolis, a place where the dead are laid to rest. Whenever you critically hit an undead creature with _final rest_, the undead creature takes 3d6 persistent spirit damage, with a `DC 36 Fortitude check`.

**Critical Success** No effect.

**Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]] and takes the full persistent spirit damage.

**Critical Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned]] and takes double the persistent spirit damage.
