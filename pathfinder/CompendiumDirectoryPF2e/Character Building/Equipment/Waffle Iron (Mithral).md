# Waffle Iron (Mithral)
## Item 8
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")


**Price** 355 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

This set of hinged metal plates features studs on the inside of each plate to provide a texture for the pastry cakes you cook with it. You pour batter on the plates, close the device, and place it on a fire or stove to cook.

The plates of this waffle iron are made of standard-grade dawnsilver rather than iron and might bear an imprint on the plates. As with other dawnsilver cookware, food rarely sticks to a dawnsilver waffle iron. As it's made of dawnsilver, this is an uncommon item.
