This dull red stone is shot through with glittering veins of black and silver. When you apply a _slayer's stone_ to your weapon, choose aberration, animal, beast, celestial, construct, dragon, elemental, fey, fiend, giant, monitor, ooze, or both fungus and plant. A weapon under the effect of a _slayer's stone_ deals an additional 1d6 precision damage to the creatures with the chosen trait or traits for 1 minute. It's up to the GM's discretion whether this benefit applies against a creature disguised as a creature with the chosen trait or traits.
