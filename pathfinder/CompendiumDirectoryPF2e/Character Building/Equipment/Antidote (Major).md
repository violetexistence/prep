An antidote protects you against toxins. Upon drinking an antidote, you gain a +4 item bonus to Fortitude saving throws against poisons for 6 hours, and when you drink the antidote, you can immediately attempt a saving throw against one poison of 14th level or lower affecting you. If you succeed, the poison is neutralized.
