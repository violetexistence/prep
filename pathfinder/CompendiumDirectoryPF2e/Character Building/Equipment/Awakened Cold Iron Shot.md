These bullets are formed from a liquefied high-grade precious metal and enchanted to unlock that metal's true potential.

The shot is a high-grade cold iron bullet. The awakened cold iron attempts to disrupt magic influences the target placed on others' minds. You can name a creature you believe to be enchanted by your target or allow the shot to choose an enchanted creature randomly. On a hit, the shot attempts to counteract the spell or effect the target is using to manipulate that creature's mind. The counteract rank is 9, and the counteract modifier is +27. If you fail (but don't critically fail) the counteract check against a demon or fey, you get a success instead. If you hit a demon or fey with no active spell effects on other creatures, the target is [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] for 1 minute instead.
