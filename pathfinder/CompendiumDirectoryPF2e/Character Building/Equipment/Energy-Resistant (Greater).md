# Energy-Resistant (Greater)
## Item 12
### [[magical]]


**Price** 1650 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** etched-onto-armor

These symbols convey protective forces from the Elemental Planes. You gain resistance 10 to acid, cold, electricity, or fire. The crafter chooses the damage type when creating the rune. Multiple _energy-resistant_ runes can be etched onto a suit of armor; rather than using only the strongest effect, each must provide resistance to a different damage type. For instance, a _+2 acid-resistant greater fire-resistant breastplate_ would give you acid resistance 5 and fire resistance 10.
