The appearance of this beautifully crafted _+2 disrupting greater striking lance_ changes to match the armor of its wielder. It has a cloth flag attached behind the lance point that displays whatever heraldry the wielder wishes.

If a cavalier with the [[Feats/Cavalier's Banner|Cavalier's Banner]] feat takes the _knight captain's lance_, it instead automatically displays the banner of their pledge.
