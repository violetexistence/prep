# Magnetic Shield
## Item 5
### [[alchemical]][[aura]]


**Price** 130 gp; 
**Bulk** 1; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

Copper rings spiral around this [[Equipment/Steel Shield|Steel Shield]]. Twin electrical probes near the grip can socket into a jar of moderate (or higher leveled) [[Equipment/Bottled Lightning (Lesser)|Bottled Lightning]], which takes 3 Interact actions to install.

**Activate** `pf2:1` (manipulate)

**Requirements** A _bottled lightning_ is installed in the shield

* * *

**Effect** The shield becomes an electromagnet for 3 rounds. When an activated magnetic shield is raised, the circumstance bonus increases by 1 against attacks made with weapons primarily made of metal. If you use a [[Feats/Shield Block|Shield Block]] against a creature attacking you with such a weapon, you also gain a +1 item bonus to [[Actions/Disarm|Disarm]] attempts against that weapon until the end of your next turn. The activation uses up the _bottled lightning_, and the shield can't be activated again until a new one is installed.
