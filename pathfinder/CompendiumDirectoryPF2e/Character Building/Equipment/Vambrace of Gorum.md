# Vambrace of Gorum
## Item 20
### [unique](unique "Unique Rarity Trait")[[artifact]][[divine]][[magical]]


**Price** 0 gp; 
**Bulk** 1; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

When the Lord in Iron shattered, immeasurable fragments fell to Golarion as pieces of metal. This piece of his armor has been shaped into the Vambrace of Gorum, a supreme reinforcing high-grade adamantine shield (Hardness 20, HP 160, BT 80). Pieces of sharp iron stick out, acting as +3 major striking shield spikes. The Vambrace still holds some of the deity's power. When the shield is broken, small fragments of metal explode outward, dealing 6d6 piercing damage in a 15-foot cone (`DC 40 Reflex check` save).

* * *

**Activate—Blade of Iron** `pf2:2` (concentrate, divine, manipulate)

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** The shield reforms into a +3 high-grade adamantine major striking greatsword for 1 minute. While wielding this sword, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC for each adjacent enemy (up to a +4 bonus).

* * *

**Activate—Blood of Iron** `pf2:1` (aura, divine)

**Frequency** once per day

**Requirements** The Vambrace of Gorum is in its shield form

**Effect** Your shield becomes an empowering symbol of the thrill of battle. You and your allies within 10 feet of you gain 30 temporary Hit Points that last for 1 hour, and reduce your clumsy, enfeebled, frightened, and stupefied conditions by 1.

* * *

**Activate—Bones of Iron** `pf2:r`

**Frequency** once per 10 minutes

**Trigger** You use the shield to Shield Block and the attack overcomes the shield's Hardness

**Effect** The iron spikes lash out at the creature who made the attack. The creature takes 6d6 piercing damage and 3d6 persistent bleed damage (`DC 40 Reflex check` save).

* * *

**Destruction** If the Vambrace of Gorum is broken, buried under a rose bush in Nirvana, and left undisturbed for 100 years, it loses all its magic and becomes a standard steel shield.
