**Price** 9500 gp;

**Usage** wornmask

The crime lord Miogimo almost always appears with this special mask, crafted with a piece of his soul.

It has two forms. In its first form, the mask depicts a silvery and angelic face; while wearing the mask in this form, your alignment appears as lawful good to creatures attempting to detect your alignment. In its second form, the mask depicts a gold-skinned demonic face; while wearing the mask in this form, your alignment appears as chaotic evil to creatures attempting to detect your alignment. If you die while wearing the mask, a fragment of your soul is trapped in the mask, forming a life link. If there was already a soul fragment in the mask when this happens, you roll a `Will check` save against the Will DC of the person who left the previous fragment. If you succeed, your soul fragment replaces the old one. On a failure, you die normally.
