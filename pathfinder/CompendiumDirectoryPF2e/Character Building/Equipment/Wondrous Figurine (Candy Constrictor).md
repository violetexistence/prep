# Wondrous Figurine (Candy Constrictor)
## Item 5
### [[magical]]


**Price** 140 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

Although appearing as a multicolored piece of stick candy, this figurine bears a narrow snake head at one end and is as durable as stone.

When activated, it becomes a rainbow-striped [[Monster Core/Python|Ball Python]] except it lacks the Stealth skill.

The snake can be used once per day, and it can remain in snake form for up to 20 minutes.
