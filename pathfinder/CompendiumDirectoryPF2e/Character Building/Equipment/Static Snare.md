# Static Snare
## Item 2
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[consumable]][[electricity]][[mechanical]][[snare]][[trap]]

**Category** snare; 
**Price** 6 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

You hide insulating crystals or other material that releases a strong static charge when the first creature enters the snare's square. That creature must attempt a `DC 18 Reflex check` saving throw.

**Success** The target is unaffected.

**Failure** The target takes 1 persistent electricity damage and takes a -1 circumstance penalty to saving throws against electricity effects for as long as the persistent electricity damage lasts.

[[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Static Snare|Effect: Static Snare]]

**Critical Failure** As failure, and the target attracts nearby dirt and dust. If the target is or becomes [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]], it's merely [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] to creatures that have sight as a precise sense. This effect lasts as long as the persistent electricity damage does.
