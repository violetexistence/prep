This plate of smoky glass is a variation on Dr. Krasovna Gerenevich's krasovnatype that is imprinted with void energies. Creating the plate requires a living thing to die as part of its electrical charging; most creators use insects or lab mice. The moritype creates an image in the same way as a krasovnatype, but also siphons off part of that aura. If used on a living creature, that creature must attempt a `DC 27 Will check` save.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** If the creature has any innate, prepared, or spontaneous spells, they're unable to Cast a Spell of their highest-ranked slot for 1 round. Cantrips and focus spells are unaffected.

**Failure** As success, except they can't cast the 2 highest ranks they have available.

**Critical Failure** As success, except they can't cast any spells other than cantrips and focus spells.
