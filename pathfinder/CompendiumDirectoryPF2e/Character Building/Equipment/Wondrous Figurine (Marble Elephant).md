# Wondrous Figurine (Marble Elephant)
## Item 13
### [[magical]]


**Price** 2700 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

Finely carved from a solid piece of marble, this gleaming elephant statuette becomes a fully grown [[Monster Core/Elephant|Elephant]] when activated.

The elephant can be called upon no more than four times per month. It remains for 24 hours as long as it is being used as a beast of burden or for transport.

If it attempts an attack or otherwise engages in combat, it reverts to statuette form after 1d4 rounds.
