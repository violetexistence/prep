# Climbing Kit (Extreme)
## Item 3
### 


**Price** 40 gp; 
**Bulk** 1; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-two-hands

This satchel includes 50 feet of rope, pulleys, a dozen pitons, a hammer, a grappling hook, and one set of crampons. Climbing kits allow you to attach yourself to the wall you're Climbing, moving half as quickly as usual (minimum 5 feet) but letting you attempt a `DC 5 Flat check` whenever you critically fail to prevent a fall.

You gain a +1 item bonus to Athletics checks to Climb while using an extreme climbing kit. A single kit has only enough materials for one climber; each climber needs their own kit. If you wear your climbing kit, you can access it as part of a Climb action.
