# Skarja's Heartstone
## Item 13
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[invested]][[occult]]


**Price** 2500 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** worn

This pale gemstone grants its wearer a +2 item bonus to saving throws and the ability to discern a target's alignment (as [[Spells/Detect Alignment|Detect Alignment]], but can detect chaotic, evil, good, and lawful auras simultaneously) at will by peering through the gemstone.

Like all hag _heartstones_, this gemstone is powered by Skarja's spirit. Skarja does not need to wear her _heartstone_ to benefit from its powers, but she cannot use them if she hasn't touched her _heartstone_ in the past 7 days. If Skarja's _heartstone_ is separated from her for more than 7 days (or if she's been dead for 7 days), it becomes a non-magical gemstone.

_**Note:** Item is worth 1000 gp when non-magical_

Skarja's _heartstone_ allows her to use additional occult innate spells: [[Spells/Ethereal Jaunt|Ethereal Jaunt]] (9th level) and [[Spells/Seize Soul|Seize Soul]] at will, [[Spells/Shadow Blast|Shadow Blast]] (6th level) twice per day, and [[Spells/Spirit Blast|Spirit Blast]] once per day.

* * *

**Activate** `pf2:1` command

**Requirements** You must be touching the heartstone.

* * *

**Effect** The _heartstone_ attempts to counteract one disease affecting you (counteract rank 7, counteract modifier 1d20+23).

* * *

**Craft Requirements** You must be a night hag.
