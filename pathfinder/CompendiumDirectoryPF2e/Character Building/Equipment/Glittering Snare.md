# Glittering Snare
## Item 4
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[consumable]][[mechanical]][[snare]][[trap]][[visual]]

**Category** snare; 
**Price** 18 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

Small flecks of mica, sand, and ground glass are packed into a spring-loaded canister that can be rigged to a trip wire or hidden in a container. The first creature to enter the square or open the container must attempt a `DC 20 Reflex check` save as the area is showered with bright, glittering dust that sticks to skin, fur, and clothing.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature takes a -1 status penalty to Stealth checks for 1 minute or until it uses an Interact action to remove the glitter.

[[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Glittering Snare (Success)|Effect: Glittering Snare (Success)]]

**Failure** The creature takes a -2 status penalty to Stealth checks for 2 minutes or until it spends a 2-action activity, which has the manipulate trait, to remove the glitter. If the creature was [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]], the glitter outlines it for 1 round, making it [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] rather than [[Conditions/Undetected|Undetected]] to visual senses.

[[Equipment Effects/Effect_ Glittering Snare (Failure)|Effect: Glittering Snare (Failure)]]

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the penalty is -4. The glitter sticks for 5 minutes or until the creature spends a 3-action activity, which has the manipulate trait, to remove it. The glitter continues to fall around the creature until completely removed, leaving a trail behind it as it moves and revealing its rough location; the creature is [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]], rather than undetected, to any creature that can see the glitter whenever it would otherwise have been undetected.
