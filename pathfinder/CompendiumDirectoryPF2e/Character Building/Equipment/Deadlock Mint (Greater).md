_Deadlock mint_ is a species of mint with small, green flowers, said to grow on battlefields where the opposing sides were equally matched. Sprigs of the flowers blow gently in a breeze of their own creation. If you cast [[Spells/Mystic Armor|Mystic Armor]] using _deadlock mint_, you release a small blast of concussive air in an emanation of a size that depends on the catalyst's type. Unattended objects up to a certain Bulk limit are pushed away from you. Large or smaller creatures must succeed at a Fortitude save equal to your spell save DC or be pushed the same distance away from you.

Objects of 1 Bulk or less and creatures that fail the save are pushed 10 feet. Objects of up to 2 Bulk are pushed 5 feet, and Huge creatures must succeed at the save or be pushed 5 feet.
