# Superior Catch Pole
## Item 4
### 


**Price** 80 gp; 
**Bulk** 1; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-two-hands

This sturdy pole has a rope attached to one end in a loop with the other end extending to the handle. You can pull the handle side of the rope to tighten the loop. Using this loop, you can [[Actions/Grapple|Grapple]] without having a free hand. A creature grappled this way receives a â€“2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls when Striking with an unarmed attack. Due to limitations in the size of the loop, a catch pole can only be used on creatures sized Medium or smaller.

A superior catch pole has a pole made of dawnsilver, and the loop at the end is silk rope, making it sturdier and more agile. It functions the same as a catch pole but gives you a +1 item bonus to Athletics checks made to Grapple with it.
