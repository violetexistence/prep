## Item 7
### [[magical]]


**Price** 300 gp;

**Usage** held-in-one-hand

This ball of hempen twine resists efforts to unravel it by hand.

**Activateâ€”Unravel Twine** `pf2:1` (manipulate)

**Effect** You toss the ball of twine into a square within 20 feet. The twine then unravels and animates, attempting to [[Actions/Disarm|Disarm]] or [[Actions/Trip|Trip]] (your choice) a creature in the square with a total of +15 to the Athletics check. At the end of your turn, the twine winds itself back into a ball and returns to your hand; if you don't have a free hand, it returns to your space instead.
