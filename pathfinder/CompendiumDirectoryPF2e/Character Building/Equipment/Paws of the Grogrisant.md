Princess Eutropia commissioned Taldor's Imperial College of Heralds to preserve the paws that fell off the Mantle of the Grogrisant. A few weeks later, the college presented this pair of boots. You gain a +3 item bonus to Athletics checks and saves against forced movement. When you invest in the boots, you either increase your Strength modifier by 1 or increase it to +4, whichever would give you a higher value.

**Activateâ€”Grogrisant Leap** `pf2:1` (concentrate)
