# Bellflower Toolbelt
## Item 6
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[invested]][[magical]]


**Price** 220 gp; 
**Bulk** 1; **Size** med
**Usage** wornbelt

Different versions of the bellflower toolbelt are customized to appear to suit specific trades, so a belt used for carpentry would look different from a belt for baking.

**Activate** `pf2:2` (concentrate, manipulate)

**Effect** You place an object of up to 1 Bulk into the belt, transforming that object into a tool befitting the trade for which the belt was created. Each object remains transformed until it has been removed from the belt for 24 hours or someone uses a single Interact action to return it to its normal form. If enough transformed items are in it, the belt can be used as an [[Equipment/Artisan's Toolkit|Artisan's Toolkit]] for that trade.
