Hardened clumps of _amphisbaena spittle_ can be harvested from the dual-headed snake's hunting grounds. When a casting of [[Spells/Web of Eyes|Web of Eyes]] is empowered with this catalyst, you can place an additional scrying sensor on the back of each target's head, in the shape of a closed snake's eye. When a target shares their vision with the others affected by the spell, the eye blinks open, preventing the target from being flanked until the start of its next turn.
