This hearty meat-and-potato stew has an unusual shine to it and seems to sparkle when it catches the right light. That's because it's been infused with a specially treated iron dust, which Sanra Copperstone promises will strengthen the bones and make for healthier skin. Eating this delicious, if metallic, stew adds that same sheen to your own skin, while also hardening it. You gain 3 resistance to physical damage for 1 minute, but take a â€“2 item penalty to Acrobatics and Athletics checks during that time.
