# Immovable Tripod
## Item 10
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[magical]]


**Price** 700 gp; 
**Bulk** 1; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

This copper tripod with an immovable rod at its core is a perfect example of engineering ingenuity applied to magic items, adapting the eccentric power of an immovable rod for the pragmatic use of stabilizing weapons without the need for solid ground on which to stabilize them. In addition to extraplanar and aquatic environments, these devices have seen use by flying and climbing snipers who would otherwise have no way to mitigate their weapons' fierce kickback.

**Activate** `pf2:1` (manipulate)

* * *

**Effect** You deploy the tripod and press a button to lock it into place via the immovable rod, allowing you to deploy the tripod in midair, underwater, or anywhere else where you don't have a solid horizontal surface available. If you Activate the tripod by pushing the button again, you release and retrieve the tripod. While anchored, the tripod can be moved only if 8,000 pounds of pressure are applied to it or if a creature uses Athletics to [[Actions/Force Open|Force Open]] the tripod with a DC of [[Actions/force-open dc=40|force-open dc=40]]{40} (though most intelligent creatures can just push the button to release the tripod).
