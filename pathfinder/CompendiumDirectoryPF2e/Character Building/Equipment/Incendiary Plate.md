This bright-red _+3 greater resilient full plate_ is adorned with eerily beautiful, angry flames that flow and glow with your movement, making it appear as if you are engulfed in a living fire. You gain resistance 10 to fire while wearing this armor.

**Effect** The armor engulfs you in a vortex of living fire in a 15-foot emanation for 10 minutes. Creatures that enter this aura or start their turn within it take 10d6 fire damage (`DC 40 Reflex check` save). This area is difficult terrain for other creatures.
