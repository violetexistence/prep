# Sextant of the Night
## Item 4
### [[magical]]


**Price** 95 gp; 
**Bulk** 1; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

This finely wrought sextant is made from silver with several onyx mirrors and shades made from thin sets of crystal glass. A fine spyglass made of silver is affixed to the frame; removing the spyglass destroys the sextant. By all appearances, the sextant shouldn't function, as the shades and mirrors are swapped, but when you look through the spyglass, you see a night sky during the day and the sun during the night, as if day and night were inverted. When you use the sextant, you gain a +1 item bonus to Survival checks, which increases to a +2 item bonus when you [[Actions/Sense Direction|Sense Direction]].
