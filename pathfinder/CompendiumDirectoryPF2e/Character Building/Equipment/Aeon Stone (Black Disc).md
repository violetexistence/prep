This aeon stone slowly infuses void energy into your body. The stone deals 1 persistent void damage to you (10 void damage per minute) so long as it's invested, and you can't recover from persistent void damage while you have the stone invested.

The resonant power grants you resistance 10 to holy and to vitality damage.
