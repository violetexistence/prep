Tiny black motes swirl inside this crystalline vial. The vial can be thrown up to 20 feet, shattering and releasing the motes to absorb light within a 15-foot burst. Light sources within the motes' area of effect create a 5-foot radius of dim light instead of their normal light and light sources outside the motes do not illuminate the area within them. The darkness lasts for 1 minute, but will disperse immediately in a strong wind.
