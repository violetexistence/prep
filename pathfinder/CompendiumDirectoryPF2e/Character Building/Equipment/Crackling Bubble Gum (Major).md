**Secondary Effect** `pf2:2` (sonic)

**Effect** You blow a bubble with the gum until it pops, after which it becomes inert. The pop deals 9d4 sonic to all creatures in a 15-foot cone with a `DC 34 Fortitude check` save. A creature that fails its save is also bound with sticky gum, taking a â€“10-foot item penalty to its Speed for 1 minute. The creature can remove the gum with a total of 3 Interact actions. These actions don't have to be consecutive, and other creatures can provide the actions as well.
