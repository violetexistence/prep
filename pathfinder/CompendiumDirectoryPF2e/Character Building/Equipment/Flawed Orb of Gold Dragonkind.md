# Flawed Orb of Gold Dragonkind
## Item 25
### [unique](unique "Unique Rarity Trait")[[artifact]][[magical]]


**Price** 0 gp; 
**Bulk** 1; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

Each of the legendary _Orbs of Dragonkind_ contains the essence and personality of a powerful dragon. The _Orb of Gold Dragonkind_ was the most powerful of them all, until it was shattered by Mengkare's draconic breath. Reconstructed at great expense by enslaved spellcasters toiling under the Scarlet Triad's watch, the _Flawed Orb of Gold Dragonkind_ is a shadow of its prior self, yet it remains a potent weapon against dragons of all types.

While carried, the _Flawed Orb of Gold Dragonkind_ grants its owner resistance 30 to the Breath Weapons of gold dragons. The owner also can sense if there are any dragons within 10 miles, or any gold dragons within 100 miles. When within 1 mile of a dragon, they can determine the direction to the dragon and the dragon's age category (such as young, ancient, or wyrm).

* * *

**Activate** `pf2:2` envision, Interact

**Frequency** Three times per day

**Effect** You attempt to overwhelm a dragon's mind-while you cannot control the dragon, you can render it immobile for a short time. Choose a dragon within 60 feet; the dragon can attempt to resist the orb with a `DC 30 Will check` saving throw (or higher with _orb shards_). Gold dragons take a -4 circumstance penalty to this saving throw. Any stun from this activation ends if the dragon is attacked or otherwise subject to a hostile act other than that of the orb.

* * *

**Critical Success** The dragon is unaffected.

**Success** The dragon is [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 3]].

**Failure** The dragon is stunned for as long as the orb's wielder Sustains the Activation.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but hostile actions don't end the dragon's stun.

* * *

**Destruction** The _Flawed Orb of Gold Dragonkind_ is resilient, but its imperfect nature leaves it vulnerable. It can be damaged or even destroyed by mundane attacks (Hardness 40, HP 200, BT 100). It has weakness 30 to the Breath Weapons and Strikes of gold dragons.
