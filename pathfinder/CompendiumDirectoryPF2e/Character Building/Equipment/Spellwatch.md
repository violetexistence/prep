Counter-runes chip away at unwanted magic that impedes you. You can attempt a new saving throw against one hostile spell affecting you at the start of each of your turns. If you succeed, the spell ends, and if you fail it continues unchanged, with no additional ill effect. If you're affected by multiple hostile spells, choose only one each turn to attempt the additional save against.
