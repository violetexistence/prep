### 


**Price** 20 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** worneyepiece

These goggles are usually fitted with a polished piece of yellowtoned crystal, allowing the wearer some protection against the brightness of the sun. Near the Crown of the World, a version of these goggles exists where the crystal is replaced by thin slits, mitigating the effects of the sun's reflection on snow.

When wearing these goggles, you gain a +1 item bonus to saving throws against effects that could inflict the [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] condition.
