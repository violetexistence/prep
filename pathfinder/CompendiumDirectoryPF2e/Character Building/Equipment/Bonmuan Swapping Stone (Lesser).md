# Bonmuan Swapping Stone (Lesser)
## Item 11
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[consumable]][[magical]]

**Category** other; 
**Price** 300 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

**Activate** `pf2:1` Interact

This small, opalescent stone glows with a light that constantly shifts between colors. When you activate the stone, you throw it into a space within 100 feet. The stone then casts [[Spells/Translocate|Dimension Door]] on you and transports you to itself. This destroys the stone.

You can instead hurl the stone at a creature in an attempt to bring that creature closer to you. Make a ranged Strike against a creature using your highest proficiency with a ranged weapon. The _swapping stone_ has a range increment of 15 feet. On a hit, the stone shatters against the creature, casting _dimension door_ on the creature and causing it to instantly teleport to a space adjacent to you. An unwilling creature can resist this teleportation with a successful `DC 28 Will check` save.
