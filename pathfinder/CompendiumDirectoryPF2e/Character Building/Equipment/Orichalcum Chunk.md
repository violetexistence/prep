# Orichalcum Chunk

### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[precious]]


**Price** 1000 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

The most rare and valuable skymetal, orichalcum is coveted for its incredible time-related magical properties. This dull, coppery metal isn't as physically sturdy as adamantine, but orichalcum's time-bending properties protect it, granting it greater Hardness and Hit Points. If an orichalcum item takes damage but isn't destroyed, it repairs itself completely 24 hours later.
