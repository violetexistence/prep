_Jax_ was a caravan guard who died defending her charges from a pack of Lamashtan cultists in the Spellscar Desert. Her spirit of fury and hopelessness infused her weapon upon her death, imbuing the firearm with a fragment of her soul and intelligence. The rifle, upon awakening, remembered just enough of _Jax_'s former life to think of her former wielder's name as her own.

_Jax_ is a _+1 striking fearsome piercing wind_ whose driving purpose is to protect innocent travelers in the Spellscar Desert from raiders, bandits, and cultists. _Jax_ allows any creature to wield her, but she doesn't reveal her intelligence or powers until she detects an innocent in danger or if her wielder has proven themselves a worthy champion of justice. If she deems a wielder to be unworthy, _Jax_ uses her dominate ability to control the wielder until she can find a new one.

If ever used to attack an innocent traveler, or if, in _Jax_'s opinion, the attack could be considered banditry, the weapon automatically misfires. If _Jax_ witnesses an innocent harmed or killed, she empathically urges her wielder to avenge the victim. If the wielder doesn't comply, _Jax_ attempts to cast dominate (below). Even if the dominate spell fails, _Jax_ withholds all magical abilities, including the +1 weapon potency rune and striking rune, until her wielder redeems themself.

**Activate** `pf2:1` (command)

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** _Jax_ deems you an unworthy agent of justice. She casts [[Spells/Dominate|Dominate]] on you (`DC 24 Will check`). If you're chaotic or a worshipper of Lamashtu, you take a -2 penalty to your Will save, and the result of your save is one degree of success worse than the result you rolled. _Jax_ orders you to fight banditry and protect innocent travelers in the Spellscar Desert, renewing the spell as often as necessary until you cease your lawless ways.
