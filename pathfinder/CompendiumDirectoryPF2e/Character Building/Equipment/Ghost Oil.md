# Ghost Oil
## Item 4
### [[consumable]][[magical]][[oil]]

**Category** oil; 
**Price** 18 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

The vials containing this translucent, unsubstantial oil are always cold to the touch. Applying _ghost oil_ to a melee weapon you're wielding or carrying causes it to become semitransparent and gain the effects of a _[[Equipment/Ghost Touch|Ghost Touch]]_ rune, but it also makes the weapon unable to harm corporeal creatures. The oil has no effect when applied to another creature's weapon. The effect of the oil lasts for 1 minute.
