This _+1 striking dagger_ made of black stone is carved from the bloodstained earth of the Shadefields and carries the grudge of the Shoanti who perished on that battlefield.

**Activateâ€”Vengeful Blood** `pf2:1` (concentrate, emotion, fear, mental, visual)

**Frequency** once per hour

**Effect** Blood seeps out of the knife, coating your hand. Enemies within 30 feet who can see this must succeed at a `DC 26 Will check` save or become [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]] (frightened 1 and [[Conditions/Doomed|Doomed 1]] on a critical failure). The knife continues to bleed for 1 minute or until you make a successful Strike with it, which deals an additional 1d6 persistent bleed damage.
