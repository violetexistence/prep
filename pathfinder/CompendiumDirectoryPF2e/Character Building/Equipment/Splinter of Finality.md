# Splinter of Finality
## Item 2
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[artifact]][[invested]][[occult]]


**Price** 0 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

The sharpness of this dark metal splinter never dulls. By plunging it into your neck, you anchor your soul to the fragment, granting you protection from those that would harm it at the cost of weakening your body. You take a –1 status penalty to saving throws against effects that would give you the [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy]], [[Conditions/Drained|Drained]], or [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled]] condition. At 10th level, the penalty increases to –2. However, you gain spirit resistance equal to your level and a +2 status bonus to saving throws against spirits or haunts and effects that would give you the [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]], [[Conditions/Controlled|Controlled]], [[Conditions/Doomed|Doomed]], or [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied]] conditions.

**Destruction** All 13 splinters of finality must be gathered and used to reconstruct _Silent Lenore_, which must then be destroyed by means of the [[Spells/Blunt the Final Blade|Blunt the Final Blade]] ritual.
