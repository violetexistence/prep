These ominous swords are decorated with crimson lacquer and serve as perfect conduits for the Crimson Oath's power. The first was granted to Clarethe Iomedar by a mysterious patron who many Reclaimers believe to be an emissary of Ragathiel.

A crimson brand is a +1 striking [[Equipment/Wounding|Wounding]] bastard sword. When the wielder uses the crimson brand to cast [[Spells/Invoke the Crimson Oath|Invoke the Crimson Oath]], they can generate a 60-foot line or a 30-foot cone instead of the normal 20-foot cone.

Whenever the wielder would inflict persistent bleed damage on an undead creature with the _crimson brand_, they can instead wreathe the creature in ruby energy, inflicting the same amount of persistent vitality damage instead of persistent bleed damage.
