**Effect** You attempt to [[Actions/Grapple|Grapple]], [[Actions/Shove|Shove]], or [[Actions/Trip|Trip]] the creature you hit with the successful Strike, even if you have no hand free. You gain a +2 status bonus to your check. If you Grapple using a weapon, you can Strike with the weapon only if it has the grapple trait and you Strike the [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] target, or if you cease Grabbing with the weapon. After the effect of the initial Grapple ends, you can't keep a target grabbed with a weapon that lacks the grapple trait. The status bonus increases to +3 if you're at least 17th level.
