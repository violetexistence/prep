A goo grenade is a flask filled with a fast-growing, short-lived alchemical ooze. When you hit a creature with a goo grenade, that creature takes 1d4 acid damage, 1 persistent acid damage, and 1 acid splash damage, and a -5 circumstance penalty to its Speeds from the clinging goo. The target can end any penalties, conditions, and persistent damage caused by the bomb by Escaping (DC 15) or spending a total of 3 Interact actions to pry themselves free of the ooze. These Interact actions don't have to be consecutive, and other creatures can provide the actions as well.
