A custom, lightweight mail is fitted within the lining of a coat or similar apparel, physically hiding the armor while maintaining the wearer's fashion. While not nearly as protective as heavier armors, the armored coat allows the wearer to blend in more aesthetically during civilian functions. Like other suits of armor, the armored coat is custom-fitted to an individual's body type, ensuring comfort without sacrificing its defensive capabilities.
