This armband is woven from overlapping raven feathers, including one large feather from a kadlaka. As long as you wear it, you understand what ravens are saying, but you can't speak to ravens unless you activate the _raven band_.

**Effect** When you stroke the kadlaka feather, the raven band gives you the effects of [[Spells/Speak with Animals|Speak with Animals]], except that you can speak with and understand only birds, not other animals.
