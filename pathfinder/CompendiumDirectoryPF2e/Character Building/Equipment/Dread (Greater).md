# Dread (Greater)
## Item 18
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")


**Price** 21000 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** etched-onto-armor

Eerie symbols cover your armor, inspiring terror in your foes. Frightened enemies within 30 feet that can see you must attempt a `DC 38 Will check` save at the end of their turn; on a failure, the value of their [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened]] condition doesn't decrease that turn, no matter the value.
