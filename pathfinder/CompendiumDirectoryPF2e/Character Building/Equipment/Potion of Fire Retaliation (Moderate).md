For 1 minute after drinking a potion of fire retaliation, you glow with a faint aura of fire energy, and a creature that touches you (such as by making an unarmed attack or using a spell with a range of touch against you) or is adjacent to you and hits you with a melee weapon strike takes fire damage.

The aura deals 2d4 fire damage.
