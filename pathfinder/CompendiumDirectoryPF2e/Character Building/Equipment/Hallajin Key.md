These allies regain Hit Points and recover from conditions as if they had 24 hours of rest. They can make their daily preparations again, with access to all their spell slots and any other daily abilities, even if they already used or expended them. Daily preparations happen as part of this activation, even if it would normally require an hour of study, prayer, or communion.
