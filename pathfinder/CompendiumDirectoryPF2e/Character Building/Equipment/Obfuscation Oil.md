# Obfuscation Oil
## Item 15
### [[consumable]][[magical]][[oil]]

You can spread this blue-gray gel on a single item with a Bulk of 3 or less to ward it against magical detection. It becomes immune to divination magic of 8th rank or lower (such as [[Spells/Locate|Locate]]). This oil is permanent, but it can be removed with acid. Removing the oil in this way usually takes 1 minute for objects with Bulk of 1 or less, or a number of minutes equal to the item's Bulk.
