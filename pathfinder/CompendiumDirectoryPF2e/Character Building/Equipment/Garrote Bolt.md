The shaft of this silver bolt is engraved with wiry designs.

When a _garrote bolt_ hits a target, it transforms into a silver garrote and wraps around one of the target's appendages, dealing an additional 2d12 persistent slashing damage. On a critical hit, it wraps around the target's throat, and the target can't breathe until the persistent damage ends.
