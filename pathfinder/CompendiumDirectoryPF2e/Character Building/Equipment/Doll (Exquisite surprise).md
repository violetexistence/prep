# Doll (Exquisite surprise)
## Item 2
### 


**Price** 10 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

This doll contains a hidden compartment or pouch capable of holding a single object of up to light Bulkâ€”typically a bell, rattle, or dried flowers.

Hiding an object inside this beautifully crafted surprise doll grants you a +1 item bonus to Stealth checks made to Conceal an Item, as the compartment is particularly well-hidden and weighted to ensure the doll doesn't feel off-balance with an item inside.
