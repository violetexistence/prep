# Extra Lung
## Item 8
### [[air]][[invested]][[magical]]


**Price** 500 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** worn

An _extra lung_ is a waterproofed bladder of air worn in an underarm holster, connected to the wearer's nose by a long tube. You can use it as a source of air instead of breathing in the air around you. It can hold 5 rounds' worth of breathable air, and can be refilled if the _extra lung_ is left open for 10 minutes in an environment with suitable air.

You can switch to breathing from the _extra lung_ at any time, without using an action. You can use air from the bladder following the rules for holding your breath, but you can speak without losing the air from the _extra lung_. When you lose air at the end of each of your turns, choose whether you use breath you're holding or air from the _extra lung_. Speaking causes you to lose breath you're holding but doesn't affect the air in the _extra lung_.

**Activateâ€”Cough Up** `pf2:r` (manipulate)

**Trigger** You breathe in an inhaled poison or other inhaled affliction

* * *

**Effect** You cough the poison or tainted air into your _extra lung_, immediately attempting a new save against the effect. The air inside your _extra lung_ becomes fouled, and you re-expose yourself to the inhaled affliction if you breathe it in. The _extra lung_ is cleansed of any poison it contains every day at dawn.
