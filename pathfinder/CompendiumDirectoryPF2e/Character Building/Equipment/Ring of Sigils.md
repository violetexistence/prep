# Ring of Sigils
## Item 1
### [[arcane]][[invested]]


**Price** 20 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** worn

This silver band is carved with the personal sigils of different individuals, adding one to represent you when you invest it. The ring allows you to cast [[Spells/Sigil|Sigil]] as an arcane innate cantrip.

* * *

**Activateâ€”Track Sigil** `pf2:1` (concentrate, detection)

**Frequency** once per 10 minutes

**Effect** You detect the general direction toward the most recent _sigil_ you created using the ring. This activation fails if the _sigil_ is more than 5 miles away or if there's lead or running water between you and the _sigil_.
