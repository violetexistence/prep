This weapon features stylized etchings of giants. A giant-killing weapon deals an additional 2d6 mental damage on a successful Strike against a giant. Mental damage dealt by this weapon ignores the target's mental resistance.

On a critical hit, instead of being [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]], the giant must attempt a `DC 34 Fortitude check` save with the following effects.

**Critical Success** The giant is enfeebled 1 until the end of your next turn.

**Success** The giant is [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 2]] until the end of your next turn and takes 1d10 mental damage.

**Failure** The giant is enfeebled 2 for the next minute and takes 2d10 mental damage.

**Critical Failure** The giant is [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 4]] for the next minute and takes 4d10 mental damage.
