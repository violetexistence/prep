With an aerodynamic cutting edge and a curved handle, this _+2 striking battle axe_ is perfectly suited to whirling motions, and in fact seems like it wants to whirl free from your grip. A Strike with this axe that benefits from the sweep trait's circumstance bonus on attack rolls also gains a +2 circumstance bonus to the damage roll.

**Effect** You hurl the axe, which spins at great speed as it flies to a distant point and returns to you, leaving a trail of carnage. Each creature in a 120-foot line must succeed at a `DC 28 Reflex check` save or take damage equal to the weapon's melee damage, including your Strength modifier.
