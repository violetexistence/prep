# Eyecatcher
## Item 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[adjustment]]


**Price** 2 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** applied-to-a-weapon

An eyecatcher is a simple tassel, reflective basket hilt, or other accessory attached to a weapon to serve as a distraction. You gain a +1 item bonus to Deception checks to [[Actions/Feint|Feint]] while using a weapon with an eyecatcher attached. An eyecatcher affects the balancing of a weapon, making it slightly more unwieldy. This increases the weapon's Bulk by 1 and grants a â€“1 penalty to damage rolls with the weapon.
