# Echo Token
## Item 1
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[consumable]][[magical]]

**Category** other; 
**Price** 3 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

Visitors to the Echo Repository always emerge with one of these silver coins, stamped with the visage of a faceless queen, somewhere on their person. An _echo token_ carries a minute shard of the Echo Repository's mission to impart lost information.

**Activateâ€”Flip Coin** `pf2:1` (manipulate)

* * *

**Effect** When flipped, the coin disintegrates into a glittery mist. You learn and memorize one random fact about a specific type of Lore (such as Architecture Lore, Elf Lore, Astral Plane Lore) that you didn't previously know, chosen by the GM. The next time you attempt a check to Recall Knowledge on this type of Lore within the next year, you gain a +1 status bonus on the check. You can benefit from only one _echo token_ at a time in this way; if you Flip another _echo token_, the Lore skill changes. However, the memorized fact will remain perfectly in your memory forever unless magically altered or removed.
