This small hunk of slightly rusted iron gives off a faint reddish glow that occasionally pulses when touched. Tales of _penultimate heartbeats_ say that the metal attracts a creature's spirit at the moment of death and channels it outward for a grisly display. Once applied to a weapon, a _penultimate heartbeat_'s effects last for 1 hour.

When you reduce a living creature to 0 Hit Points with a weapon under the effect of a _penultimate heartbeat_, it doesn't perish immediately (though is visibly on the brink of death). You can [[Actions/Reposition|Reposition]] the creature up to 10 feet as a free action, after which it dies in a dramatic fashion appropriate to the injury that killed it. Foes in a 30-foot cone you direct originating from the creature's final position are sprayed with gore, taking 9d10 spirit damage from the release of the creature's soul. An affected target attempts a `Will check` save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. This effect has the emotion, fear, and mental traits.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature takes half damage and is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]] from the shock.

**Failure** The creature takes full damage and is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]]. For the remainder of the _penultimate heartbeat_'s duration, the creature can't reduce the value of the frightened condition below 1 if it ends its turn where it can see you.

**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 3]]. For the remainder of the _penultimate heartbeat_'s duration, the creature can't reduce the value of the frightened condition below 2 if it ends its turn where it can see you.
