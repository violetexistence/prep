Though the body of this _+2 striking impactful boomerang_ is riddled with glowing hairline cracks, the weapon feels reassuringly solid in the hand. If you damage a target that has been struck by a _rime foil_ within the last round, you bruise its chilled body, and the target takes a –5-foot penalty to all its Speeds, or a –10-foot penalty on a critical hit.

**Special** The shattered plan pairs with the _[[Equipment/Rime Foil|Rime Foil]]_.
