The _scarlet queen_ is a _+2 striking flaming hammer gun_. Due to the awkward and complex nature of combination weapons, it's by far the least popular of Ornmarr's designs, but those who have mastered it consider it his finest creation to date. The glistening red steel always feels warm to the touch and sheds dim light in a 15-foot radius. Any non-magical object of light Bulk destroyed by the _scarlet queen_ is reduced completely to ash.
