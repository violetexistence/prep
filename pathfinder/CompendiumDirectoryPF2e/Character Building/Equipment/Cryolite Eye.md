# Cryolite Eye
## Item 6
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[contract]][[invested]][[magical]]


**Price** 0 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** other

You tore your eye from the socket and offered it to whatever spirit would take it. In return, you received a glass eye in its place. This eye allows you to see as normal, and when you succeed at a Perception check against an illusion, you get a critical success instead. Once per day, from any distance, the entity that holds your _bargained contract_ can overwhelm your cryolite eye with magical energy, causing images to float over your vision that inflict the [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] condition on you for 1 minute.

**Activate** `pf2:2` command

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** You look through the glass eye sealing your _bargained contract_. The contract casts [[Spells/See the Unseen|See the Unseen]] affecting you.
