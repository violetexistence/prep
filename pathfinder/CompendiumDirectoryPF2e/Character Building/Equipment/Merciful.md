# Merciful
## Item 4
### [[magical]][[mental]]


**Price** 70 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** etched-onto-a-weapon

Merciful weapons are sheathed in an unmistakable wispy green aura recognized by both gladiators and guards around the world. A _merciful_ weapon has the nonlethal trait and can't be used to make a lethal attack. Any persistent damage the weapon would deal is negated.

On a critical hit, a _merciful_ weapon causes the target to become [[Conditions/Fascinated|Fascinated]] with the weapon's wielder for 1 minute, as the target is bombarded with feelings of guilt and remorse. This is a mental effect. If you have access to the weapon's critical specialization effect, you choose whether to use it or the _merciful_ effect.
