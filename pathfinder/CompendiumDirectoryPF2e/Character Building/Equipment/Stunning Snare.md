# Stunning Snare
## Item 12
### [[consumable]][[mechanical]][[snare]][[trap]]

**Category** snare; 
**Price** 320 gp;

You rig a snare to disorient a creature with a quick bash, leaving it with little ability to defend itself. The trap deals 10d6 bludgeoning damage to the first creature to enter its square; that creature must attempt a `DC 32 Reflex check` save.
