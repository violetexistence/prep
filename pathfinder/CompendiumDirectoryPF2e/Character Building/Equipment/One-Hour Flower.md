Popular with lovers, decorators, and sports fans, the seeds of these ephemeral plants grow and bloom immediately into flowers when placed in any warm environment, including a cup of dirt, a bowl of warm water, and a tightly clenched hand. The color of these flowers varies, but each has an internal glow that sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius. The radius of this light shrinks by 10 feet every 20 minutes. At the end of an hour, the plant disintegrates, leaving only a vaguely pleasant scent in the air.
