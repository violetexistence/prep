# Gyroscopic Stabilizer
## Item 4
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[magical]]


**Price** 115 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** affixed-to-firearm

A gyroscopic stabilizer appears as a gold disk suspended within three rotating golden bands inside a gilded case, itself attached to a set of clamps. These clamps allow you to attach the gyroscopic stabilizer to any one-handed firearm as an Interact action.

**Activate** `pf2:1` Interact

**Frequency** once per hour

**Requirements** The gyroscopic stabilizer is attached to a one-handed firearm without the fatal or fatal aim traits

* * *

**Effect** The gyroscopic stabilizer begins spinning for 1 minute. While the gyroscopic stabilizer is spinning, the weapon it's attached to gains the fatal aim weapon trait with a die one size larger than its damage die (maximum d12). This allows you to wield it in two hands to grant it the fatal trait.
