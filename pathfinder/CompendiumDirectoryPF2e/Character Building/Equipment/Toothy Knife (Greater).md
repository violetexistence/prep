This jagged bit of metal is pitted and worn but wickedly sharp. The DC of the flat check to end persistent bleed damage dealt by a weapon under the effects of a _greater toothy knife_ is 19 (or 14 with appropriate assistance). This bleeding still typically ends on its own after 1 minute, as normal.
