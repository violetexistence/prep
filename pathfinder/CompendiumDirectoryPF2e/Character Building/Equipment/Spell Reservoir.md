# Spell Reservoir
## Item 13
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[magical]]


**Price** 2700 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** etched-onto-melee-weapon

A _spell reservoir_ rune creates a pool of eldritch energy within the etched weapon. A spellcaster can spend 1 minute to cast a spell of 3rd rank or lower into the weapon. The spell must require 2 actions or fewer to cast and must be able to target a creature other than the caster. The spell has no immediate effect—it is instead stored for later.

When you wield a _spell reservoir_ weapon, you immediately know the name and rank of the stored spell. A _spell reservoir_ weapon found as treasure has a 50% chance of having a spell of the GM's choice stored in it.

**Activate—Channeled Release** `pf2:2` (concentrate)

**Requirements** A spell is stored in the weapon

* * *

**Effect** Make a Strike with the weapon. You expend the stored spell as part of this Strike; this empties the spell from the weapon and allows a spell to be cast into it again. If the Strike hits, the spell targets the target of the attack. If the spell requires a spell attack roll, the result of your attack roll with the weapon determines the degree of success of the spell, and if the spell requires a saving throw, the DC is 30.

**Activate—Safe Release** `pf2:1` (concentrate)

* * *

**Effect** Harmlessly expend the stored spell. This frees the weapon to have a new spell cast into it.
