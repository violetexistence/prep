**Price** 50 gp;

These brown leather shoes have surprisingly thick soles, as though a cobbler had recently repaired them. The tan laces always pull to exactly the right tautness for your feet and ankles to feel supported. You can perform the [[Actions/Hustle|Hustle]] exploration mode activity for twice as many minutes as normal, equal to your Constitution modifier × 20 (minimum 20).

**Activate—Big Step** `pf2:1` (concentrate)

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** The soles on your boots grow even thicker for a moment, proving a bounce to your step. You Step twice.
