This dark, iridescent scale is about the size of a small coin. When you swallow the scale, you immediately grow a patch of scales that cover the majority of your body.

For 1 hour, you can hold your breath for 15 rounds plus your Constitution modifier (instead of 5 rounds + your Constitution modifier) before drowning. It has no effect in non-aquatic environments that require you to hold your breath.

After this time, the scales wither and fall off your body.
