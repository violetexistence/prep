# Basic Companion Chair

### [[barding]][[companion]]


**Price** 4 sp;

This harness fits around the torso of an animal companion and connects via struts to a number of wheels to assist the companion's movement. Companion chairs can be fitted for animal companions of any shape or size and have two- and four-wheel configurations. Like the basic chair, a companion chair is ideal for everyday use but not more strenuous activity, making it more common among non-adventurers.
