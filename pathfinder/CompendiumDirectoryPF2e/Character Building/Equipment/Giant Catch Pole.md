# Giant Catch Pole
## Item 3
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")


**Price** 50 gp; 
**Bulk** 2; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-two-hands

This sturdy pole has a rope attached to one end in a loop with the other end extending to the handle. You can pull the handle side of the rope to tighten the loop. Using this loop, you can [[Actions/Grapple|Grapple]] without having a free hand. A creature grappled this way receives a â€“2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls when Striking with an unarmed attack. Due to limitations in the size of the loop, a catch pole can only be used on creatures sized Medium or smaller.

A giant catch pole is made from thicker steel and heavier rope. It functions the same as a catch pole but can be used to Grapple creatures up to your normal size limit. However, the implement is so ungainly that you are [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] while wielding it.
