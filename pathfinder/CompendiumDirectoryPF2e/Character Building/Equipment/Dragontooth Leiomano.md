Dragon teeth line the edges of this +2 greater striking leiomano. The leiomano deals an additional 1d6 untyped damage of a type determined by the tradition of the dragon from which the teeth were taken: force for arcane, spirit for divine, mental for occult, or fire for primal. The weapon also gains the relevant trait (for instance, fire for a club made with teeth taken from an adamantine dragon).

**Activate** `pf2:2` (magical, manipulate)

**Frequency** once per minute

**Effect** You swing the leiomano, sending several of the dragon teeth shooting through the air on jets of energy. The dragon teeth deal 3d6 piercing damage and 3d6 untyped damage of the damage type corresponding to the dragon's tradition in a 15-foot cone (`DC 29 Reflex check` save). The teeth hunt down their targets, correcting their flight in midair, which reduces any circumstance bonus from cover by 2.

**Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials must include teeth from a dragon.
