A ghost delivery fulu's inscription resembles a dovecote with spirits around it, and it has a prominent stamp in red wax. This fulu activates once affixed, becoming the homing location of ghost courier fulus with a matching stamp. Delivered ghost courier fulu messages stick to the ghost delivery fulu but can be easily removed.
