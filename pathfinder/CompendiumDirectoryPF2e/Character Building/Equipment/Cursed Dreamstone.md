# Cursed Dreamstone
## Item 9
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[cursed]][[magical]]


**Price** 0 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

A _dreamstone_ can become cursed if left exposed to creatures that corrupt sleep, generate nightmares, or otherwise prey on sleeping or dreaming victims via supernatural methods. A _cursed dreamstone_ seems to function as a normal _dreamstone_ until the bearer falls asleep or is forced to attempt a saving throw against a sleep effect. At this point, the person carrying the cursed _dreamstone_ must attempt a `DC 26 Will check` save to resist the curse's effects.

**Critical Success** The character resists the curse entirely and experiences a vivid dream while sleeping that warns them of the nature of the _cursed dreamstone_.

**Success** The character resists the curse.

**Failure** As long as the cursed character possesses the stone, they are fatigued whenever they wake from sleep, whether natural or magically induced, and they take a -2 item penalty to all saving throws against sleep effects instead of gaining the normal bonus from a _dreamstone_.

**Critical Failure** As failure, and whenever the bearer attempts a saving throw against a sleep effect, they get the outcome that is one degree worse than the result of their saving throw.
