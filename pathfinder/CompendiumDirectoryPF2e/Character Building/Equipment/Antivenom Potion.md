This cloudy, white liquid helps protect against poisons. When you drink an antivenom potion, you can immediately attempt a `DC 10 Flat check` to end any persistent poison damage you're taking. In addition, for 1 minute after drinking the potion, you gain a +1 bonus to Fortitude saving throws to avoid taking persistent poison damage.
