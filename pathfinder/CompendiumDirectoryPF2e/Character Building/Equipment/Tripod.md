# Tripod

### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")


**Price** 2 sp; 
**Bulk** 1; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-two-hands

Tripods are designed for use with kickback weapons, as a way for gunslingers with lower strength to accurately use these more powerful weapons by sacrificing mobility instead. They can be set up and attached to a firearm with a single Interact action using one hand, setting the tripod in your square. While this sturdy piece of engineering is in use, you don't take the -2 penalty for firing a kickback weapon, even if your Strength isn't high enough to avoid the penalty. However, you must retrieve the tripod with a single Interact action before you can move the firearm to a different position. Normally, when you're [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] or [[Conditions/Undetected|Undetected]], you become observed if you do anything except [[Actions/Hide|Hide]], [[Actions/Sneak|Sneak]], or Step. However, deploying or retrieving a tripod with an Interact action doesn't automatically make you observed, so long as you don't set up or remove the tripod when it's in a spot where creatures can see the tripod itself.
