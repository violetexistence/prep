# Large Bore Modifications
## Item 5
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")


**Price** 120 gp; 
**Bulk** 1; **Size** med
**Usage** attached-to-firearm

These modifications include a heavier stock and larger replacement barrel designed to increase the stopping power of firearms. _Large bore modifications_ can only be applied to firearms with the kickback or scatter traits, and attaching _large bore modifications_ takes 1 hour, though this time can overlap with the standard time required to maintain and clean your firearm to prevent misfires.

When you attach _large bore modifications_ to a kickback weapon, the bonus to damage granted by the kickback trait increases from 1 to 2 additional Damage and the Strength requirement to fire the weapon without penalty increases to +4.

When you attach _large bore modifications_ to a weapon with the scatter trait, the radius of the scatter effect increases by 5 feet, but the weapon imposes a -2 penalty on attack rolls if the wielder's Strength modifier is less than +2. If the weapon has both the kickback and scatter traits, apply both sets of modifications with the Strength requirement raised to +4 to avoid penalties when firing.
