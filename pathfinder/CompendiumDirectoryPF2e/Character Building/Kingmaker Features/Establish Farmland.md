# Establish Farmland
## 
### [[downtime]][[region]]

**Category** kingdom-activity; 




**Requirements** Plains or hills are the predominant terrain feature in the hex; the hex is in the influence of one of your settlements.

* * *

You plant crops and establish livestock in permanent farms, ranches, and other growing operations to create Farmland. If you're attempting to Establish Farmland in a hex that is predominantly plains, you must spend 1 RP and the check is against your Control DC. If you're targeting a hex that is predominantly hills, you must spend 2 RP and the check is against your Control DC + 5.

* * *

**Critical Success** You establish two adjacent Farmland hexes instead of one. If your target hex was a hills hex, the additional hex may be a hills hex or a plains hex; otherwise, the additional hex must be a plains hex. If no appropriate hex is available, treat this result as a regular success instead.

**Success** You establish one Farmland hex.

**Failure** You fail to establish a Farmland hex.

**Critical Failure** You fail to establish a Farmland hex, and your attempt potentially causes the spread of a blight. At the start of each of the next two Event phases, attempt a `DC 6 Flat check`; on a failure, your kingdom experiences a Crop Failure event in this and all adjacent hexes
