# Train Army
## 
### [[army]][[downtime]]

**Category** kingdom-activity; 




You train an army in the use of a tactic. Choose one of the tactics from those listed starting on page 575, then attempt a Scholarship or Warfare check against the tactic's Training DC. If your army has already learned its maximum number of tactics, the newly learned tactic replaces a previously learned tactic of your choice.

* * *

**Critical Success** The army learns the tactic and then becomes efficient.

**Success** The army learns the tactic.

**Failure** The army fails to learn the tactic.

**Critical Failure** The army not only fails to learn the tactic but becomes frustrated and exhausted from the training; increase the army's weary condition by 1.
