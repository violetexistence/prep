## 
### [[cavalry]][[maneuver]][[skirmisher]]

**Category** army-war-action; 




**Requirement** [[Kingmaker Features/Reckless Flankers|Reckless Flankers]], you aren't engaged

* * *

You send your army around an enemy's flank to get a better attacking position and to push your enemy into disorder. Attempt a `Maneuver check` check against the target army.

**Critical Success** The target army becomes [[Kingmaker Features/Outflanked|Outflanked]] until the start of your next turn. You can choose to become [[Kingmaker Features/Engaged|Engaged]] with that army or not.

**Success** The target army is outflanked until the start of your next turn. You are now engaged with that army.

**Critical Failure** You underestimate the target army's position, and the blunder causes your army to become outflanked until the start of your next turn.
