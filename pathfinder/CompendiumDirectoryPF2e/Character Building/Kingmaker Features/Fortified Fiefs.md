Your vassals take their duty to protect those under their stewardship seriously, and your engineers emphasize the value of a strong defense when it comes to building settlements and fortifications. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to checks attempted as part of the Fortify Hex activity and on activities to build or repair a Barracks, Castle, Garrison, Keep, Stone Wall, or Wooden Wall. In addition, you gain a +1 status bonus to all kingdom checks attempted during dangerous events that directly impact your settlements' defenses.
