# Fortified

### 






The army is in a defensive position as the result of a Garrison Army activity. While fortified, enemy armies cannot engage the army and the army cannot engage enemy armies. A fortified army gains a +4 item bonus to its AC and to Morale checks made to rally. A fortified army that uses a maneuver war action immediately loses its fortified condition.
