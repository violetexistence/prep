# Practical Magic
## Item 1
### [[general]][[kingdom]]

**Category** kingdom-feat; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Magic
* * *
Magic has an honored place in your society, and your people incorporate it into their everyday work to make life easier. You gain a +1 status bonus to Magic checks, and you can use Magic checks in place of Engineering checks. In addition, as magic-wielding NPCs find your nation a comfortable place to live and work, you reduce the cost of using the Hire Adventurers activity to 1 RP.
