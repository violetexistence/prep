# Inspiring Entertainment
## Item 3
### [[general]][[kingdom]]

**Category** kingdom-feat; 




Your kingdom's artists and entertainers are talented and prolific, and there's never a shortage of new plays, operas, novels, music, sculptures, paintings, or other forms of distraction to entertain the citizens, even during times of upheaval. When you check for Unrest during the Upkeep phase of a Kingdom turn, you may roll a Culture-based check rather than a Loyalty-based check to determine the outcome. Your kingdom also gains a +2 status bonus to all Culture-based skill checks whenever your kingdom has at least 1 Unrest.
