# Endure Anarchy
## Item 3
### [[general]][[kingdom]]

**Category** kingdom-feat; 



**Prerequisites** Loyalty 14
* * *
Your kingdom holds together even in the midst of extreme peril. If your kingdom's Unrest is 6 or higher and you use a kingdom activity that decreases Unrest, decrease the Unrest by an additional 1. You do not fall into anarchy unless your kingdom's Unrest reaches 24 (see last paragraph of Step 2: Adjust Unrest on page 538).
