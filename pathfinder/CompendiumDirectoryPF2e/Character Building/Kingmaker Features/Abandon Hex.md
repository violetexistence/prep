# Abandon Hex
## 
### [[downtime]][[region]]

**Category** kingdom-activity; 




**Requirements** The hex to be abandoned must be controlled.

* * *

After careful consideration, you decide that you would rather not hold onto a particular hex as part of your claimed territory. You renounce your claim to it and pull back any settlers or explorers. Attempt a basic `Exploration check` or `Wilderness check` check. You can abandon more than one hex at a time, but each additional hex you abandon increases the DC of this check by 1.

* * *

**Critical Success** You abandon the hex or hexes, decreasing your kingdom's Size by 1 per hex abandoned (this affects all statistics determined by Size; see page 532). Settlers and explorers return and resettle elsewhere in your kingdom, bringing with them bits of salvage from the abandoned hexes. Gain 1 RP per abandoned hex.

**Success** As critical success, but you gain no RP and increase Unrest by 1.

**Failure** You abandon the hex or hexes, decreasing your kingdom's Size by 1 per hex abandoned (this affects all statistics determined by Size; see page 532). Some citizens become disgruntled refugees who refuse to leave the hex. Increase Unrest by 2 and then attempt a `DC 6 Flat check`. If you fail, the refugees become bandits, and during your next Event phase, your kingdom experiences a Squatters kingdom event automatically in addition to any other event that might occur.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but increase Unrest by 3 and automatically experience a Bandit Activity kingdom event instead of a Squatters event.

**Special** The Unrest gained from abandoning a hex doubles if it includes a settlement. A settlement in an abandoned hex becomes a Freehold.
