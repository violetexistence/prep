# Advance `pf2:1`
## 
### [[maneuver]]

**Category** army-war-action; 




Your army attempts to close the distance with a target enemy army it is not engaged with by attempting a `Maneuver check` check.

**Critical Success** The enemy army becomes [[Kingmaker Features/Engaged|Engaged]] with your army, even if it previously had the [[Kingmaker Features/Distant|Distant]] condition (in which case it loses that condition and becomes engaged).

**Success** If the target army is distant, it loses that condition; otherwise, it becomes engaged.

**Failure** Your army's attempt to advance fails.

**Critical Failure** Your army's attempt to advance fails, and it becomes disorganized, becoming [[Kingmaker Features/Mired|Mired 1]] until the start of its next turn.
