# Fine Living
## Item 4
### 

**Category** kingdom-feature; 




Your people celebrate your leadership by indulging you with feasts and finery. All PCs associated with the kingdom enjoy a Fine standard of living (Pathfinder Core Rulebook 294) at no cost whenever they're in the kingdom. Any PCs in hostile wilderness, a monster-filled dungeon, or otherwise cut off from their citizens must provide their own sustenance as usual even if they are within the boundaries of their kingdom.

You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to all checks made to Craft or Earn Income while in your kingdom.
