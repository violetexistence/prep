# Recover Army
## 
### [[army]][[downtime]]

**Category** kingdom-activity; 




When an army endures ill fortune, it can become afflicted by negative conditions. You can use the Recover Army activity to work at removing an affliction with a basic skill check (this DC increases by 5 if you are attempting to Recover from the defeated condition); the skill required for the check depends on the affliction (see the table on page 569).

* * *

**Critical Success** You reduce the affliction's value by 2 (or in the case of a damaged army, increase its HP by 2 up to its maximum). If the affliction does not have a value, it is removed.

**Success** As critical success but you reduce the affliction's value by 1 (or in the case of a damaged army, increase its HP by 1 up to its maximum).

**Failure** You fail to remove the affliction.

**Critical Failure** You fail to remove the affliction and your soldier's lowered morale spreads discontent; increase Unrest by 1. If you were attempting to recover a defeated army, the army is destroyed.
