# Flaming Shot
## Item 9
### [[cavalry]][[infantry]][[siege]][[skirmisher]]

**Category** army-tactic; 




The army attacks with projectiles treated with alchemical or magical oils that ignite as they are fired. When your army succeeds at a ranged Strike, the target army must attempt a `Maneuver check` check against your army's attack DC; if it fails, the Strike inflicts 1 additional point of damage.
