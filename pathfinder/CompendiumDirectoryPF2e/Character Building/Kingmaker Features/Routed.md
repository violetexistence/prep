# Routed

### 






The army retreats, whether due to magical compulsion or simply broken morale. On its turn, a routed army must use the [[Kingmaker Features/Retreat|Retreat]] war action. While routed, the army takes a â€“2 circumstance penalty to Morale checks. This condition ends automatically once a war encounter is resolved, but the routed army increases its [[Kingmaker Features/Shaken|Shaken]] value by 1 in this case. If all armies on one side of a battle are routed simultaneously, the battle ends and the other army is victorious.
