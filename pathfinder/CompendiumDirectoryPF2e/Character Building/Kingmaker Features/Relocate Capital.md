# Relocate Capital
## 
### [[downtime]][[leadership]]

**Category** kingdom-activity; 




**Requirements** One of your settlements that is not your current capital must contain a Castle, Palace, or Town Hall. All leaders must spend all of their leadership activities during the Activity phase of a Kingdom turn on this activity.

The kingdom leaders announce that they are uprooting the seat of government from its current home and reestablishing it in another settlement. Attempt a `Industry check` check with a DC equal to the kingdom's Control DC + 5. You cannot Relocate your Capital again for at least 3 Kingdom turns.

**Critical Success** The move goes off splendidly, with people excited about the new capital and celebrating the leadership's wisdom.

**Success** The move goes smoothly and with minimal disruption, but some folks are upset or homesick. Increase Unrest by 1.

**Failure** The move causes unhappiness. Gain 1 Unrest and increase two Ruins of your choice by 1.

**Critical Failure** The people reject the idea of the new capital and demand you move it back. The move is unsuccessful, and your capital remains unchanged. Gain 1d4 Unrest. Increase three Ruins of your choice by 1 and the fourth Ruin by 3.
