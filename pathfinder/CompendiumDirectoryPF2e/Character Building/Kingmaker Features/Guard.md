Your army spends a war action to adopt a defensive poseâ€”raising shields, focusing on parrying attacks, or seeking cover. Attempt a `Maneuver check` check against a target army.

**Critical Success** Your army gains a +2 item bonus to its AC until the start of your next turn; this bonus applies to all attacks against this army, not just from the targeted army.
