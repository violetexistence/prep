# Lost

### 






When an army's attempt to deploy to a new location fails, it can become lost. A lost army can take no Army activity other than [[Kingmaker Features/Recover Army|Recover Army]], and that only in an attempt to remove the lost condition. When an army recovers from the lost condition, the GM decides what the army's new location is (typically this is at an approximate midpoint between the army's starting point and its intended destination).
