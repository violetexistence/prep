# Fortify Hex
## 
### [[downtime]][[region]]

**Category** kingdom-activity; 




Your command your engineers to construct a protected encampment, such as a fort or barbican, to serve as a defensive post in the hex. Spend RP as determined by the hex's most inhospitable terrain (see the Building on Rough Terrain sidebar on page 519). Then attempt a basic `Defense check` check. A fortified hex grants an additional bonus in warfare (see Appendix 3), but also gives traveling PCs a place to rest that prevents wandering monsters from interrupting their rest.

**Critical Success** You find a defensible position for your fortification and finish construction efficiently. Gain a refund of half the RP you spent to build in the hex, then reduce Unrest by 1.

**Success** You establish your fortification in the hex. Reduce Unrest by 1.

**Failure** You fail to fortify the hex.

**Critical Failure** Your attempt ends in disaster. Not only do you fail to build a structure, but you lose several workers to an accident, banditry, a vicious monster, or some other unforeseen occurrence. Gain 1 Unrest.
