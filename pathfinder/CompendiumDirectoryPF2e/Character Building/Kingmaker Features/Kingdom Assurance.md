# Kingdom Assurance
## Item 1
### [[fortune]][[general]][[kingdom]]

**Category** kingdom-feat; 



**Prerequisites** trained in at least three skills
* * *
Even when things go poorly in other areas, you can count on consistency in carrying out kingdom activities with a chosen skill. Choose one Kingdom skill in which your kingdom is trained. Once per Kingdom turn, when you would attempt a skill check for that skill, you can forgo rolling and instead take a result equal to 10 + your proficiency bonus; do not apply any other bonuses, penalties, or modifiers to this result.

**Special** You can select this feat multiple times. Each time, choose a different skill and gain the benefits of this feat for that skill.
