# Weary

### 






The army is exhausted. Weary always has a numerical value. A weary army takes a circumstance penalty equal to its weary value to its AC, to its Maneuver checks, and to its Army activity checks; it takes double this circumstance penalty on Deploy Army checks. An army reduces the value of this condition by 1 each Kingdom turn that passes during which it does not attempt an Army activity or engage in a war encounter.
