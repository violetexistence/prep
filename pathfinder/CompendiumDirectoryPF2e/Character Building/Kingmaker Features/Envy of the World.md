# Envy of the World
## Item 20
### 

**Category** kingdom-feature; 




Your kingdom is one of the world's prominent nations. The first time in a Kingdom turn when your kingdom would gain Unrest or Ruin, ignore that increase. You can ignore additional increases to Unrest or Ruin later in the same turn as well, but you must spend a Fame or Infamy point each time you do so. Your maximum Fame or Infamy point total increases by 1.
