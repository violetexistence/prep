# Demolish
## 
### [[civic]][[downtime]]

**Category** kingdom-activity; 




Choose a single occupied lot in one of your settlements and attempt a basic `Engineering check` check to reduce it to Rubble and then clear the Rubble away to make ready for a new structure. For multiple-lot structures, you'll need to perform multiple Demolish activities (or critically succeed at the activity) to fully clear all of the lots. As soon as you begin Demolishing a multiple-lot structure, all of the lots occupied by that structure no longer function.

* * *

**Critical Success** Choose one of the following effects: you demolish an entire multiple-lot structure all at once and clear all of the lots it occupied, or you recover 1d6 Commodities (chosen from lumber, stone, and ore) from the Rubble of a single-lot demolition.

**Success** You demolish the lot successfully.

**Failure** You fail to demolish the lot. It remains in Rubble and cannot be used for further construction until you successfully Demolish it.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but accidents during the demolition cost you the lives of some of your workers. Gain 1 Unrest.
