# Low-Light Vision
## Item 1
### [[cavalry]][[infantry]][[siege]][[skirmisher]]

**Category** army-tactic; 




The army includes several spotters and scouts who have low-light vision, and the rest of the soldiers have been trained to follow their lead so that the army itself functions as if it had low-light vision.
