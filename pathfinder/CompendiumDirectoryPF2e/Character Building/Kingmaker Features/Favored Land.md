# Favored Land
## Item 1
### 

**Category** kingdom-feature; 




Your heartland's terrain becomes your kingdom's favored land—the wilderness terrain that your people feel the strongest emotional ties to and to which your resource gatherers tend to flock. Once per Kingdom turn, during the Region Activities step of the Activity phase, you can attempt two Region activities simultaneously as long as both activities take place in the same hex and that hex contains the same terrain as your heartland. You take a –2 penalty to Kingdom skill checks made during these two activities.
