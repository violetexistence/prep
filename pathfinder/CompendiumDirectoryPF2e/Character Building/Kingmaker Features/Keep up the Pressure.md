# Keep up the Pressure
## Item 3
### [[cavalry]][[infantry]][[siege]][[skirmisher]]

**Category** army-tactic; 




The commander's swift, decisive directions help the army attack more accurately. If an army attacks the same target a second time in a round, its multiple attack penalty is –4 rather than –5, and if they attack that same army a third time in a round, its multiple attack penalty is –8 rather than –10.
