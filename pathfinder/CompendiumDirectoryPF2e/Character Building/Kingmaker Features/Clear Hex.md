# Clear Hex
## 
### [[downtime]][[region]]

**Category** kingdom-activity; 




Engineers and mercenaries attempt to prepare a hex to serve as the site for a settlement, or they work to remove an existing improvement, a dangerous hazard, or an encounter. If you're trying to prepare a hex for a settlement or demolish an improvement you previously built (or that was already present in the hex), spend RP as determined by the hex's most inhospitable terrain feature (see the Building on Rough Terrain sidebar nearby). Then attempt a basic `Engineering check` check. If you're trying to remove a hazard or encounter, instead attempt an `Exploration check` check. The DC of this check is set by the highest level creature or hazard in the hex (as set by Table 10â€“5: DCs by Level, on page 503 of the Pathfinder Core Rulebook). If the hex you're attempting to Clear has existing Ruins or an existing Structure, your action doesn't physically remove the buildings from the area and you can later incorporate these buildings (or repair ruined ones) into a Settlement you build here later (see page 542). Regardless of the skill used, increase the basic DC by 2 if the hex to be cleared is not yet part of your kingdom.
