# Battle `pf2:1`
## 
### [[attack]]

**Category** army-war-action; 




Your army attacks an enemy army with a Strike against the enemy army's AC. You can do so with a melee Strike only if you are [[Kingmaker Features/Engaged|Engaged]] with the target army. Otherwise, you must use a ranged Strike.

An army can attempt a maximum of 5 ranged Strikes per war encounter (unless it has the [[Kingmaker Features/Increased Ammunition|Increased Ammunition]] tactic). As with any attack, multiple Strikes in a single round suffer a multiple attack penalty.

A siege engine can use the Battle action to attack and damage a fortification.

**Critical Success** You deal 2 points of damage to the army.

**Success** You deal 1 point of damage to the army.
