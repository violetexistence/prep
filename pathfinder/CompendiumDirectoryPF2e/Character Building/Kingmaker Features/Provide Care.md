# Provide Care
## 
### [[downtime]][[leadership]]

**Category** kingdom-activity; 




Attempt a basic `Defense check` check to organize and encourage your settlements' healers, apothecaries, medics, and other caregivers to provide care and support for citizens in need.

* * *

**Critical Success** You provide unexpectedly compassionate support for the people. Reduce Unrest by 1 and reduce one Ruin of your choice by 1.

**Success** Your care soothes the worries and fears of the populace; reduce Unrest by 1.

**Failure** You don't provide any notable care for the citizens, but at least you don't make things worse.

**Critical Failure** Your attempt to provide care backfires. Increase your Unrest or a Ruin of your choice by 1.
