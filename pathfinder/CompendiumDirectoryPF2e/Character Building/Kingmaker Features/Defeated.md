# Defeated

### 






When an army has zero Hit Points, it becomes defeated. A defeated army cannot take war actions. A defeated army can be restored to 1 Hit Point with the [[Kingmaker Features/Recover Army|Recover Army]] activity (although the basic DC is increased by 5 for this check). Any effect that restores a defeated army to at least 1 Hit Point removes the defeated condition. A defeated army can only be moved one hex at a time with the [[Kingmaker Features/Deploy Army|Deploy Army]] activity. A defeated army can be [[Kingmaker Features/Disband Army|Disband Army]] normally. It can't be used for any other Army activity as long as it remains defeated. If a defeated army takes damage, it must succeed at a `DC 16 Flat check` or be [[Kingmaker Features/Destroyed|Destroyed]]. If all armies on a side are defeated, those armies are destroyed.
