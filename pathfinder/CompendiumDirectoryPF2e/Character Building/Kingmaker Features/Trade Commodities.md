# Trade Commodities
## 
### [[commerce]][[downtime]]

**Category** kingdom-activity; 




There are five different categories of Commodities: Food, Lumber, Luxuries, Ore, and Stone. When you Trade Commodities, select one Commodity that your kingdom currently stockpiles and reduce that Commodity's stockpile by up to 4. Then attempt a basic `Industry check` check. If you trade with a group that you've established diplomatic relations with, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the check.

**Critical Success** At the beginning of the next Kingdom turn, you gain 2 bonus Resource Dice per point of stockpile expended from your Commodity now.

**Success** At the beginning of your next Kingdom turn, you gain 1 bonus Resource Die per point of stockpile expended from your Commodity now.

**Failure** You gain 1 bonus Resource Die at the beginning of your next Kingdom turn.

**Critical Failure** You gain no bonus Resource Dice (though the Commodity remains depleted). If you Traded Commodities the previous turn, gain 1 Unrest.
