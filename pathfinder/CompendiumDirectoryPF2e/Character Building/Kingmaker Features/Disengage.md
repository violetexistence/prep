# Disengage `pf2:2`
## 
### [[maneuver]]

**Category** army-war-action; 




Your army attempts to disengage from enemy armies to put some distance between itself and the enemy.

Attempt a `Maneuver check` check against each army your army is [[Kingmaker Features/Engaged|Engaged]] with.

**Critical Success** Your army is no longer engaged with the target army. In addition, your army is automatically no longer engaged with any armies you haven't yet rolled a Maneuver check against during this war action.

**Success** Your army breaks free and is no longer engaged with the target army.

**Failure** Your army remains engaged with the target army.

**Critical Failure** Your army remains engaged with the target army and, for the remainder of this turn, your army cannot attempt to disengage from any army with which it is still engaged.
