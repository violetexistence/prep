# Engines of War
## Item 7
### 

**Category** army-tactic; 




_**Note**: Basic siege armies know Engines of War automatically, and must 'spend' their first tactic on it._

* * *

Siege engines cannot be outfitted with gear. They cannot attack [[Kingmaker Features/Engaged|Engaged]] armies. They are more difficult to destroy due to their higher hit points than other basic armies. A siege engine can attack and damage fortifications with its ranged attacks as part of the [[Kingmaker Features/Battle|Battle]] or [[Kingmaker Features/Overwhelming Bombardment|Overwhelming Bombardment]] actions.
