# Garrison Army
## 
### [[army]][[downtime]]

**Category** kingdom-activity; 




You move an army into a fortification and assign them to guard it. In order to garrison, the army must be located in a hex that contains a Refuge, Settlement, or Work Site. If you're garrisoning the army in a Refuge hex, attempt a basic `Defense check` check. If you're garrisoning the army in a settlement, attempt a basic `Politics check` check. If you're garrisoning the army in a Work Site hex, attempt a basic `Engineering check` check. This check's DC increases by 5 if the hex is not part of your kingdom, or by 10 if the location is part of an enemy kingdom.

**Critical Success** The army becomes fortified until it is deployed. Additionally, the efficiency of the garrisoning reduces this army's Consumption by 2 (to a minimum of 1) until it is deployed.

**Success** The army becomes fortified until it is deployed.

**Failure** The army becomes fortified until the next Kingdom turn begins, at which point you must use this activity again to maintain the fortified condition.

**Critical Failure** Your army clashes with local citizens, abuses their authority, lets their watchful readiness slack, and/or provokes confrontations where they are not needed. It does not become fortified, and you cannot attempt to garrison that army at this location again for 4 Kingdom turns. Increase Unrest by 1.
