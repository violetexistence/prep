# Manage Trade Agreements
## 
### [[commerce]][[downtime]]

**Category** kingdom-activity; 




You send agents out to attend to established trade agreements. Spend 2 RP per Trade Agreement you wish to manage. Then attempt a basic `Trade check` check. If you Managed Trade Agreements on the previous turn, increase this DC by 5.

**Critical Success** At the start of your next Kingdom turn, you gain 1 bonus Resource Die per trade agreement, and 1 Commodity of your choice per trade agreement (no more than half of these Commodities may be Luxuries).

**Success** As critical success, but you must choose between gaining Resource Dice or Commodities.

**Failure** You gain 1 RP per trade agreement at the start of your next turn.

**Critical Failure** You gain no benefit, as your traders and merchants met with bad luck on the road. You can't Manage Trade Agreements for 1 Kingdom turn.
