# Luhar

### 

**Category** deity; 




The old gods of the threefold sun were all but forgotten under the rule of [[Deities/Walkena|Walkena]]-but Luhar did not mind being forgotten. It is Walkena's undeath that she finds offensive, for she had crafted him such a beautifully perfect eternal sleep. Now he not only rejects her gift, but instills so much fear in his followers that their rest is fitful and brief.

**Religious Symbol** silver face in the setting sun
