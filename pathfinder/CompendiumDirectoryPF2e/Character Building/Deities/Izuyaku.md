# Izuyaku

### 

**Category** deity; 




The Strength and Serenity teaches that the most important objective of all mortals is to grow strong, so that they will survive the rigors of existence and live well. To Izuyaku, wellness is a balance between the needs of the body and the needs of the mind; they encourage the devout to regularly exercise their body but also to rest and relax for equal periods. Appropriately, Izuyaku is often depicted as a gentle-faced human with both masculine and feminine features reclining in a hot spring bath, their stocky build having both muscle and fat in equal measure.
