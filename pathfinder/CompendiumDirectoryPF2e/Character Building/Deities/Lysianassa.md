# Lysianassa

###

Lysianassa, Empress of the Torrent, is the elemental lord of currents, tides, and water. The benevolent lord of water patrols her plane as a powerful sailfish made of coral and streaked with mother of pearl, creating the ocean's currents in her wake.

Fearful of stagnancy after a long imprisonment, she races the waves of her own creation and encourages others to do the same.
