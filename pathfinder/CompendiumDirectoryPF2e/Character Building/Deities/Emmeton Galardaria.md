# Emmeton Galardaria

### 

**Category** deity; 




The halfling Emmeton Galardaria was once a common thief. Missing a hand from birth and abandoned as a child, the young Emmeton pledged to take from others everything they took for granted. He gained a reputation as a notorious highwayman, targeting merchants, nobles, and anyone who had become complacent with the gifts life had bestowed upon them. He often gave what he stole to others, earning fame among the less fortunate. As the legends of Emmeton's deeds continued to grow, the halfling began to take on a fraction of deific power. Some believe that Emmeton even stole the smallest of divine sparks from a god.
