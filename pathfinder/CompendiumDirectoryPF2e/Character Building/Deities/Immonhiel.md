# Immonhiel

### 

**Category** deity; 




Immonhiel is an angel and patron goddess of medicine, herbs, and healing. Her teachings are widespread throughout the Realm of the Mammoth Lords, even among followings who don't revere the goddess herself. Immonhiel's worship is particularly prevalent among followings who eschew magic, as her balms are entirely natural, using only alterations of the natural world to work miracles.

Immonhiel is a wanderer with no fixed home, much like the people of the Realm. She travels the Material Plane and the celestial realms to heal all those in need. When recovery isn't possible, Immonhiel remains with the dying as long as she can, offering them comfort through their final hours and medicine to ease their pain and sorrow. The Balm-Bringer's followers aim to walk this same selfless path.
