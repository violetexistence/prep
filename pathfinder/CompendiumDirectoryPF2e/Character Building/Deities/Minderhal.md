# Minderhal

### 

**Category** deity; 




Minderhal is both praised and scorned for his inflexibility and dedication to the status quo. The stone giant god of creation, giants, justice, and strength has a dwindling following, partially due to modern stone giants preferring to pay homage to the spirits of their ancestors over any gods. He instilled the belief that it is more honorable to exile yourself from a clan than to challenge superiors or existing traditions. Minderhal even went as far as encouraging the stone giants to accept being enslaved by the Thassilonians in exchange for political and magical might for himself, citing that it was only natural for the strong to subjugate the weak. Unsurprisingly, the moment the Thassilonian empire crumbled, so did faith in him.
