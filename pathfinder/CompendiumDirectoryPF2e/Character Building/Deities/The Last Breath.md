# The Last Breath

### 

**Category** pantheon; 




When all seems lost and no good reason for hope endures, some still resolve to fight their oppressors with every last ounce of strength. If they can't triumph, at least they'll make their foes pay dearly for victory. Whether inspired by Arazni's unyielding spirit, Milani's selflessness, or Calistria's thirst for vengeance, those who worship the Last Breath will never yield to tyrants, bullies, or abusers. Deeply self-reliant, these faithful rarely trouble the goddesses with lengthy prayers, merely asking for the strength to honor their convictions and the resolve to hold out despite all odds.

**Edicts** punish oppressors, resist those who would control you and others, turn others' power against them

**Anathema** give in to despair, surrender

**Areas of Concern** defiance, perseverance, and triumph over impossible odds
