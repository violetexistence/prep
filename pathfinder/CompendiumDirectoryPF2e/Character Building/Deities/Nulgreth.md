# Nulgreth

### 

**Category** deity; 




Nulgreth is one of the oldest orc deities, and is thought to be the origin of the ferocity that allows orcs to lash out in battle even when slain. If nothing else, he's certainly a prime example of that ferocity due to his constant rage and endless bloodlust. One need not worry about him scheming or plotting, just the sharp edge of his axe.
