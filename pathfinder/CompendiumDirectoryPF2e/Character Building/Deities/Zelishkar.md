# Zelishkar

### 

**Category** deity; 




The Bitter Flame was originally forged by Szuriel, the Rider of War, in her domain, the Cinder Furnace. She created Zelishkar as the embodiment of the funeral pyres that often follow in the wake of the wars she brings. The aggressive daemonic feline performed his duties so well that Szuriel promoted him to harbinger. Though Zelishkar continues to personify the most sadistic uses of fire, he holds a spark of resentment in his cores that he owes all that he is to Szuriel and schemes to someday supplant her.
