# Varg

### 

**Category** deity; 




Varg is another of the older orc deities and is said to be the first orc to learn how to forge blades. In life, Varg was a notably intelligent orc who focused exclusively on waging war. He recognized that the orcs' enemies were better equipped, better trained, and used better tactics in battle. He sought to learn these things, which allowed him to become a prestigious warlord. However, Varg's experience in combat was against other orcs. His overconfidence led him to lay "siege" to a walled city outside Belkzen. The siege didn't last long. In fact, Varg died quickly and his hold scattered.
