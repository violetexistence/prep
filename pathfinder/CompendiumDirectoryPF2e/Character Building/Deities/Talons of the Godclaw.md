# Talons of the Godclaw

### 

**Category** pantheon; 




There are often many differences between diving beings in a pantheon, but sometimes universal concepts can still bind them together. The Hellknight Order of the Godclaw extols the virtues of five gods—Abadar, Asmodeus Iomedae, Irori, and Torag—as seen through a particular lens of order and discipline. Though many priests of each individual faith called such views inconceivable or even heretical, the Godclaw's faithful nevertheless receive divine power from their shared patrons. Due to a simultaneous rise in enlistment by those of orc ancestry in the ranks and endorsement by those faithful to Torag, the god Uirch has replaced the dwarven deity in this pantheon's ranks.

**Pantheon Members** Abadar, Asmodeus, Iomedae, Irori, Uirch
