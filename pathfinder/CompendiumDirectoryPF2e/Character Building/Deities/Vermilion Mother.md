A rare few of those who've indulged in psychoactive plants have been met with horrifying visions of an old woman made of gnarled vines and roots, her sneering mouth full of fang-like thorns and pollen. Those unfortunate enough to meet Vermilion Mother are stalked in their sleep, choked nightly by her dream of a world overrun by plants and fungi. This sahkil tormentor cares little for those of flesh and blood, only that their bodies make for excellent fertilizer.
