# Ranginori

### 

**Category** deity; 




Ranginori, the Zephyrous Prince, is lord of air, welcome breezes, and thunderstorms. When he appears before mortals, Ranginori takes the form of an immense, lion-headed serpent spun from forbidding clouds, with hundreds of clawed feet and a mane that dances with lightning. The Zephyrous Prince has accumulated a small but loyal following in search of liberation, hope, and change for the multiverse. His realm on the Plane of Air is the Roaring Spark, a floating spiral of ruins that branch outward from a central crack of thunder.
