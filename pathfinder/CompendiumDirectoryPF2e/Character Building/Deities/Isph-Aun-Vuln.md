# Isph-Aun-Vuln

### 

**Category** deity; 




When not within a mutated host body, Isph-Aun-Vuln manifests as an incorporeal mass of roiling tentacles arrayed around a toothy maw. However, few see this true form, as the Feaster Within uses subterfuge and other cunning methods to erode the free will of mortals. She works to remove their capacity for sin and, eventually, their lives. Isph-Aun-Vuln has a fascination with mortal religions as she sees many churches as the tools of other gods to control their followers. Unlike most other qlippoth lords, she actively seeks worshippers to exert her influence over.
