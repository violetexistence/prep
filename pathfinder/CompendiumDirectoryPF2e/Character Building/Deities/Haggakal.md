# Haggakal

### 

**Category** deity; 




Haggakal is an ogre god, the offspring of a profane deity and a giant, the names of which have been either lost or intentionally scrubbed from the annals of time and even Bergelmir's tome, likely by the very beings who owned them. His hideous appearance is emphasized in all sorts of tales about him, regardless of whether the goal of the stories were to praise or disparage him. He is known as the god of ogres, darkness, illicit relationships and illicit deals among the few giants and even fewer ogres who worship him. His followers likewise become more unsightly the longer and more fervently they revere him. The only traits of Haggakal that are highlighted more than his unpleasant looks are his unholy strength and incredible cunning.
