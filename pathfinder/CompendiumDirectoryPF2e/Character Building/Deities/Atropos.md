# Atropos

### 

**Category** deity; 




Atropos, known among the psychopomp ushers as the Judge of Judges and the Last Sister, is Pharasma's youngest (and perhaps only) daughter, ruling over the Boneyard alongside her mother as the penultimate arbiter of mortal fates. The psychopomp manifests as a large nosoi with a shimmering, silver mask and a long tail of vivid peacock feathers, each bearing a living mortal eye: one feather with one eye for every soul past, present, and future to receive her judgment. When appearing in mortal guise, Atropos instead takes the form of a young human girl, and she often favors this form during appearances in her mother's court.
