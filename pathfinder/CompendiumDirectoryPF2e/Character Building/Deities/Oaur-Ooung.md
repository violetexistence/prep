# Oaur-Ooung

### 

**Category** deity; 




Oaur-Ooung is a massive, pale fungoid creature covered with blisters that endlessly give birth to more qlippoths, fueling their ranks for the war against demons. Some of her spawn drown within her impossibly deep oceanic realm and some she consumes upon birth, but countless others escape to the wider Outer Rifts. The Blistering Womb is also surrounded by smaller leviathans that can survive the toxic waters that protect her from demonic intrusions. Scholars believe that Cyth-V'sug, a qlippoth who became a demon lord, was spawned from one of her blisters. Most recently, she also gave birth to Nyuo-Ogh, one of the most recent qlippoth lords to rise.
