# The Spirit Wall

### 

**Category** covenant; 




As crusaders, naturalists, and descendants of Old Sarkoris struggle to reclaim the demon-haunted lands of what was the Worldwound, they turn to the Boundary of Strength for divine assistance in holding their territorial gains. The densest concentration of this covenant's worshippers resides in the town of Gundrun, the only stable settlement during the demonic occupation. Generally practical people, devotees care less about the nature of the Boundary of Strength than its effectiveness. This covenant is frequently invoked by night guards on patrol and those attempting to cleanse, salvage, or study the _wardstones_ that remain scattered around the Sarkoris Scar.
