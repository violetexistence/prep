# Velgaas

### 

**Category** deity; 




Many an idealist with great hopes to change the world has had their dreams realized by meeting a handsome stranger on the road. Velgaas, who might be mistaken for a nagaji with his scaled skin and forked tongue, takes great care to learn their altruistic desires, then carefully plants the seeds of destruction into their kind hearts. Charities become cesspools of corruption, laboratories convert into dens of torture, and peaceful protests spiral into mob violence.
