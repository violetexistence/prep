# Dammar

### 

**Category** deity; 




In the Age of Creation, the first time a soul was plucked from the River of Souls and returned to life, a psychopomp usher of life and resurrection emerged. Dammar the Denied is that first piece of resurrection magic made manifest, the psychopomp usher of life and journeys back from the Boneyard, and they ensure mortals don't make that journey too often or too easily. Alongside souls returning from the grave, Dammar presides over medicine, doctors who stave off death before it even arrives, alcohol (particularly, though not exclusively, used in medical preparations), and the unyielding tenacity of cockroaches and other insects who look upon death and refuse.
