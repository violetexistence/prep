# Baekho

### 

**Category** deity; 




Before he was a god, Baekho was a tiger who protected the forests of Tian Xia. Once, when he was gravely injured, he sheltered under the branches of a persimmon tree. As he experienced the changing of seasons beneath the tree's branches, an innate understanding of the world stirred within him. He awakened as a divine spirit with a human form with white hair, black-tipped white tiger ears, and deep blue tiger eyes. In his feline form, the fur that had once been an inferno of orange became a blinding white. His religious symbol, a snow-tipped persimmon branch laden with vibrant red-orange fruit, represents his awakening as a divine spirit who cherishes harmony.
