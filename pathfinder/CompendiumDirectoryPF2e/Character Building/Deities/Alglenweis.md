# Alglenweis

### 

**Category** deity; 




Called the Princess of the Rime by some, Alglenweis is the most popular Sarkorian deity in the Realm of the Mammoth Lords; though, since the opening of the Worldwound, her worship in Sarkoris has dwindled. Her ties to demonic entities like her father have placed her in a position of mistrust among Sarkorians who fear the return of a malevolent entity like Deskari.
