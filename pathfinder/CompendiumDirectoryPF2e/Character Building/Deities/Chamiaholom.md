# Chamiaholom

### 

**Category** deity; 




All mortals must die. This is the empirical truth championed by Chamiaholom, whose mission is to remind mortals that they will one day meet their end. Chamiaholom's form is a towering skeleton over 14 feet tall, wielding a staff made from the skulls of his victims. He is sometimes glimpsed around sites of tragedy and destruction and stalks those who've survived near-death experiences, terrifying witnesses who mistake him for death incarnate. Chamiaholom's followers wear dark paint on their faces to imitate the tormentor's skeletal visage as they travel around Golarion preaching their message of despair.
