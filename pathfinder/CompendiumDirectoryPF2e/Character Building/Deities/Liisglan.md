# Liisglan

### 

**Category** deity; 




All things, regardless of what they are, have inherent rules that govern their shape, structure, how they react to outside forces, and so on. Liisglan maintains these rules, keeping them contained within their allowed parameters so as to maintain the orderly structure of existence as a whole. If a creature were to suddenly break these rules to become unaffected by gravity or unable to interact with solid objects without some kind of outside influence, it could lead to ultimate disaster. The rules are in place for a reason, and the Forces Within does not suffer any who try to break these rules.
