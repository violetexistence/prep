# Xsistaid

Sometimes, desperate individuals suffering in the wake of plague and illness cry out to the cosmos for aid. Xsistaid is the chittering voice attempting to convince them that their continuing survival means shedding all pretenses of goodness, and preying upon whomever is in reach, growing strong by robbing others of their vitality. The Wriggling Wound cares not that there is no honor in becoming a parasite. Only the fact that it leads to a longer life matters.
