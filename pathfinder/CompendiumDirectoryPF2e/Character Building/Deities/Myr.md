# Myr

### 

**Category** deity; 




Myr, the Guide of Perfection, believed in honoring the past and respecting the wishes of the ancestors to follow an individual path forward. She taught that doing good deeds and living a charitable life honors those that came before and promotes a value in all life. While she promoted perfecting one's body, it wasn't her most significant edict. As society in Azlant prospered and grew, however, some took Myr's teachings at face value. They prayed to Myr for aid in physical perfection and ignored the values of her other teachings. This made Myr an unconventional, but popular, goddess for warriors and athletes.
