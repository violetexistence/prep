# Vavaalrav

### 

**Category** deity; 




Mortals have always needed ways to remember and honor their ancestors, and it was from this fundamental need the psychopomp usher Vavaalrav first imagined the spires and steeples of the Boneyard. Vavaalrav is the guardian of sacred places, and the chill of his breath and stillness of his presence is felt across every mausoleum, tomb, and other burial ground of the Universe. The Steeple's Skull does not tolerate when the sanctity of a holy site or the rest of the dead is disturbed, and his symbol is used by mortals to ward graves against foul spirits and grave robbers alike.
