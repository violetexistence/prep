# Ozranvial

### 

**Category** deity; 




Ozranvial is one's dearest friend until she isn't. The sahkil tormentor of despair and sadism isn't satiated by physical pain. Instead, she takes great pleasure in inserting herself into someone's life and pulling it apart until they are utterly broken by her machinations. The intimacy of a relationship makes its destruction all the more beautiful. Ozranvial will foster a relationship over years and even decades to enjoy the devastating outcome of her cruelty. She rules over the restless spirits created from the emotional damage she inflicts, tormenting them even after death.
