# Ssila'meshnik

### 

**Category** deity; 




Ssila'meshnik holds answers and freedom for all who call on them. They are the protean lord of fate, freedom, and paradox, and though they see the paths of all possible futures, the present is often out of reach. They exist as a flurry of shadowed afterimages, cast out across the infinite branches of time and choice. Though the Colorless Lord knows the twists and turns all lives take, those who call on them inevitably turn away from the answers the lord provides. Those who call on Ssila'meshnik always abandon their path.
