# Zarongel

### 

**Category** deity; 




Zarongel is the creator-god of dog killing, fire, and mounted combat. That barghests are profoundly dogshaped seems not to matter to either Zarongel or his followers. By all accounts, Zarongel appears to despise domesticated canines for becoming subservient to mortals. He's often depicted as a wolf-like barghest with his hair composed of burning fire. His mouth drips a magma-like substance that mimics molten saliva.
