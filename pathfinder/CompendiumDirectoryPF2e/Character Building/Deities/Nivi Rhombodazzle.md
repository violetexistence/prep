# Nivi Rhombodazzle

### 

**Category** deity; 




Goddess of gems, stealth, and gambling, Nivi Rhombodazzle is the ultimate high roller, said to have won her divinity from the dwarven god Torag in exchange for a particular gemstone. Nivi's love of gambling was born not from the rush of victory, but from the excitement of the bet itself, an attitude that ultimately brought her into a situation where her debts outweighed her charms. Keeping one step ahead of her creditors, Nivi fled beneath the earth and into the Darklands. Most of her adventures in the lightless lands are lost to time and history, but she ultimately emerged reborn as a goddess, hailed as the first of the deep gnomesâ€”uncanny underground gnomes with unique magical abilities and immunity to the dread Bleaching, a wasting curse which claims the lives of gnomes who succumb to boredom and ennui.
