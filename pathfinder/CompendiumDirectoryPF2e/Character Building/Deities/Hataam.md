# Hataam

### 

**Category** deity; 




The world flows too quickly, pushed into haste by innovation and technology. Civilizations rise and fall, bloodlines start and end, and even gods ascend and perish over time. The rapidity of life is distasteful to Hataam, who prefers the calmness of stagnant rivers and closed lakes. He often floats along murky waters as a mass of detritus and rotting limbs, leisurely watching for drownings and those who die of thirst.

**Sacred Animal** eel
