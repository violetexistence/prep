# Abraxas

### 

**Category** deity; 




Abraxas, the Master of the Final Incantation, is the demon lord of forbidden lore, magic, and snakes. Abraxas has an encyclopedic knowledge of magical formulas and destructive secrets, favoring those that inflict suffering and destruction. His Final Incantation is a word of power that can unravel the mightiest of spells and unmake even artifacts. He takes the form of a viperlegged humanoid with a fanged, deformed bird's head. Abraxas's cults are most prevalent in the Darklands of Golarion, but small circles devoted to him can be found in most major cities on the surface as well.
