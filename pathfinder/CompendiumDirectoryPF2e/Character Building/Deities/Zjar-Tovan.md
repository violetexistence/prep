# Zjar-Tovan

### 

**Category** deity; 




Zjar-Tovan is a name few are familiar with, as those who worship the Bladesoul are often mistaken for devotees of a god of the forge, such as Torag, or champions of a mighty military god, such as Iomedae. But to Zjar-Tovan, a weapon is more than just a tool. It is a statement against restriction or captivity, and a method to impart one's will against those who would resist embracing freedom of self-expression. To use a weapon is to make a choice, and as a sentient and living apparatus of war, Zjar-Tovan blesses those who use their tools with conviction, no matter their actions or cause.
