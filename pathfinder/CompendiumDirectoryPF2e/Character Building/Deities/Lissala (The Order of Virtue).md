# Lissala (The Order of Virtue)

### 

**Category** deity; 




Lissala, the Order of Virtue, has changed drastically from the times of ancient Azlant. Her teachings created the foundation of the Seven Virtues of Rule, later adopted by the realm of Thassilon. While those seven virtues held aspects of charity, humility, and love, Lissala encouraged her followers to focus more prominently on teachings of duty and strict adherence to her guidelines. She believed, and taught, that those who followed her teachings would be greatly rewarded.
