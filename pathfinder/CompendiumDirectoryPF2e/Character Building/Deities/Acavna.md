# Acavna

### 

**Category** deity; 




Acavna, the Shield, was one of humanity's fiercest protectors. Legends of her tactics and exploits spanned the entirety of the Azlanti Empire. Her most famous act of heroism led to her death during the events of Earthfall. Determined to protect her people, Acavna refused to stand down despite her partner Amaznen's pleas. She used her magic to move Golarion's moon in the way of the incoming meteor, absorbing most of the destructive blast. Her body fell from the sky and plunged into the planet's core. The Mordant Spire grew from her remains, and the elves who reside there claim to hear Acavna whispering to them.
