# Urazra

### 

**Category** deity; 




Faith in Urazra is relatively new, only coming about within the past few centuries. However, his following has grown rapidly among the young stone and marsh giants of a more violent incline. Even in the short amount of time that he has been a part of the giant pantheon, there have already been countless tales of his barbarity. In all of them, he is described as a blood-splattered stone giant man with a burly build, pauldrons fashioned from deer or moose skulls, and a jagged onyx-black greatsword with a length that rivals his height.
