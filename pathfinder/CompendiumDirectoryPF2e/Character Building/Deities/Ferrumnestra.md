# Ferrumnestra

### 

**Category** deity; 




Ferrumnestra, the Lady of Rust, is the elemental lord of metal, decay, and inevitability. Eternally wandering across the Plane of Metal, Ferrumnestra's touch is that of slow decline, the rust of ages that eats away at even the strongest of steel. While she has no particular desire to hasten any endings, she is there to consume the last crumbling detritus of its inevitable demise, leaving nonexistence in her wake. She keeps no permanent dwelling, always on the move as is her purpose; her few devotees usually follow her example, traveling across the world and destroying the wreckage of ancient ruins in their wake.
