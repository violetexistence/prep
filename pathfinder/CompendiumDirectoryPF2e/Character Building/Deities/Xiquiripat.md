# Xiquiripat

### 

**Category** deity; 




Trapped deep beneath the Black Pyramid of Xibalba lives an embodiment of destruction known as the Flying Scab. Few have seen Xiquiripat and lived to tell tales of their constantly shifting guise, which changes from waves of congealed blood to a knot of fanged lampreys to a heaving mass of matted hair. Though this god's form is fluid, their goals are less so, as Xiquiripat has had only one unbending desire since the dawn of their existence: to instill fear into every living thing they meet before condemning them to oblivion.
