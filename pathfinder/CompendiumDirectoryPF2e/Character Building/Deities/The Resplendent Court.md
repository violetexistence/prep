# The Resplendent Court

### 

**Category** pantheon; 




Whether it's a uniquely patterned shawl woven of the softest wool or a gem-studded brooch retrieved from a sunken temple, followers of the Resplendent Court take pride in their adornments and the efforts that went into procuring them. This disparate group of deities attracts followers who universally hold the belief that looking one's best is always worth the effort. Some critics dismiss the Resplendent Court as shallow materialists, but the faithful see the process of securing fine garments, altering them to fit, choosing the proper accessories, and donning them for the proper occasion as a significant ritual of self-expression and self-worth. To these worshippers, what someone wears is the outward expression of the inner identity, the ultimate declaration that they'll dress and act as they see fit.

**Edicts** adorn yourself with gems, search for rare clothing and accessories, use your clothing as a means of self-expression
