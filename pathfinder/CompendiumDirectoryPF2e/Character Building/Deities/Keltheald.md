# Keltheald

### 

**Category** deity; 




The Sunset Spires stands true, watching as the sun falls to greet the horizon each day. Just as they see the beauty in each sunset, they also see it in every creation that walks, swims, and flies upon Golarion. Keltheald spends most of their time traveling from one natural wonder to another, enjoying a different view every day. They most often take the form of a kestrel with vibrant wings the colors of a summer sunset, using this form to inconspicuously interact with the locations that they visit.
