# Shelyn

### 

**Category** deity; 




To know Shelyn is to love her, for Shelyn embodies love, as well as beauty, art, and music. She seeks to spread these pursuits across Golarion, teaching that they are the best way to find peace and happiness. Her passion is such that even the most basic attempts at art delight herâ€”the greatest marble sculptures of Taldor or kholo chants from the Mwangi Expanse are as beloved to her as the meanest sketches of a young orphan in Isger or the crude sand art of a Thuvian child. Beauty, for Shelyn, is a quality of being, not a specific set of characteristics, and she encourages people to find and accept many definitions of it.
