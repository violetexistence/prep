# Ananshea

### 

**Category** deity; 




Carnage and destruction are the domains of Ananshea. Their appetite for cruelty and violence can't be met by the simplicity of battle, and so they must torment their foes before they can be even somewhat satisfied with victory. The Skin that Walks on Teeth is as impulsive and untamed as the animals they reign over, but takes their time once the initial skirmish is over to inflict the most pain possible upon a captured opponent. Screams of pain are akin to music to Ananshea; they despise long stretches of time without their favorite melody, so they are constantly on the hunt for prey.
