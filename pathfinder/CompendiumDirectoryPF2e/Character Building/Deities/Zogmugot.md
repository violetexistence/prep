# Zogmugot

### 

**Category** deity; 




The brains of the four goblin creator-gods, Zogmugot is a goddess with a baleful temper and obsessive temperament. Depictions of Lady Lastbreath show her as a barghest with sea-green fur. Always watching with her colorful sea-glass eyes, goblins risk much by gaining her attention. She dislikes being bothered by mortal petitioners, and if she decides that a goblin should have figured out a problem on their own, she is quick to unleash her wrath. Zogmugot is in charge of deciding whether a goblin drowns in water or is washed back ashore, and she viciously drowns her victims when she's in a bad mood. Most goblins ritually placate her for this reason, while followers desperate to get her attention go to the depths of the sea and attempt to drown themselves.
