# Thremyr

### 

**Category** deity; 




Thremyr is a mountainous, ancient being with a long, full beard and hair of salt, a stout body of frigid ice, and a set of chilling blue gems for eyes. The earliest available records of the god tell the tale of his awakening during Earthfall as the meteorite landed on Golarion, tearing open the Inner Sea. Anything prior to that is currently undocumented or lost as a result of this cataclysmic event.
