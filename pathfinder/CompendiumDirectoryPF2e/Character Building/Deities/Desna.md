# Desna

### 

**Category** deity; 




Desna is one of the oldest goddesses, a divinity who predates mortal life, yet one who has come to adore it for its beauty, capacity for diversity, and pursuit of growth. According to legend, Desna placed the stars in the night sky of the Universe, an act that Sarenrae found so inspiring that she chose her favorite stars to become the suns of countless worlds. When mortal life rose on those worlds, Desna's first gift to them was a beacon of hope, for she made the first star and her home, Cynosure, the brightest in the sky, giving those on the countless worlds something to gaze upon, to use in navigation, and to inspire their dreams.
