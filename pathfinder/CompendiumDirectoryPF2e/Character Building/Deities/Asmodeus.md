# Asmodeus

### 

**Category** deity; 




The many titles of Asmodeus—the Dark Prince, the First, the Lord of Darkness and Law to name a few—suit this ruler of Hell. The God-Fiend's concerns include contracts, tyranny, pride, and oppression. He maintains that a supreme order exists with him at the top, so he strives to bend mortal souls to eventually bring them all under his sway. When people believe they deserve power and wealth, and are willing to undertake any means to acquire them, one of Asmodeus's devils will be there to broker a deal that leads to that mortal's damnation.
