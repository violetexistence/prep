# Treerazer

### 

**Category** deity; 




Treerazer, the Lord of the Blasted Tarn, first came to Golarion thousands of years ago after being forced to flee the Outer Rifts when his attempt to seize control of the demonic realm of Jeharlu from his father Cyth-V'sug failed spectacularly. Reduced in power to that of a nascent demon lord, Treerazer spent some time lying low before turning his attention to the abandoned elven lands of Kyonin. When his attempt to corrupt that realm resulted in the elves' return to defend their home and oppose his pestilent influence, Treerazer was forced to retreat again to the depths of a fetid swampland known as Tanglebriar.
