# Yamasoth

### 

**Category** deity; 




Yamasoth appears as a nightmarish octopus with a multitude of tentacles, each ending in a method of inflicting pain. His body is a single massive mouth filled with sharp teeth and stinging tongues. Eyes dot his form, and one huge red eye sits within his throat. Like all qlippoth lords, Yamasoth seeks to eradicate demons by eliminating sin in mortals, but his methods involve corrupting powerful leaders until they doom their kingdoms and performing terrible fleshwarping experiments on hapless victims to release monsters upon civilization. Yamasoth has a grudging respect tempered with disdain for Lamashtu for her hand in creating monsters but hates almost all other deities.
