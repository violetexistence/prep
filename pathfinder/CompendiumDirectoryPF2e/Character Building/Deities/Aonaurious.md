# Aonaurious

### 

**Category** deity; 




Aonaurious appears as a sleek insectile creature with an obsidian carapace and razor-sharp claws that drip with blood. A quartet of unblinking eyes are spaced evenly around his head so that he can see in all directions and dozens of legs provide him the speed to pursue any prey. Called the Enigma Clot, he is the most violently aggressive qlippoth lord, always ready to wade into battles against demons and mortals alike. He grants no quarter, expects none in return and will mercilessly chase any who flee from a fight until he can tear them to pieces.
