# Zipacna

### 

**Category** deity; 




The lazy but violent Zipacna is one the largest sahkil tormentors, resembling a massive caiman with four eyes and unnervingly human hands. He prefers to lounge in the lusher regions of Xibalba being pampered by the unfortunate souls he's forcefully inducted into his service, doling out vicious punishments when his demands aren't met. Even the other sahkil tormentors avoid testing his fury, as his penchant for destructive violence overwhelms everything in his path.
