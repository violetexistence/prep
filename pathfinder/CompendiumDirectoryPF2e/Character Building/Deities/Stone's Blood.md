# Stone's Blood

###

Many dwarves choose to venerate the entire pantheon of dwarven gods as one, colloquially known as Stone's Blood. These deities function as a family unit, with Torag as the patriarch. They get along as well as any family might, disagreeing on many matters but always cooperating for the good of the whole. Worship of Stone's Blood includes all aspects of dwarven life, and devotees are among the strongest pillars of any dwarven community.
