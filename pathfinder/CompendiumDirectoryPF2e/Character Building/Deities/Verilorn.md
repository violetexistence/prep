# Verilorn

### 

**Category** deity; 




Verilorn, Custodian of Oak and Ash, is the elemental lord of wood, cultivation, and forestry. He tends to his fields and gardens with exact precision, ensuring that every leaf and branch is of perfect size, shape, and position. While he once allowed his creations to grow with more abandon, incursions from the other elemental lords left Verilorn determined to create order and security, abandoning the green flexibility of his youth for the hardened bark of troubled wisdom. His creations now are physically perfect, but ideologically cold.
