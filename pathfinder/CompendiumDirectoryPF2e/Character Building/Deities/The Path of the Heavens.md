# The Path of the Heavens

### 

**Category** pantheon; 




The Path of the Heavens is well known to those who make their way in Golarion. Looking down from above, these deities help travelers and voyagers find their path. Their guidance can be literal, or for others, more spiritualâ€”some worshippers seek to know the progress of Sarenrae (the sun), Tsukiyo (the moon), and Desna (the stars) and through this knowledge gain enlightenment. Nocticula, the last member of the pantheon, for her part uses the cover of the darkness, the gaps in between the others, to shelter travelers and outcasts. Some who worship her as their primary deity in the pantheon seek to use the void between the stars to defend voyagers on the road. Though this is frowned upon by the other members of the Path of the Heavens, it does not seem to disrupt the harmony between the gods.
