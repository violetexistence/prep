# Atreia

### 

**Category** deity; 




Responsible for fire, purification, and radiance, Atreia the Lambent King is the benevolent elemental lord of fire. When the multiverse was young, Atreia soared across the Plane of Fire as a triple-headed ibis, with wings that burned and eyes of flame, routing evil from the plane. Though his strength was weakened from a long imprisonment, he maintained worship among some groups of munsahirs on the Plane of Fire for his dominion over protection and life-giving fire. With his return, his worship now also extends to a few circles of mortals who hold the discovery and purification of evil above all other causes.
