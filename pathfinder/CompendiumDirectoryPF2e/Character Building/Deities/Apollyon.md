# Apollyon

### 

**Category** deity; 




The Prince of Plagues seized power for himself after the disappearance of the previous Rider of Pestilence by obsessively eliminating all potential rivals. Apollyon commands his vast army of leukodaemons to spread oblivion like a virus. He wastes no time on trivial acts of violence and lacks the patience to wait for longterm schemes to come to fruition. Instead, his plagues carry oblivion through cities like lightning, decimating entire kingdoms in the span of a few days. His greatest creations have been diseases that corrupt the soul itself, ensuring that my Lady must send his victims to Abaddon once they've succumbed.
