When the Universe was young, Pharasma watched mortals as they lived, and when their day arrived, she saw mortality's love for life push them to defy the cycle and refuse death. Pharasma raised up an asp, reshaping them into a new psychopomp usher whose venom—age—would flow through all mortal veins, draining away their memories, their passions, and their vitality, until, when their time comes to its close, they are ready for death's embrace.
