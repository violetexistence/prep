# Upion and Warrik

### 

**Category** deity; 




When Upion received his myth-speaking, he politely thanked the cyclopes but refused to seek divinity or hear their whole prophecy. To do so would mean outliving his lover, Warrik, by decades or even centuries. Instead, the pair continued their military careers, believing it better to find immortality together on the front lines than chase some goal they couldn't share. Both appeared to perish in the Battle of Tesikon Heights, only to arise imbued with mythic power to turn the tide of battle. Since then, Upion and Warrik have acted as a single hero-god, seemingly able to grant spells only when together. The pair encourage camaraderie, neither expecting nor disparaging those whose loyalty develops into consensual romance.
