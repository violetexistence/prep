# Onos

### 

**Category** deity; 




Onos was the Azlanti deity of elements, embassies, and extraplanar travel. Often difficult for mortals to fully understand, the God of Many Doors exists outside of any personality expected by a deity and speaks with its followers in direct and emotionless ways. Priests of Onos do their best to behave in a similar manner. Slow to anger and mild-mannered, priests of Onos often served as mediators in times of conflict.
