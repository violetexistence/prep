# The Devourer

### 

**Category** deity; 




The Devourer is a new deity: an embodiment of ruin on a galactic scale, born from the acts of other deities in ages long past. Thanks to Gorum and Torag, a sliver of the deity Rovagug was bound inside Gorum's armor, turning the deity of war into an eternal prison for the Rough Beast. Inside Gorum, the sliver festered, changing and warping into something new. Following the events of the Godsrain and Gorum's demise, the sliver managed to escape its prison and ascend into the cosmos as its own being, the Devourer.
