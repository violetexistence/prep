Shortly after orcs arrived on the surface of Golarion, it's said that Rull challenged thunder to a fight. He climbed a mountain peak during a thunderstorm and yelled out his Deathright to a spirit of lightning. He was struck by a tremendous bolt of lightning on the spot and died. During the ensuing Crucible, Rull claims to have won by consuming the lightning spirit he had challenged, and that it now lives within him and is under his control.
