# Whispering Way

### 

**Category** philosophy; 




These cultists believe undeath is the truest form of existence, and life is meant to be spent in preparation for transition to a more glorious unlife after death.

**Areas of Concern** undeath, lichdom, secrets

**Edicts** seek the perfection of undeath, cleanse the world of the living, master the magical secrets of life and death

**Anathema** speak the secrets of the Whispering Way above a whisper, write down the philosophies of the Whispering Way, act irrationally due to concerns for the living
