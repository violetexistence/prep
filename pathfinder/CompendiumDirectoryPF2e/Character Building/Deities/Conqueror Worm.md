# Conqueror Worm

### 

**Category** deity; 




Individual conqueror worms are lesser deities, capable of granting spells to those who worship them. Often, the conqueror worm's clerics are the only ones in its vast network of hidden agents and depraved cults with an inkling as to the nature of the malevolent creature pulling the strings. While individual conqueror worms have different edicts, anathema, and favored weapons befitting their personalities, the following is common among conqueror worms

**Edicts** manipulate those in power, foster psychic abilities, endorse unjust laws

**Anathema** enact hasty schemes, tell the truth except to nurture a larger lie, reveal those higher in the conqueror worm's network
