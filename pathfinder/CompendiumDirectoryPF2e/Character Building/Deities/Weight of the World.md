# Weight of the World

### 

**Category** pantheon; 




All things gravitate toward equilibrium, but this is not the same thing as balance. Nature is constantly shifting and changing. When new growth becomes old, it is broken down to become raw materials for new things once more. Those who are closest to the land know this the best. Volcanoes erupt and destroy, but then make the earth on and near their slopes so much more fertile afterward... until they erupt anew.

People who have studied or survived natural disasters or extreme weather events also know this far too well. By making sacrifices and offerings to the deities who embody primal forces and changes, they gain a better understanding of how to harness these energies for themselves. Those who venerate the Weight of the World are usually spellcasters, but sometimes scholars who look for patterns and meaning in the natural world's cycles also seek a bit of divine inspiration in their quest for knowledge.
