# Ongalte

### 

**Category** deity; 




When cyclopes and Iblydans first joined forces, they lived as equals. However, humanity gradually overshadowed their giant colleagues, with cyclopes uplifting hero-gods but rarely becoming divine themselves. As she trained in the art of myth-speaking, the cyclops Ongalte became bitter at her species' decline and humans' ascendancy. Without change, her people would eventually dwindle and vanish entirely. She enacted her own myth-speaking, soon after which she collapsed the temple, crushing her and many others beneath the rubble. Yet moments later, she emerged unscathed and ascendant.

Since then, Ongalte has haunted Iblydos as a hero-god of deicide. She has killed at least three hero-gods, and she may have orchestrated others' demises without formally claiming responsibility. Her greatest obstacles are the city-states themselves; surviving hero-gods rarely leave their urban sanctuaries, so Ongalte relies on slander and disgrace to force these demigods into the open.

Ongalte has only elevated one hero-god other than herself: her lieutenant Ytildos. His betrayal decades ago confirmed her belief that all hero-gods must die.
