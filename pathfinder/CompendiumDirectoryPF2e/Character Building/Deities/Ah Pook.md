# Ah Pook

### 

**Category** deity; 




Also known as the Destroyer, Lord of Night and Fear, and the Twisting Skull, Ah Pook is a cruel and cunning deity who has reveled in the suffering of mortals for as long as anyone can remember. However, rare is the occasion when the Destroyer causes direct harm to his victims. Instead, he relishes in misleading them, offering them apparent relief from their problems and concerns while inflaming their fears and insecurities, prompting them to act in ways that cause them to fall into a downward spiral of self-destruction. Ah Pook never forces someone to take a particular course of action, for their misery is more sublime if they brought it upon themselves.
