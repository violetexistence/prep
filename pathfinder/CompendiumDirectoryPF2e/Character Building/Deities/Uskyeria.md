# Uskyeria

### 

**Category** deity; 




Whether consciously or not, every successful hunter knows that a balance must be struck between observation and action, preparation and instinct, life and death. Taking more from the land than what is sustainable entices predators to be bolder, possibly turning the hunter into the hunted. Those who seek harmony while they live off the land give deference to Uskyeria, who urges her followers to embrace this equilibrium. Death is a natural part of life. Predators hunt prey. Those who are best suited to do so will survive. Those who don't still feed the circle of life.
