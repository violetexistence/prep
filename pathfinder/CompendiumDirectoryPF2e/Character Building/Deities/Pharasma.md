# Pharasma

### 

**Category** deity; 




Before there was time, or even a sun or moon by which to measure it, there was a beginning. That beginning had an end, which led to another fresh start. This spiral of time winds out forever, glimmering in the space between spaces. At the center of that spiral sits the Spire, and atop that Spire sits Pharasma, the Lady of Graves, goddess of death, birth, fate, and prophecy. The Lady of Graves is often depicted in a triptych of her three formsâ€”an older midwife with silver hair pulled back into a harsh braid to keep it out of her face, a young prophet with wild hair that frames her face, and a tall, regal woman in black robes atop a throne of skulls, holding an hourglass full of blood red sand. Across all forms, Pharasma's silver hair, ashen skin, and white eyes are a constant.
