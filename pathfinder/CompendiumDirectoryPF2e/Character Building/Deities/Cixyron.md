# Cixyron

### 

**Category** deity; 




The Furious Thunder claims purview over electricity, gunpowder, and poisonous metals, all concrete manifestations of a consuming violence that doesn't discriminate. Such engines of destruction can just as easily turn against the hands that wield them. Petitioners of Cixyron are often arms dealers, constructing instruments of war for whomever will buy them. Sometimes such implements are sold to both sides of a conflict, causing battles to drag on longer than they would naturally. Cixyron doesn't care about the results of such conflicts or whether his followers get swept up in the hostilities, only that they leave shattered bodies in their wakes.
