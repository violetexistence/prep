# Cthulhu

### 

**Category** deity; 




Slumbering in drowned R'lyeh, the Dreamer in the Deep is a towering monstrosity whose many tentacles reach out beyond the physical, influencing the minds of sapient beings across the Universe through their dreams. Artists and visionaries, whose creativity makes them especially susceptible to Cthulhu's influence, may wake to find themselves unconsciously inspired by memories they cannot fully grasp. As a result, countless works of art and philosophy have been produced by mortals that touch upon aspects of this Great Old One, each subtly lengthening the god's reach.
