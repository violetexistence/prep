# Thuskchoon

###

Thuskchoon is a towering slug with numerous limbs and ravenous maws that slithers through the Outer Rifts, consuming all that he finds. In the wake of his near-mindless devastation, his mouths leaves swaths of disgusting tar. Sometimes, Everglutton stumbles across a portal to another plane, though these changes of scenery barely register with the qlippoth lord. He simply continues to indulge his insatiable hunger, uncaring of what (or who) he eats.
