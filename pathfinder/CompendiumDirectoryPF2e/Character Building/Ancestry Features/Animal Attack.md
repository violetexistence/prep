# Animal Attack
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** ancestryfeature; 




Your heritage gives you a special unarmed attack instead of the fist unarmed attack humanoids typically gain. This attack is in the brawling weapon group. Work with your GM to determine which one you have, using the type of animal you are and suggestions in your heritage for guidance. For example, you might choose a beak, talon, or wing for an eagle, a fist or tail for a monkey, or a tongue or jaws for a toad.
