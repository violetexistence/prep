# Keen Eyes
## Feat 1
### [[halfling]]

**Category** ancestryfeature; 




Your eyes are sharp, allowing you to make out small details about [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] or even [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]] creatures that others might miss. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus when using the [[Actions/Seek|Seek]] action to find [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] or [[Conditions/Undetected|Undetected]] creatures within 30 feet of you. When you target an opponent that is concealed from you or hidden from you, reduce the DC of the flat check to 3 for a concealed target or 9 for a hidden one.
