# Wings
## Feat 1
### [[strix]]

**Category** ancestryfeature; 




All strix possess powerful wings. While not all strix focus on honing their flying skills, a strong flap of their wings allows strix to travel longer distances when jumping.

When [[Actions/Leap|Leaping]] horizontally, you move an additional 5 feet. You don't automatically fail your checks to [[Actions/High Jump|High Jump]] or [[Actions/Long Jump|Long Jump]] if you don't Stride at least 10 feet first. In addition, when you make a Long Jump, you can jump a distance up to 10 feet further than your Athletics check result, though still with the normal maximum of your Speed. Additionally, you take no damage from falling, no matter what distance you fall.
