# Sunlight Healing
## Feat 1
### [[conrasu]]

**Category** ancestryfeature; 




A conrasu can enter a meditative, healing state as a 10-minute activity when exposed to direct sunlight, in which case they recover 1d8 healing Hit Points. At 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, this healing increases by 1d8.

Once a conrasu has recovered Hit Points in this way, they are temporarily immune to further uses of Sunlight Healing for 1 day.
