# Awakened Mind
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** ancestryfeature; 




Awakening altered your mind. You are no longer an animal, but you can still ask questions of, receive answers from, and use the Diplomacy skill with animals of your kind. By remembering your instincts, you can allow yourself to be affected by spells and other effects as though you were an animal.
