# Constructed Body
## Feat 1
### [[automaton]]

**Category** ancestryfeature; 




Your physiological needs are different than those of living creatures. You don't need to eat or drink. You don't need to sleep, but you still need a daily period of rest. During this period of rest, you must enter a recuperating standby state for 2 hours, which is similar to sleeping except you are aware of your surroundings and don't take penalties for being [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]]. Much like with sleeping, if you go too long without entering your standby state, you become [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]] and can't recover until you enter standby for 2 hours.
