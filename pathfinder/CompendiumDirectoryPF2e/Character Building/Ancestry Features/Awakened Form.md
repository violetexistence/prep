# Awakened Form
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** ancestryfeature; 




Awakening altered your form, enabling you to speak verbally and stand on two legs. You can wear, hold, wield, and use items. Which limbs you use to manipulate items and how many are determined by you and your GM, but for the rules you function like a humanoid with two hands.
