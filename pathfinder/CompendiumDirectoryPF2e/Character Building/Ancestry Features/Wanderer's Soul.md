# Wanderer's Soul
## Feat 1
### [[samsaran]]

**Category** ancestryfeature; 




Your soul is especially able to return to the cycle of reincarnation. When you're the subject of [[Spells/Raise Dead|Raise Dead]], [[Spells/Reincarnate|Reincarnate]], or a similar ritual that would return you to life, the primary caster uses the outcome one degree of success better than their roll. You always return to life as a samsaran, even if the ritual would reincarnate you into a body of a different ancestry.
