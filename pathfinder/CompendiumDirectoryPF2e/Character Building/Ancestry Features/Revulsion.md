# Revulsion
## Feat 1
### 

**Category** ancestryfeature; 




You can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of brandished garlic or a religious symbol of a non-evil deity. A creature must Interact to brandish garlic or a religious symbol for 1 round (similar to Raising a Shield). If you involuntarily come within 10 feet of an object of your revulsion, you gain the [[Conditions/Fleeing|Fleeing]] condition, running from the subject of your revulsion until you end an action beyond 10 feet of it. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of your revulsion, you can attempt a `DC 25 Will check` save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, you overcome your revulsions for 1d6 rounds, or 1 hour on a critical success.
