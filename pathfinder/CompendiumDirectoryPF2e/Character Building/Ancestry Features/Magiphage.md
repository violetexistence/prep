The various nodes throughout your body draw in latent magic from the world around you. You don't need to eat or drink unless you're in an especially magic-poor environment (such as the Mana Wastes). Choose what tradition of magic you most consumed as a larva; this type of magic has become so ingrained in your body that it changes the tradition of all surki spells and magical actions to that tradition.
