# Melixie

### 






You have the features of a bee, butterfly, or other insect that loves sweets. You can ask questions of and receive answers from arthropods (insects, spiders, scorpions, crabs, and similar invertebrate animals), as well as use Diplomacy to Make an Impression on and Request things of them. Most bees, butterflies, moths, and beetles have an [[Conditions/Indifferent|Indifferent]] or [[Conditions/Friendly|Friendly]] starting attitude toward you and give you time to make your case, though other arthropods react to you like any other adventurer.
