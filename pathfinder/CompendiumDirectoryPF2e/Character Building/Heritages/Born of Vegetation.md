# Born of Vegetation

### [[yaoguai]]






You were a plant or fungi until the rain gifted you a mind. You gain your choice of the plant or fungus trait.

*   **Humanoid Form** With fresh vegetation, you can better aid those in need. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Medicine checks to [[Actions/Administer First Aid|Administer First Aid]].
*   **Yaoguai Form** When anyone uses the Medicine skill to [[Actions/Treat Wounds|Treat your Wounds]], add your level to the Hit Points you regain from that treatment. Additionally, the creature attempting the check gains a +1 circumstance bonus if you have the plant trait and are in bright light, or the fungus trait and are in darkness.
