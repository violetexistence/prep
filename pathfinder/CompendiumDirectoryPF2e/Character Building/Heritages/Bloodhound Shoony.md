# Bloodhound Shoony

### 






Your ancestors were famous trackers, and you carry in your blood that same gift of the hunt.

You gain a special sense: imprecise scent with a range of 30 feet. This means you can use your sense of smell to determine the location of a creature, but it remains [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]].

In addition, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Survival checks to [[Actions/Track|Track]] creatures that you have previously sensed with your scent.
