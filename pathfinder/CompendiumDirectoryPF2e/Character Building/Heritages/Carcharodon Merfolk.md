# Carcharodon Merfolk

### 






As a fearsome shark merfolk, your lower body is similar to that of one of the apex predators of the ocean. Like a shark, you can smell blood from quite a distance. You gain scent as an imprecise sense with a range of 30 feet. However, you can smell spilled blood at a range of 120 feet in the air and 500 feet in the water.
