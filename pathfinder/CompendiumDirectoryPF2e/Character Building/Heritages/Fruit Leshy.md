# Fruit Leshy

### 






Your body continually produces small fruits imbued with primal magic. At dawn each day, a new fruit ripens. You or an ally can remove this fruit as an Interact action. If a living creature that can derive sustenance from fruit consumes it as an Interact action within the next hour, they regain 1d8 vitality healing Hit Points, plus an additional 1d8 Hit Points for every 2 of your levels beyond 1st. This effect has the healing and vitality traits.
