# Jinxed Halfling

### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")






You were born with a strange blessing: bereft of the typical halfling luck, you can instead manipulate the fortunes of others. You can never take the [[Feats/Halfling Luck|Halfling Luck]] feat, and you gain the [[Actions/Jinx|Jinx]] action.
