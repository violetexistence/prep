# Keen-Venom Vishkanya

### 






You're practiced with using your venom in combat, allowing you to employ your venom at a moment's notice. Your [[Actions/Envenom|Envenom]] action doesn't trigger reactions that normally trigger on a manipulate action. Additionally, you gain the [[Actions/Venom Draw|Venom Draw]] action.
