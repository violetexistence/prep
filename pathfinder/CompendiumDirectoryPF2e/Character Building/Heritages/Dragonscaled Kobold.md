# Dragonscaled Kobold

### 






Thanks to your warren's association with a dragon, your scales are sturdier than other kobolds'. You gain 10 Hit Points from your ancestry instead of 6. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saves against dragon breath, effects with the sleep trait, and effects that would make you [[Conditions/Paralyzed|Paralyzed]].
