# Born of Celestial

### [[yaoguai]]






You were once a powerful celestial before an escape or great punishment left you trapped in a mortal shell, with only vague memories and limited power. Due to your residual divine power, the tradition of any spells or magical abilities you gain from a yaoguai heritage or ancestry feat is divine instead of its normal tradition (usually occult).

*   **Humanoid Form** Fragments of divine memory still litter your mind. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Religion checks.
*   **Yaoguai Form** Celestial power flows through you. Choose one cantrip from the divine spell list. You can cast this spell as an innate divine cantrip at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell rank equal to half your level rounded up.
