# Impersonator Android

### 






Your body was augmented with processes and an appearance intended to blend in with humans more easily.

You become trained in Deception (or another skill if you're already trained in Deception). You don't require a disguise kit when attempting Deception checks to [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] a human.

In addition, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to Impersonate checks to pretend that you're a human version of yourself, rather than an android. This bonus doesn't apply to other checks to Impersonate humans.
