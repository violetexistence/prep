# Strong Oak

### 






Most ghorans have bodies of pliable vines and tough stems, but you're covered in sturdy, rough bark and your legs are stable as roots. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus on your Fortitude or Reflex DC against attempts to [[Actions/Grapple|Grapple]] or [[Actions/Trip|Trip]] you. This bonus also applies to saving throws against effects that would [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grab]] you, [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrain]] you, or knock you [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]. You also gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Acrobatics checks to [[Actions/Balance|Balance]].
