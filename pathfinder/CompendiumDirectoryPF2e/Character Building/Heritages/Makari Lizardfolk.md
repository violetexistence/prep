# Makari Lizardfolk

### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[lizardfolk]]






You have a trunk-like snout and a connection to the divine. The tradition of any spells or magical abilities you gain from a lizardfolk heritage or ancestry feat is divine instead of its normal tradition (usually primal).

You gain your choice of the [[Spells/Divine Lance|Divine Lance]] or [[Spells/Forbidding Ward|Forbidding Ward]] cantrips, which you can cast as a divine innate cantrip at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell rank equal to half your level rounded up. When you cast this cantrip, it loses the manipulate trait, as you cast purely by roaring and flaring your trunk.
