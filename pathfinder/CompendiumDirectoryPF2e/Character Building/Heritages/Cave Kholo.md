# Cave Kholo

### 






Storytellers spin ancient tales claiming that kholo lived in caves and underground before most of your kind ventured into the light. You're a throwback to these ancients, with a broad chest and markings that resemble short black slashes instead of spots. Your eyes are developed to see perfectly in the dark, a valuable advantage to your clan. You gain darkvision.
