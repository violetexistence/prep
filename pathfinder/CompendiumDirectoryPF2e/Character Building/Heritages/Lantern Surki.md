# Lantern Surki

### 






The nodes in your abdomen are particularly luminous. You can use an Interact action to shed light from your abdomen in a 20-foot radius (and dim light for the next 20 feet). This is a magical light effect with a counteract rank equal to half your level rounded up. You can change the color of the light or extinguish it with another Interact action.

*   **Evolution** Your abdominal nodes have evolved into a pair of secondary limbs that project a magical focusing lens. You gain the [[Actions/Lantern Beam|Lantern Beam]] action.
*   **Evolution** Secondary light emitters grow from your shoulder nodes that flash in time with your lantern. You gain the [[Actions/Lantern Strobe|Lantern Strobe]] action.
