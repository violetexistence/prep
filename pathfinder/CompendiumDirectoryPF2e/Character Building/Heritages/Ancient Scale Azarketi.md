# Ancient Scale Azarketi

### 






Your lineage stems from azarketis who remain dedicated to their deep-sea roots. Divorced from land society, you're a foreigner to any world above a thousand fathoms deep. You gain darkvision.

Your body is dotted with phosphorescent spots that emit a guiding light and help you communicate. The spots - located primarily on your face, arms, and hands - illuminate a 10-foot radius around you with dim light. You can activate, deactivate, or change the arrangement of lights as an action, which has the concentration trait.
