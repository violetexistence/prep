# Wishborn Poppet

### 






You were wished to life, either by a powerful spellcaster or by the earnest desire of an innocent person who loved you very much. You're living proof that a hopeful spirit can overcome any obstacle. If you roll a success on a saving throw against an emotion or fear effect, you get a critical success instead.
