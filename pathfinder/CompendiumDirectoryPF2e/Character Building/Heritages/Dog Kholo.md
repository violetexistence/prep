# Dog Kholo

### 






You're a nimble-bodied kholo with a prehistoric, almost dog-like build. Though you typically move like a quadruped, you can still stand and fight like a biped, allowing you to use all equipment normally. If you have both hands free, you can increase your Speed to 30 feet as you run on all fours.
