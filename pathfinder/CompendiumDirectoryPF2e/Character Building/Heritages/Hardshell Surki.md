# Hardshell Surki

### 






Your carapace is much denser than that of other surkis, offering you a suit of your very own armor. Your carapace is medium armor in the plate armor group that grants a +4 item bonus to AC, a Dex cap of +1, a check penalty of –2, a Speed penalty of –5 feet, a Strength value of +3, and has the comfort trait. You can never wear other armor or remove your carapace. You can etch armor runes onto your carapace.

*   **Evolution** The magical circulatory system that runs between your nodes has become a reinforcing network that strengthens your carapace with magical energy. If you're struck by a critical hit that deals physical damage, you can use your reaction to attempt a `DC 17 Flat check`. If successful, the attack becomes a normal hit.
*   **Evolution** Your abdominal nodes can project a field around you that guards you against the type of magic you're most familiar with. You gain the [[Actions/Dampening Harmonics|Dampening Harmonics]] action.
