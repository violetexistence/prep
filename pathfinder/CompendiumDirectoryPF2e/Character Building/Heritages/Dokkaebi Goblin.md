# Dokkaebi Goblin

### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[goblin]]






Your ancestors mastered illusion-based magic, giving you an innate understanding of it. You can cast [[Spells/Figment|Figment]] as an innate occult cantrip at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell rank equal to half your level rounded up. You also gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Will saves against illusions.
