# Respite of Loam and Leaf

### [[plant]][[yaksha]]






You swore a vow to preserve the very foundation of sanctuary: the great earth and all that grows upon it. Your vow grants you the land's spiritual power; you gain one cantrip from the primal spell list. You can cast this spell as an innate primal spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell rank equal to half your level rounded up. Your roots in the world grant you the plant trait.
