# Deny the Firstborn Pursuit

### [[yaksha]]






You swore a vow to shelter others from the First World's cruelties. Wise to fey's mind-affecting abilities, your vow grants mental resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1), and a +2 circumstance bonus to Nature checks to Recall Knowledge about fey.

* * *

**Additional Edict** confront cruel fey you encounter (as long as you have a reasonable chance of success)
