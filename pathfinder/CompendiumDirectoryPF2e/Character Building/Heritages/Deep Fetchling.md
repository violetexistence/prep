# Deep Fetchling

### 






Your predecessors dwelled in the Shadow Plane's deepest, most treacherous regions. You might cast a denser shadow, have a slower pulse, or find comfort in the embrace of darkness. You gain cold or void resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1), chosen when you gain this heritage.
