# Mountaineer Samsaran

### [[samsaran]]






Your past incarnations dwelled in the caves on the snowcapped mountains of Tian Xia, so your body has become adept at surviving frigid storms. You gain cold resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1). You treat environmental cold effects as if they were one step less extreme (incredible cold becomes extreme, extreme cold becomes severe, and so on).
