# Grave Orc

### 






You were exposed to powerful necromantic energies that should have killed youâ€”but you survived. Your skin is cold, clammy, and gray. You gain resistance to void damage equal to half your level (minimum 1). You also gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against effects with the death or void trait.
