# Even-Tempered Tanuki

### [[tanuki]]






You're possessed of a serenity uncommon to other tanuki, who always seem to be flying off the handle. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against emotion effects. If you roll a success at a saving throw against an emotion effect, you get a critical success instead, but when you roll a failure at a saving throw against an emotion effect, you get a critical failure instead.
