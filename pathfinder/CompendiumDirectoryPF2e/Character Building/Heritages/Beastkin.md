# Beastkin

### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[beastkin]]






The blood of a beast flows through your veins, granting you the ferocity and might of animals. Only creatures with the humanoid trait can take the beastkin versatile heritage. Choose a type of animal such as bat, eagle, shark, spider, tyrannosaurus, wasp, or wolf. This is the type of animal tied to your heritage and is known as your inherent animal. A beastkin's hybrid form is their natural shape. You gain the beast and beastkin traits, in addition to the traits from your ancestry.

You gain the [[Actions/Change Shape|Change Shape]] ability. You can choose from beastkin feats and feats from your ancestry whenever you gain an ancestry feat.
