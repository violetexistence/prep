# Jinxed Tengu

### 






Your lineage has been exposed to curse after curse, and now they slide off your feathers like rain. If you succeed at a saving throw against a curse or misfortune effect, you get a critical success instead. When you would gain the [[Conditions/Doomed|Doomed]] condition, attempt a `DC 17 Flat check`. On a success, reduce the value of the doomed condition you would gain by 1.
