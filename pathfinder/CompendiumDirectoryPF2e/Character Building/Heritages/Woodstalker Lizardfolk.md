# Woodstalker Lizardfolk

### 






You move easily through thick forest and jungle, using every branch or bush. You can always use the [[Actions/Take Cover|Take Cover]] action when in forest or jungle terrain to gain cover, even if you're not next to an obstacle you would normally be able to Take Cover behind. You gain the [[Feats/Terrain Stalker|Terrain Stalker]] feat, even if you're not trained in Stealth, and you must choose underbrush as your chosen terrain.
