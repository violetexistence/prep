# Elemental Heart Dwarf

### 






Whether through a connection to [[Deities/Torag|Torag's]] forge, the azers of the Plane of Fire, or another source, you can exude a burst of energy. Mbe'ke and Taralu dwarves of the Mwangi Expanse believe this heritage is a gift from dragons or elemental spirits. Choose one of the following damage types: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. Once chosen, this can't be changed. You gain the [[Actions/Energy Emanation|Energy Emanation]] activity.
