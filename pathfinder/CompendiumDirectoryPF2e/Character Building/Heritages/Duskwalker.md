# Duskwalker

### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[duskwalker]]






Thanks to an ancient bargain, your soul has been reborn as a duskwalker, a planar scion with a connection to psychopomps and the Boneyard. You gain the duskwalker trait. You also gain low-light vision, or you gain darkvision if your ancestry already has low-light vision. Neither your body nor your spirit can ever become undead. You can select from duskwalker feats and feats from your ancestry whenever you gain an ancestry feat.
