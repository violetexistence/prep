# Warrior Automaton

### 






Sporting a bulkier, powerful design, your body has been designed for combat. You have a bulky, humanoid shape. The damage die for your fist increases to 1d6 instead of 1d4. You don't take a penalty when making a lethal attack with your fist or any other unarmed attack.
