# Fodder Skeleton

### 






Humans, and those who are physically closest to them, are the favored material of necromancers. They are readily available, and their physiology has been studied the most extensively, so these skeletons can be easily mass-produced. Despite their name, fodder skeletons make rather mobile foot soldiers due to how efficiently they transfer necromantic energy within their bodies. You have a base Speed of 30 feet, instead of 25 feet.
