# Kanchil

### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[sprite]]






You have the head of a mouse deer and hooves instead of feet, with a reputation for being clever and persuasiveâ€”able to get yourself out of sticky situations with wordplay and a bit of luck. You become trained in Deception (or another skill if you were already trained in Deception). You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Deception checks to Lie when specifically attempting to avoid danger or punishment (such as trying to convince a dragon not to eat you), to Deception DCs against [[Actions/Sense Motive|Sense Motive]] checks to uncover such lies, and to initiative rolls when you roll Deception for initiative.
