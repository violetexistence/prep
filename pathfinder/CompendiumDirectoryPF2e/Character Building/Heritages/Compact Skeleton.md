# Compact Skeleton

### 






For tasks that require a lighter touch, gnome, goblin, and halfling remains are more suitable than a larger creature's. These smaller, nimbler skeletons fit well in a traveling chest, can be forced through tight spaces, and more easily avoid detection. Your size is Small instead of Medium. You gain the [[Feats/Quick Squeeze|Quick Squeeze]] feat, even if you aren't trained in Acrobatics. Tight spaces not tight enough to require the Squeeze activity aren't difficult terrain for you.
