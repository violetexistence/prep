# Liminal Fetchling

### 






You come from a line of fetchlings with a closer connection to the Ethereal and Shadow Planes, and you share those realms' affinity with the in-between and unseen. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to locate [[Conditions/Undetected|Undetected]] creatures within 60 feet when using the Seek action. Your flat check to target [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] creatures is `DC 3 Flat check` instead of DC 5, and your flat check to target undetected creatures is `DC 9 Flat check` instead of DC 11.
