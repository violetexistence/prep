# Spellhorn Kobold

### 






Since hatching in the vicinity of a powerful source of magic, a trace of it flows through your veins. Choose one common cantrip from the arcane spell list. You can Cast this Spell as an arcane innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell rank equal to half your level rounded up. You are trained in the spell attack modifier and spell DC statistics, and your key spellcasting ability is Charisma.
