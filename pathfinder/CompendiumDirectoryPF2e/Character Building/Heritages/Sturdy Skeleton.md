# Sturdy Skeleton

### 






Certain hazardous conditions are not suitable for the average skeleton, so a necromancer might choose to reanimate the bones of a dwarf, orc, or other creature with a reputation for sturdiness. You have 10 Hit Points instead of 6 and gain the [[Feats/Diehard|Diehard]] feat.
