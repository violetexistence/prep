# Winter Kholo

### 






You're a hardy kholo covered in thick, tufted fur that makes you able to survive in the harsh winters of the colder territories. You gain cold resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1). You treat environmental cold effects as if they were one step less extreme (incredible cold becomes extreme, extreme cold becomes severe, and so on).
