# Liminal Catfolk

### 






You've inherited a closeness to the far corners of the world, where the boundaries between dimensions grow thin. You can cast the [[Spells/Detect Magic|Detect Magic]] cantrip as an occult innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to half your level rounded up. You also gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Occultism checks to [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] about creatures that originated on planes other than the Universe.
