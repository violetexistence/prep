# Tailed Goblin

### 






You have a powerful tail, likely because you descend from a community of monkey goblins. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks to [[Actions/Climb|Climb]], you gain [[Feats/Combat Climber|Combat Climber]] as a bonus feat, and you reduce the number of free hands required to climb or [[Actions/Trip|Trip]] by one.
