# Born of Item

### [[yaoguai]]






You were an object until the moon breathed life into you. Choose one Lore skill related to what kind of tool you were; for instance, Cooking Lore for a cleaver or Farming Lore for a rake. You become trained in this skill.

*   **Humanoid Form** You retain memories of the tasks you performed as an object. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the Lore skill you obtained through this heritage.
*   **Yaoguai Form** Your time as a mindless object makes it harder to affect you mentally. If you roll a success on a mental effect, you gain a critical success instead.
