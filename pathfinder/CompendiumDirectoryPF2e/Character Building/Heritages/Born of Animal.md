# Born of Animal

### [[yaoguai]]






You were a simple animal until the sun enlightened you.

*   **Humanoid Form** Animals can sense the power of your presence. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Intimidation checks against animals and beasts and don't take a penalty for attempting to Intimidate animals or beasts you don't share a language with.
*   **Yaoguai Form** You can dash like an animal. If you have both hands free, you can increase your Speed to 30 feet as you run on all fours.
