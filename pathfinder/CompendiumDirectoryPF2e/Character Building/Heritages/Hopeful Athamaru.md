# Hopeful Athamaru

### 






You have begun to prepare yourself to become an athamaru matriarch, and are likely stepping outside of your community to better prepare yourself as a leader. As part of the physical change, you are substantially taller than you once were. Instead of Medium, your size is Large. In addition, you instill your allies with a feeling of hopefulness. You have a 10-foot aura that grants any ally in it a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against fear; this is an emotion and mental effect.
