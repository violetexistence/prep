# Roaming Minotaur

### 






Your hooves are broad and powerful, perfect for clearing away rubble as you step. You become trained in Survival (or another skill if you were already trained in Survival) and gain the [[Feats/Terrain Expertise|Terrain Expertise]] skill feat. You ignore difficult terrain caused by natural uneven ground while in the terrain chosen for your Terrain Expertise feat.
