# Budding Speaker Centaur

### 






You were born with a spark of magic that could set you on the path to becoming a Greenspeaker or Faithspeaker. Select divine or primal. If you selected divine, you're a Faithspeaker. If you selected primal, you're a Greenspeaker. This choice can't be changed. You gain one cantrip from the chosen spell list. You can cast this spell as an innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell rank equal to half your level rounded up.
