# Runtboss Hobgoblin

### 






You come from a long line of hobgoblins who commanded goblins. You are smaller than other hobgoblins, but goblins still listen to any commands you bellow. You gain the [[Feats/Group Coercion|Group Coercion]] skill feat. If you roll a success on an Intimidation check to [[Actions/Coerce|Coerce]] a goblin, you get a critical success instead; if you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead.
