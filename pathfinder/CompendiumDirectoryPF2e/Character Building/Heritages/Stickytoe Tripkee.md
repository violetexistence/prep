# Stickytoe Tripkee

### 






Your hands and feet exude a film that helps them adhere to surfaces. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Fortitude and Reflex DC against attempts to [[Actions/Disarm|Disarm]], [[Actions/Shove|Shove]], [[Actions/Reposition|Reposition]], or [[Actions/Trip|Trip]] you. When ascending trees, vines, and other foliage, if you roll a success on the Athletics check to Climb, you get a critical success instead.
