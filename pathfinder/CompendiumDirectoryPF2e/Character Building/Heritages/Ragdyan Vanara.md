# Ragdyan Vanara

### 






Keepers of traditions and tellers of ancient tales, your family traces its lineage to those born directly from Ragdya's whims. When you speak, others are inclined to listen to you, perhaps due to the divine spark of your connection to Ragdya. You gain one cantrip from the divine spell list; this cantrip can't deal damage or otherwise cause direct harm. You can cast this spell as a divine innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell rank equal to half your level rounded up.
