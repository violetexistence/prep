# Celestial Envoy Kitsune

### 






Whether due to Daikitsu's grace or faithful forebears, you have a strong connection to the divine, affording you certain protections. You gain the [[Actions/Invoke Celestial Privilege|Invoke Celestial Privilege]] reaction. Your alternate form is a common Medium humanoid ancestry prevalent where you grew up (typically human), called a tailless form.
