# Dragonblood

### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[dragonblood]]






You're descended in some way from a dragon. Your physical features might show this outwardly, with a pair of draconic horns, patches of scaly skin, or even a tail, or you might develop an internal reserve of draconic power. You gain the dragonblood trait, in addition to the traits from your ancestry. Add Draconic to your ancestry's list of additional languages (allowing you to choose it as a language if your Intelligence modifier is positive). When you roll a success on a saving throw against a fear effect, you get a critical success instead. You can choose from dragonblood feats and feats from your ancestry whenever you gain an ancestry feat.
