# Running Animal

### 






You are an animal meant for running at great speeds across land. Typically, you run on all fours like a dog, cheetah, or an iguana, but you could also use two legs like a kangaroo, emu, or penguin.

You have a land Speed of 30 feet and one animal attack of your choice (typically claw, jaws, or tail).
