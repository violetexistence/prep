# Cliffscale Lizardfolk

### 






Your toes are adapted for gripping and climbing. You gain the [[Feats/Combat Climber|Combat Climber]] feat as a bonus feat, and as long as you aren't wearing footwear, you can use the sticky pads on your feet to climb, leaving your hands free. Additionally, if you roll a success on an Athletics check to climb, you get a critical success instead.
