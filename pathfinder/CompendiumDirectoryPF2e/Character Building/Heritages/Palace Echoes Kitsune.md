# Palace Echoes Kitsune

### [[kitsune]]






You descend from kitsune who possessed such compelling powers of persuasion that they could walk into a palace at sunrise and end up as the power behind the throne by nightfall. You gain the [[Actions/Nudging Whisper|Nudging Whisper]] action.

Your alternate form is a common Medium humanoid ancestry prevalent where you grew up (typically human) called a tailless form.
