# Quilled Athamaru

### 






Sharp quills on your head can pierce your foes deeply. Most athamarus use such quills for defense, but a well-timed headbash can be devastatingly effective. You gain a quills melee unarmed attack that deals 1d6 piercing damage. Your quills are in the brawling group and have the agile, finesse, and unarmed traits.
