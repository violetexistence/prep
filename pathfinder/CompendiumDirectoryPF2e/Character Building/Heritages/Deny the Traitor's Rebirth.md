# Deny the Traitor's Rebirth

### [[yaksha]]






You swore a vow to deliver others from rakshasas and asuras, whom yaksha legends have condemned as corrupted kin. To counter their shadowy schemes, your vow grants you darkvision and a +1 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to [[Actions/Seek|Seek]] or [[Actions/Sense Motive|Sense the Motives]] of rakshasas and asuras.

* * *

**Additional Edict** confront rakshasas and asuras you come across (as long as you have a reasonable chance of success); in the unlikely event you find a benevolent rakshasa or asura, you don't have to confront them
