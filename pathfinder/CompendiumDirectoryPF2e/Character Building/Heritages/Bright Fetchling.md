# Bright Fetchling

### 






Your body proves that shadow can't exist without light. Perhaps your eyes glow brighter or your veins occasionally pulse with light. You emit dim light within 5 feet of you. You can activate or suppress this ability as an action, which has the concentrate trait. Additionally, you can force fragments of your shadow to glow and cast [[Spells/Light|Light]] as an occult innate cantrip. Cantrips are heightened to a spell rank equal to half your level rounded up.
