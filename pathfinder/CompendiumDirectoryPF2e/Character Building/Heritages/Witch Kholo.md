# Witch Kholo

### 






You're a shaggy, dark-furred kholo capable of making some truly uncanny sounds. You can cast the [[Spells/Figment|Figment]] cantrip as an occult innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell rank equal to half your level rounded up. In addition, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to [[Actions/Create a Diversion|Create a Diversion]] and Impersonate when using only your voice.
