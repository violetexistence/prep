# Pelagic Merfolk

### 






You're a merfolk of the open seas. Your tail is patterned after the silvery tuna and herring that school by the million in your hunting grounds. Water obeys your will, and with a quick word, you can draw a sheathe of it around you. You gain the [[Actions/Shielding Wave|Shielding Wave]] action.
