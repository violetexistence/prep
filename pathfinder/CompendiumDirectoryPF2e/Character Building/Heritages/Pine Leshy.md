# Pine Leshy

### 






You excrete a thick, sticky sap from your bark-like flesh, making it easier to climb and hold onto your gear. You gain the [[Feats/Combat Climber|Combat Climber]] feat as a bonus feat, and you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Reflex DC against attempts to [[Actions/Disarm|Disarm]] you.
