# Changeling

### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[changeling]]






Your mother was a hag. Your eyes' heterochromia is the most obvious signifier of this parentage, but you likely also have a slighter build, paler skin, and darker hair than most members of your other parent's ancestry. You gain the changeling trait. You also gain low-light vision, or you gain darkvision if your ancestry already has low-light vision. You can select from changeling feats and feats from your other parent's ancestry whenever you gain an ancestry feat.
