# Ant Kholo

### 






You're a sharp-featured, big-eared kholo about 3 feet tall. Many are skeptical that you are in fact a kholo. Your size is Small instead of Medium. You are trained in Deception (or another skill if you were already trained in Deception). You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Deception checks to Lie when specifically claiming innocence, to Deception DCs against [[Actions/Sense Motive|Sense Motive]] checks to uncover such lies, and to initiative checks when you roll Deception for initiative.
