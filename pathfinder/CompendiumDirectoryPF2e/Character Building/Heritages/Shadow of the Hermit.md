# Shadow of the Hermit

### [[wayang]]






Your shadow seems somehow full of secrets and mysteriesâ€”secrets that it shares with you. Choose one cantrip from the occult spell list. You can cast this spell as an occult innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell rank equal to half your level rounded up.
