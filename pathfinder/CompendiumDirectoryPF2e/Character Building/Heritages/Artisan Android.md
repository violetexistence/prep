# Artisan Android

### 






Your body was originally designed to create works of art, complex tools, or maintain advanced machinery. You become trained in Crafting (or another skill if you're already trained in Crafting), and you gain the [[Feats/Specialty Crafting|Specialty Crafting]] skill feat in a specialty of your choice.
