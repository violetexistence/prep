# Nagaji

### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[humanoid]][[nagaji]]



**Size** med


With humanoid figures and serpentine heads, nagaji are heralds, companions, and servitors of powerful nagas. They hold a deep reverence for holy areas and spiritual truths, an aspect many others find as intimidating as a nagaji's appearance.
