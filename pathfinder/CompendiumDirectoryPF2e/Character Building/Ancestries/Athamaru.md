# Athamaru

### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[amphibious]][[athamaru]][[humanoid]]



**Size** med


Athamarus are fish-like humanoids who form tight-knit undersea communities. In small settlements, they engage in the subsistence farming of seaweed, train eels to serve as mounts, and create elaborate works of coral art. Their interactions with other aquatic ancestries are strained, as athamarus have suffered mistreatment at their hands. However, they remain curious about potential connections and what new opportunities may offer.
