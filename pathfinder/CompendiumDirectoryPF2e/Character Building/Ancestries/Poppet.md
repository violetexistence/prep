# Poppet

### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[construct]][[humanoid]]



**Size** sm


_Poppets are small, basic constructs that typically help their owners with simple tasks. Occasionally, poppets gain sapience, independence, and a spark of life. Elevated beyond mere helpers or playthings, these poppets are free to chart their own destinies._
