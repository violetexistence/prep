# Escape `pf2:1`

### [[attack]]

**Category** interaction; 




You attempt to escape from being [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]], [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]], or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]. Choose one creature, object, spell effect, hazard, or other impediment imposing any of those conditions on you. Attempt a check using your [[Actions/escape statistic=unarmed|escape statistic=unarmed]]{unarmed attack modifier} against the DC of the effect. This is typically the Athletics DC of a creature grabbing you, the Thievery DC of a creature who tied you up, the spell DC for a spell effect, or the listed Escape DC of an object, hazard, or other impediment. You can attempt an [[Actions/escape statistic=acrobatics|escape statistic=acrobatics]]{Acrobatics} or [[Actions/escape statistic=athletics|escape statistic=athletics]]{Athletics} check instead of using your attack modifier if you choose (but this action still has the attack trait).
