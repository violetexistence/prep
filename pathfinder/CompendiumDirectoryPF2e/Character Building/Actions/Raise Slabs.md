# Raise Slabs `pf2:2`

### [[divine]][[earth]]

**Category** offensive; 




**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** Thick slabs of stone rise around you before tilting over. You deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage to all adjacent creatures (`Reflex check` against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher). On a critical failure, the creature is also knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]. At 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, this damage increases by 1d6.
