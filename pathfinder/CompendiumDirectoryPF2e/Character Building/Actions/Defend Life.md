# Defend Life `pf2:r`

### [[concentrate]]

**Category** interaction; 




**Trigger** The target takes damage

**Requirements** You're within 1 mile of the target

* * *

**Effect** After calculating the amount of damage the target would take (applying weaknesses, resistances, and the like), you lose an equal number of Hit Points, and the target doesn't take any of the damage. You can't reduce the amount of Hit Points you lose in this way. The target still takes any effects that would come with the damage, however, such as the venom on a viper's fangs Strike.
