# Scout Location

### [[downtime]][[secret]]

**Category** interaction; 




You spend time observing the place or group you wish to infiltrate. Attempt a normal, hard, or very hard DC Perception, Society or Stealth check.

* * *

**Success** You make observations that provide 1 EP.

**Failure** You learn nothing particularly noteworthy.

**Critical Failure** You misjudge some aspect of what you observed, gaining 1 EP that results in a critical failure instead of a success when used, even if a PC uses the Edge Point after rolling a failure.
