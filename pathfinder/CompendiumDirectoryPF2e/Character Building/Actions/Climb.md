# Climb `pf2:1`

### [[move]]

**Category** interaction; 




**Requirements** You have both hands free

* * *

You attempt an [[Actions/climb|climb]]{Athletics} check to move a maximum distance of 5 feet up, down, or across an incline. You're [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] while climbing unless you have a climb Speed. The GM determines the DC based on the nature of the incline and environmental circumstances; you might get an automatic critical success on an incline that's trivial to climb. If your land Speed is 40 feet or higher, increase the maximum distance by 5 feet for every 20 feet of Speed above 20 feet.

* * *

**Critical Success** You move along the incline, increasing the maximum distance by 5 feet.

**Success** You move along the incline.

**Critical Failure** You fall. If you began the climb on stable ground, you fall and land [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]].

## Sample Climb Tasks

*   **Trained** rigging, rope, typical tree
*   **Expert** wall with small handholds and footholds
