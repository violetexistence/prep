# Dragon Breath `pf2:2`

### 

**Category** offensive; 




**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

**Effect** You breathe deeply and exhale a line or cone of powerful breath, much like the dragon with which you made the pact. If the dragon had a cone-shaped breath weapon, your breath weapon is a 30-foot cone. If they had a line-shaped breath weapon, your breath weapon is a 60-foot line. If they had a burst-shaped breath weapon, your breath weapon is a 10-foot burst within 60 feet. No matter the shape, it deals 1d6 damage per level, of the same damage type as the dragon's Breath Weapon, with a `Reflex check` save, using the higher of your class DC or spell DC. This action has the same traits as the breath weapon of the dragon you made the pact with.
