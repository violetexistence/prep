# Breath Weapon (Riding Drake) `pf2:2`

### 

**Category** offensive; 




The riding drake breathes a 30-foot cone of fire, dealing 1d6 fire damage for every 2 levels the drake has to all creatures in the area (`Reflex check` save). This uses a trained DC using the drake's Constitution modifier or an expert DC if the drake is specialized.
