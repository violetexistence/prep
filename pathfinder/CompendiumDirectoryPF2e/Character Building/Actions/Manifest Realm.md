**Category** offensive; 




**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

**Effect** You corrupt the surrounding area into a manifestation of your realm in a 20-foot-radius burst centered on you. Your manifested realm counts as difficult terrain for your enemies, and your enemies take a â€“1 penalty to Fortitude saving throws while in your manifested realm.

[[Feat_Feature Effects/Effect_ Manifest Realm|Effect: Manifest Realm]]

You can Sustain your manifested realm once per round on subsequent rounds, and if you do not, the radius of your manifested realm is reduced by 5 feet.

Your realm remains manifested for a maximum of 1 minute, and you can Dismiss your manifested realm. If your manifested realm's radius is ever reduced to 0 feet or if you move beyond 100 feet from the borders of your manifested realm, your manifested realm is automatically Dismissed.
