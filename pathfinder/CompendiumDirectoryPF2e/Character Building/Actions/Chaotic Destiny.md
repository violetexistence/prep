### [[fortune]]

**Category** offensive; 




**Trigger** You fail a saving throw during a combat

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** Chaos intervenes on your behalf at the last instant as you fail a saving throw. Draw a harrow card and reroll the saving throw you failed. You must take the result of the reroll, but if you drew a card from the suit of Crowns, improve the result by one degree of success.
