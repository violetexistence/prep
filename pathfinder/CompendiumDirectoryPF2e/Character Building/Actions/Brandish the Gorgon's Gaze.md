# Brandish the Gorgon's Gaze `pf2:1`

### [[earth]][[transcendence]][[visual]]

**Category** offensive; 




You Raise your _mirrored aegis_, though it seems to lose some of its usual luster in favor of the dull sheen of stone. If you Shield Block a melee attack with the mirrored aegis before the beginning of your next turn, the gorgon's eyes upon it flash at the triggering creature, who must attempt a `Fortitude check` save against your class DC. On a failure, they are [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] for 1 minute as their body partially petrifies. Regardless of the outcome, that creature is temporarily immune to this effect for 24 hours.
