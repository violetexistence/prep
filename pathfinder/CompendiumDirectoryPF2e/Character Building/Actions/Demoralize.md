# Demoralize `pf2:1`

### [[auditory]][[concentrate]][[emotion]][[fear]][[mental]]

**Category** offensive; 




With a sudden shout, a well-timed taunt, or a cutting put-down, you can shake an enemy's resolve. Choose a creature within 30 feet of you who you're aware of. Attempt an [[Actions/demoralize|demoralize]]{Intimidation} check against that target's Will DC. If the target doesn't understand the language you are speaking, or you're not speaking a language, you take a â€“4 circumstance penalty to the check. Regardless of your result, the target is temporarily immune to your attempts to Demoralize it for 10 minutes.

**Critical Success** The target becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]].

**Success** The target becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]].
