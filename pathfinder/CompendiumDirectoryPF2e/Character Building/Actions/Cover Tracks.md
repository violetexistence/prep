# Cover Tracks

### [[concentrate]][[exploration]][[move]]

**Category** defensive; 




You cover your tracks, moving up to half your travel Speed, using the [[PF2e Journals/GM Screen/Travel Speed|Travel Speed]] rules. You don't need to attempt a Survival check to cover your tracks, but anyone tracking you must succeed at a Survival check against your Survival DC if it is higher than the normal DC to [[Actions/Track|Track]].

In some cases, you might Cover Tracks in an encounter. In this case, Cover Tracks is a single action and doesn't have the exploration trait.
