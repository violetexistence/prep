# Force Open `pf2:1`

### [[attack]]

**Category** interaction; 




Using your body, a lever, or some other tool, you attempt to forcefully open a door, window, container or heavy gate. With a high enough result, you can even smash through walls. Without a crowbar, prying something open takes a –2 item penalty to the [[Actions/force-open|force-open]]{Athletics} check to Force Open.

* * *

**Critical Success** You open the door, window, container, or gate and can avoid damaging it in the process.

**Success** You break the door, window, container, or gate open, and it gains the broken condition. If it's especially sturdy, the GM might have it take damage but not be broken.

**Critical Failure** Your attempt jams the door, window, container, or gate shut, imposing a –2 circumstance penalty on future attempts to Force it Open.

## Sample Force Open Tasks
