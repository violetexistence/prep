# Telekinetic Assault `pf2:2`

### [[divine]]






Your ghost unleashes a flurry of emotions, causing small objects and debris to fly about in a 20-foot emanation, dealing 1d6 bludgeoning for every 2 levels the ghost has (`Reflex check` save). This uses a trained DC using the ghost's Charisma modifier or an expert DC if the ghost is specialized.
