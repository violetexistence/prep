# Slip and Sizzle `pf2:2`

### [[commander]][[tactic]]

**Category** offensive; 




Your team executes a brutal technique designed to knock down an opponent and blast them with magical devastation. Signal up to two squadmates within the aura of your commander's banner; one of these squadmates must be adjacent to an opponent and the other must be capable of casting a spell that deals damage. The first squadmate can attempt to [[Actions/Trip|Trip]] the adjacent opponent as a reaction. If this Trip is successful, the second squadmate can cast a ranged spell that deals damage and takes 2 or fewer actions to cast. This spell is cast as a reaction and must either target the tripped opponent or include the tripped opponent in the spell's area.

If the second squadmate cast a spell using slots or Focus Points as part of this tactic, they are [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] until the end of their next turn and do not gain a reaction when they regain actions at the start of their next turn.
