# Heavy is the Crown `pf2:2`

### [[concentrate]][[mental]][[spirit]][[transcendence]]

**Category** offensive; 




The weight of authority falls heavily upon you, as well as nearby creatures. All enemies in a 15-foot burst within 60 feet take spirit damage damage equal to your level with a `Will check` save against your class DC. Any enemy that fails its save must immediately kneel, dropping [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] as a free action.
