# End It! `pf2:2`

### [[brandish]][[commander]][[incapacitation]][[tactic]]

**Category** offensive; 




**Requirements** You and your allies currently outnumber enemies on the battlefield, and you or a squadmate have reduced an enemy to 0 Hit Points since the start of your last turn.

* * *

At your proclamation that victory is already at hand, your allies march forward with an authoritative stomp, scattering your enemies in terror. Signal all squadmates within the aura of your banner; you and each ally can Step as a free action directly toward a hostile creature. Any hostile creatures within 10 feet of a squadmate after this movement must attempt a `Will check` save against your class DC; on a failure they become [[Conditions/Fleeing|Fleeing]] for 1 round, and on a critical failure they become fleeing for 1 round and [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]]. This is an emotion, fear, and mental effect.
