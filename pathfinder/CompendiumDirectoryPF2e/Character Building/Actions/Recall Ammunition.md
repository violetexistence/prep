### [[magical]][[spellshot]][[teleportation]]

**Category** interaction; 




**Trigger** You miss with a firearm or crossbow Strike.

You create a bond to your ammunition, calling your missed shot back. The ammunition you just fired is reloaded back into your weapon. If the ammunition was a piece of magical or alchemical ammunition that normally requires one or more actions to activate, you must re-activate it before firing again.
