# Sever Four Dragonfly Wings `pf2:3`

### [[transcendence]]






Make a Strike that deals slashing damage with your weapon ikon. If that Strike is successful, you can immediately make an additional Strike against a different target within your reach. You can continue making Strikes in this manner, each against a different target, until you have made a total of four Strikes or you miss with a Strike, whichever comes first. Each attack counts toward your multiple attack penalty, but you do not increase your penalty until you have made all your attacks.
