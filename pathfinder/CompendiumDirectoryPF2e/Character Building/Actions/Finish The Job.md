# Finish The Job `pf2:1`

### [[gunslinger]]

**Category** offensive; 




**Requirements** On your last action, you failed (but didn't critically fail) a Strike with a firearm or crossbow you're holding in one hand, and your other hand is either wielding a melee weapon or empty.

* * *

Your last attack failed, but it set you up for another. Make a Strike with your other hand, using a one-handed melee weapon or unarmed attack. This Strike uses the same multiple attack penalty as the Strike that failed on the last action. Afterward, increase your multiple attack penalty normally.
