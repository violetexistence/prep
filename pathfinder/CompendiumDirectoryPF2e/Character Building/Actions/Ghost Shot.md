# Ghost Shot `pf2:1`

### [[flourish]][[gunslinger]]

**Category** offensive; 




Make a firearm or crossbow Strike. If you're [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] from or [[Conditions/Undetected|Undetected]] by the target, the Strike adds the additional precision damage from [[Actions/One Shot, One Kill|One Shot, One Kill]]; if you would already receive that additional damage on the Strike, the effects aren't cumulative. If you were undetected or [[Conditions/Unnoticed|Unnoticed]] by any creatures, you're now hidden from them instead, or undetected if the shot was made with a silencer.
