# Shields Up! `pf2:1`

### [[commander]][[tactic]]

**Category** offensive; 




You signal your allies to ready their defenses. Signal all squadmates within the aura of your commander's banner; each can immediately Raise a Shield as a reaction. Squadmates who are wielding a parry weapon can instead position that weapon defensively as a reaction.

* * *

**Special** If one of your squadmates knows or has prepared the [[Spells/Shield|Shield]] cantrip, they can cast it as a reaction instead of taking the actions normally granted by this tactic.
