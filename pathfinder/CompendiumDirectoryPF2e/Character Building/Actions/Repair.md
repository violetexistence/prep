**Success** You restore 5 Hit Points to the item, plus an additional 5 per proficiency rank you have in Crafting (for a total of 10 HP if you are trained, 15 HP if you're an expert, 20 HP if you're a master, or 25 HP if you're legendary).

**Critical Failure** You deal 2d6 damage to the item. Apply the item's Hardness to this damage.
