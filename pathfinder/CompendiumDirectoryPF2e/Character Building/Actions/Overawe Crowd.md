# Overawe Crowd `pf2:2`

### [[concentrate]]

**Category** offensive; 




**Requirements** You are sharing the same space as a swarm or are adjacent to a troop

* * *

**Effect** Spend 1 Mythic Point and attempt an Intimidation check at mythic proficiency against the Will DC of the required swarm or troop. On a failure, the target Strides in a direction of your choosing and you move along with it. On a success, the target Strides twice in a direction of your choosing and you can decide whether or not to move along with it. No matter the result, the target is [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]] and temporarily immune to your Overawe Crowd for 24 hours.
