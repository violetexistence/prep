# Step `pf2:1`

### [[move]]

**Category** interaction; 




**Requirements** Your Speed is at least 10 feet.

* * *

You carefully move 5 feet. Unlike most types of movement, Stepping doesn't trigger reactions, such as [[Actions/Reactive Strike|Reactive Strike]], that can be triggered by move actions or upon leaving or entering a square.

You can't Step into difficult terrain, and you can't Step using a Speed other than your land Speed.
