# Anchor `pf2:1`

### [[leshy]]

**Category** offensive; 




**Requirements** You're on a solid surface

* * *

**Effect** You send your roots into or across the ground, making it harder for you to stumble. Until you move, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Fortitude or Reflex DC against attempts to [[Actions/Reposition|Reposition]], [[Actions/Shove|Shove]], or [[Actions/Trip|Trip]] you (or a +4 circumstance bonus if you're a root leshy). This bonus also applies to saving throws against spells or effects that attempt to move you or knock you [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]. If an effect forces you to move, you move only half the normal distance, as some of the effort goes to tearing loose the roots.
