# Defensive Retreat `pf2:2`

### [[brandish]][[commander]][[tactic]]

**Category** offensive; 




You call for a careful retreat. Signal all squadmates within the aura of your banner; each can immediately Step up to three times as a free action. Each Step must take them farther away from at least one hostile creature they are observing and can only take them closer to a hostile creature if doing so is the only way for them to move toward safety (such as if they're surrounded).
