# Pointed Question `pf2:1`

### [[auditory]][[concentrate]][[investigator]][[linguistic]][[mental]]

**Category** interaction; 




You ask a question that charms or needles someone in just the right way. Ask a question of a non-allied creature that you can see. Attempt a `Diplomacy check` check against the creature's Will DC. The creature is then temporarily immune for 1 hour.

**Critical Success** The target must directly answer your question. It doesn't have to answer truthfully, but you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to your Perception DC if the creature attempts to [[Actions/Lie|Lie]] to you.

Whether it answers truthfully or not, you glean something from its body language, and it is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] to the Strike you make using [[Actions/Devise a Stratagem|Devise a Stratagem]] against it before the end of your turn.

**Success** As critical success, but the circumstance bonus to your Perception DC is +2.

**Failure** The target can refuse to answer you as normal.

**Critical Failure** The target can refuse to answer you as normal, and its attitude toward you decreases by one step due to your aggravating attention.
