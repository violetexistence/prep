# Wicked Thorns `pf2:r`

### 

**Category** offensive; 




**Trigger** You're hit with an unarmed Strike or a Strike with a non-reach melee weapon.

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

Several of your thorns break off and hook into your attacker's body. You deal 1d8 piercing damage to the triggering creature. It attempts a `Reflex check` save against the higher of your class DC or spell DC. On a critical failure, the creature also takes 1d4+ceil(1/2)-1 bleed damage as your thorns embed in its flesh.

At 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, this damage increases by 1d8, and the persistent bleed damage increases by 1.
