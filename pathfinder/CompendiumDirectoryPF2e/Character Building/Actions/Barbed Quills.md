# Barbed Quills `pf2:r`

### [[shisk]]

**Category** offensive; 




**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** You are hit with an unarmed strike or a strike with a non-reach melee weapon.

* * *

You break off quills in your attacker's flesh. You deal 1d8 piercing damage to the triggering creature (`Reflex check` save using your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.) On a critical failure, the creature also takes 1d4+ceil(1/2)-1 bleed as your quills hook into its flesh. At 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, this damage increases by 1d8 and the persistent piercing damage increases by 1.
