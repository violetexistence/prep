# Mirrored Wall `pf2:2`

### [[commander]][[tactic]][[visual]]

**Category** offensive; 




**Frequency** once per 10 minutes

**Requirements** At least one of your squadmates is in bright light or has a focused light source available, such as a bull's-eye lantern.

Your squadmates have polished their shields to a reflective sheen and now position them to reflect a blinding light into your enemy's eyes. All of your squadmates can Raise a Shield or cast [[Spells/Shield|Shield]] as a reaction.

Then, signal a squadmate within the aura of your commander's banner who currently has a shield raised (including spellcasting allies with an active casting of the _shield_ cantrip), and choose an enemy within 60 feet. The formation bounces light off the raised shield and into the enemy's eyes; the target must succeed at a `Fortitude check` saving throw against your class DC or become [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] for 1 round (on a critical failure, the creature remains [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] for 3 rounds after the blindness ends).

You can signal additional allies with raised shields to participate in this tactic; the target takes a circumstance penalty on this save equal to the number of additional participating squadmates (to a maximum â€“4 circumstance penalty to the target's save).
