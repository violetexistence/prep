# Valkyrie's Charge `pf2:3`

### [[brandish]][[commander]][[tactic]]

**Category** offensive; 




**Frequency** once per day

* * *

You and your allies defy death and defeat to make a glorious final charge. You restore 80 healing Hit Points to each squadmate within the aura of your commander's banner; this effect has the healing trait. If an affected ally was [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]] due to their Hit Points being reduced to 0, they can immediately Stand and pick up any dropped weapons as a free action. Then, each affected squadmate can, as a free action, Stride up to twice their Speed directly toward an enemy they are observing; if they end this movement with an enemy within their reach, they can attempt to Strike that enemy as a reaction.

Squadmates can use Valkyrie's Charge while Burrowing, Climbing, Flying, or Swimming instead of Striding if they have the corresponding movement type.
