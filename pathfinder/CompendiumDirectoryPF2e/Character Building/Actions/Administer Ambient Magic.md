# Administer Ambient Magic `pf2:1`

### [[healing]]

**Category** defensive; 




**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

**Effect** Your ostilli pulses a calm lavender color as it converts stored magic into a curative balm. You regain 0d4 healing Hit Points, and you can immediately attempt a flat check to recover from persistent bleed damage with the DC reduced to 10. This healing increases by 2d4 at 8th level and every 4 levels thereafter.
