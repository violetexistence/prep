# Burn out of Time `pf2:2`

### [[spirit]][[transcendence]][[void]]

**Category** offensive; 




An impossible amount of energy blazes in a sphere above you before compressing itself into your weapon. Strike one creature. The Strike deals an additional 3d8 spirit damage and 3d8 void damage. If the creature is reduced to 0 Hit Points, it's immediately killed and reduced to ash, not in the present, but in the recent past, erasing the consequences of their recent actions.

If a creature died within the last round as a result of the incinerated target's actions, that creature is returned to life with 5d8 healing Hit Points at the location that it died as its death is retroactively undone.
