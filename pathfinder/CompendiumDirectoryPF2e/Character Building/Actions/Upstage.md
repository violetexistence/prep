# Upstage `pf2:r`

### 

**Category** defensive; 




**Trigger** An enemy attempts a skill check and doesn't get a critical success

* * *

After your foe has tried their best, you show everyone how it's really done. Attempt a check using the same skill that triggered this reaction.

* * *

**Critical Success** You gain a +1 status bonus to attack rolls, Perception checks, saving throws, and skill checks until the end of your next turn.

**Success** As critical success, except you gain the benefits only if the triggering creature failed their skill check.
