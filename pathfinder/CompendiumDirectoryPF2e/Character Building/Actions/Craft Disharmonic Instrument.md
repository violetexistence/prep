# Craft Disharmonic Instrument

### [[downtime]][[manipulate]]

**Category** interaction; 




**Requirements** Legendary in Crafting

* * *

You use legendary Vudran techniques to craft a disharmonic instrument that incorporates pieces of Kothogaz's heart. This is likely a tanpura, but legends mention other instruments and even voice enhancers. A disharmonic instrument is a virtuoso musical instrument.

This activity requires seven disharmonic heartslivers, the formula for a disharmonic instrument, 55,000 gp worth of rare materials, and 7 days of work. At the end of the 7 days, attempt a `DC 40 Crafting check` check to Craft.

* * *

**Critical Success** You masterfully complete the disharmonic instrument. Holding the instrument grants immunity to Kothogaz's tympanic heartbeat and many-eyed blight.

**Success** You complete the disharmonic instrument.

**Failure** You don't complete the disharmonic instrument, and you contract many-eyed blight from the heartslivers.

**Critical Failure** As failure, and whenever you're on the same plane as Kothogaz, it can immediately teleport to you with its Disharmonic Door ability.
