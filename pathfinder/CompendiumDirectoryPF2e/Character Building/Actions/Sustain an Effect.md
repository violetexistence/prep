# Sustain an Effect

### [[concentrate]][[exploration]]

**Category** interaction; 




You Sustain one effect with a sustained duration while moving at half speed. Most such effects can be sustained for 10 minutes, though some specify they can be sustained for a different duration. Sustaining an effect that requires making complex decisions, such as [[Spells/Spiritual Armament|Spiritual Armament]], can make you [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]], as determined by the GM.
