You and your squad surge forward with a mighty roar. Signal all squadmates within the aura of your commander's banner. As a reaction, these squadmates can Stride up to twice their Speed directly toward any enemy they are observing.

Any creature within 10 feet of a squadmate once all movement from this tactic has been completed must attempt a `Will check` save against your class DC with the following results. This is an emotion, fear, incapacitation, and mental effect.
