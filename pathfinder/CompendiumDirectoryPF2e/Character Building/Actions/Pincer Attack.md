# Pincer Attack `pf2:1`

### [[commander]][[tactic]]

**Category** offensive; 




You call for an aggressive formation designed for exploiting enemies' vulnerabilities. Signal all squadmates; each can Step as a reaction. If any of your allies ends this movement adjacent to an opponent, that opponent is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] to melee attacks from you and all other squadmates who responded to Pincer Attack until the start of your next turn.
