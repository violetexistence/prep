# Stitching Strike `pf2:2`

### 

**Category** offensive; 




**Frequency** once per 10 minutes

* * *

**Effect** Your familiar unravels into magical fibers that encompass an enemy within 30 feet and deal 6d6 slashing damage, with a `Reflex check` save against your spell DC. On a failure, the target is also [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] for 1 round or until it [[Actions/Escape|Escapes]] against your spell DC. Your familiar then re-forms in its original square. At 9th level, and every 2 levels thereafter, the attack deals an additional 2d6 damage.
