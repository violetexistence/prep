# One Moment till Glory `pf2:1`

### [[concentrate]][[emotion]][[mental]][[transcendence]]

**Category** offensive; 




You rally your allies, carrying them from the brink of disaster to the verge of victory. Each ally in your aura can immediately attempt a new saving throw with a +2 status bonus against one ongoing negative effect or condition currently affecting it that required a save. Use the result of the new save to determine the outcome of the effect, unless the new save would have a worse result than the original save, in which case nothing happens. Each ally can gain this benefit against a given effect only once.
