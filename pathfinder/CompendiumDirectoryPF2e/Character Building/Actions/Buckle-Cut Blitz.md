# Buckle-Cut Blitz `pf2:2`

### [[brandish]][[commander]][[tactic]]

**Category** offensive; 




Your squad dashes past enemies, slicing their boot laces and breaking their belt buckles. Signal up to two squadmates within the aura of your commander's banner; these squadmates can Stride up to their Speed as a reaction. Each enemy they are adjacent to at any point during this movement must attempt a `Reflex check` save against your class DC or become [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] for 1 round ([[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 2]] on a critical failure).
