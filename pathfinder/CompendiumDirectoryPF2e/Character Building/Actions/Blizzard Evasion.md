# Blizzard Evasion `pf2:r`

### 

**Category** defensive; 




**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** You take 40 or more physical damage from a single attack

* * *

**Effect** You discorporate into a whirling blizzard for up to 3 rounds. During this time, you gain resistance 10 to physical damage and weakness 10 to force damage. You gain a fly speed of 40 feet, but the only action you can take is to [[Actions/Fly|Fly]]. The first time each round you enter another creature's space while discorporated, or the first time a creature enters your space, that creature takes 4d8 cold damage and must succeed at a `Fortitude check` saving throw against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher, or else be [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]]. At the start of your turn, you can end this effect as a free action.
