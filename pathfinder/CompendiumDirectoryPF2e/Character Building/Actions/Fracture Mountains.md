# Fracture Mountains `pf2:2`

### [[spirit]][[transcendence]]






Your spirit is so dense it takes on tangible force. Make a melee Strike with the [[Class Features/Titan's Breaker|Titan's Breaker]]. This counts as two attacks when calculating your multiple attack penalty. If this Strike hits, your additional spirit damage from the ikon's immanence increases to 4 plus an extra die of weapon damage.

If you're at least 10th level, it's increased to 6 spirit damage and two extra dice, and if you're at least 18th level, it's increased to 8 spirit damage and three extra dice.
