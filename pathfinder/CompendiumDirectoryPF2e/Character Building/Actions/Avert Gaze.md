# Avert Gaze `pf2:1`

### 






You avert your gaze from danger, such as a medusa's gaze. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saves against visual abilities that require you to look at a creature or object, such as a medusa's petrifying gaze. Your gaze remains averted until the start of your next turn.
