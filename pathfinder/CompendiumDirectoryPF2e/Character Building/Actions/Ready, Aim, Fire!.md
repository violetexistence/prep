# Ready, Aim, Fire! `pf2:2`

### [[brandish]][[commander]][[tactic]]

**Category** offensive; 




**Frequency** once per 10 minutes

* * *

You signal a volley of ranged attacks from your allies. Choose an enemy and signal up to three squadmates within the aura of your commander's banner; your squadmates can Interact to reload as a free action and attempt a ranged Strike against the enemy as a reaction

* * *

**Special** If one of your squadmates knows or has prepared a cantrip with a range of 30 feet or more that deals damage and requires 2 or fewer actions to cast, they can cast it targeting the enemy instead of taking the other actions normally granted by this tactic.
