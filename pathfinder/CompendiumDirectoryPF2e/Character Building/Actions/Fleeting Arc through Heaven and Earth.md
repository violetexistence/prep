# Fleeting Arc through Heaven and Earth `pf2:3`

### [[light]][[spirit]][[teleportation]][[transcendence]]

**Category** offensive; 




You swing your weapon in a wide arc, releasing a blazing rainbow that deals 9d6 spirit damage and 9d6 untyped damage of the same type as your weapon to all enemies in a 60-foot cone, with a `Fortitude check` save against your class DC. As the rainbow ripples out, you use it as a bridge to teleport to any location within the effect's area.
