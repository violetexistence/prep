# Dispelling Bullet `pf2:2`

### [[magical]][[spellshot]]

**Category** offensive; 




You imprint a bullet with a field of disruptive energy built upon your magical signature, disrupting the magic of whatever it hits. Make a firearm or crossbow Strike against a foe you can see. If you hit, you attempt to counteract a spell effect active on the target (your choice, or the highest-level effect if you don't choose). Your counteract rank is equal to half your level (rounded up), and your counteract check modifier is equal to your class DC â€“ 10.
