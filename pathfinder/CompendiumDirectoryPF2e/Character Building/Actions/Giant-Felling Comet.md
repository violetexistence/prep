# Giant-Felling Comet `pf2:2`

### [[spirit]][[transcendence]]






You shoot the [[Class Features/Starshot|Starshot]], causing a detonation in a 5-foot burst within 60 feet. Each creature in the area must succeed at a `Reflex check` save against your class DC or take spirit damage equal to your normal Strike damage with the starshot. Creatures larger than you take a â€“2 circumstance penalty to their saving throws. This shot requires any ammunition that would normally be required for the weapon.
