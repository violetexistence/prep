# Spin Tale `pf2:1`

### [[auditory]][[linguistic]]

**Category** interaction; 




**Frequency** once every 10 minutes

* * *

**Effect** You tell a story, designating one of your allies (but not yourself) as the hero of the story, and one enemy as the villain; both must be within 60 feet. The hero gains a +1 status bonus to attack rolls and saving throws against the villain until the start of your next turn. If you Spin a Tale on your next turn, the story continues for another round, for a maximum of 10 rounds. While the tale continues, minor, crude illusions spring into being in your space; these are arcane illusion effects that have no mechanical impact other than illustrating your tale.
