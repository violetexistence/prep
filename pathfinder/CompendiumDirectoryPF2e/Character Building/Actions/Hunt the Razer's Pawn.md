# Hunt the Razer's Pawn `pf2:1`

### 

**Category** offensive; 




Designate a single creature that you can see or hear, or whom you've spent a significant amount of time studying and reading about from afar (subject to the GM's approval), and who you know to be an agent of Treerazer. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to [[Actions/Seek|Seek]] or [[Actions/Sense Motive|Sense the Motive]] of this creature. This creature takes a –1 circumstance penalty to saving throws against spells or effects you create; this penalty increases to –2 against effects that have the holy trait.

You can have only one creature designated by Hunt the Razer's Pawn at a time. If you use this ability against a creature when you already have one designated, the prior creature loses the designation and the new creature gains the designation. This lasts until your next daily preparations.
