# Patron's Claim `pf2:2`

### 

**Category** offensive; 




**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

**Effect** Your familiar's mouth opens impossibly wide before your patron's grasping limb stretches forth from it at a creature within 30 feet, dealing 10d10 spirit damage with a `Fortitude check` save against your spell DC. If the creature fails its save and takes damage, it is also [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 2]] (or [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 4]] on a critical failure) and you regain 1 Focus Point, up to your usual maximum, as your patron grants you additional magic in exchange for your gift of your opponent's spirit.
