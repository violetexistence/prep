# Skirt the Underworld `pf2:2`

### [[concentrate]][[illusion]][[incapacitation]][[transcendence]]






You skirt into the world of the dead, becoming [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]] for 1 round, then Fly up to your Speed. Each enemy adjacent to you at any point during this movement must succeed at a `Fortitude check` save against your class DC or become [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] for 1 minute (or permanently on a critical failure).

For each creature blinded by this effect, the duration of the granted invisibility extends by 1 round. Undead and other creatures with strong ties to the world of the dead, such as psychopomps, are immune to this effect.
