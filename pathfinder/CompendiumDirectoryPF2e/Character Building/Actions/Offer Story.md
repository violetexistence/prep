# Offer Story `pf2:1`

### [[auditory]][[concentrate]][[divine]][[linguistic]][[mental]]

**Category** offensive; 




You share a story of your travels with a creature within 30 feet. You gain the blessing of Isthralei as a +1 status bonus to AC and Will saves until the end of your next turn. On their next turn, the creature you shared a story with can take a single action, which has the auditory, concentrate, linguistic, and mental traits, to respond with their own story to gain the same benefits until the end of the following turn.
