# Disable a Device `pf2:2`

### [[manipulate]]

**Category** interaction; 




This action allows you to disarm a trap or another complex device. Often, a device requires numerous successes before becoming disabled, depending on its construction and complexity. A [[Equipment/Thieves' Toolkit|Thieves' Toolkit]] is helpful and sometimes even required to Disable a Device, as determined by the GM, and sometimes a device requires a higher proficiency rank in Thievery to disable it.

Your [[Actions/disable-device|disable-device]]{Thievery} check result determines your progress.

* * *

**Critical Success** You disable the device, or you achieve two successes toward disabling a device requiring more than one success. You leave no trace of your tampering, and you can rearm the device later, if that type of device can be rearmed.

**Success** You disable the device, or you achieve one success toward disabling a device that requires more than one success.

**Critical Failure** You trigger the device.
