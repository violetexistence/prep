# Coiling Serpents `pf2:2`

### 






Make a ranged Strike with your ikon. If the Strike hits, the target must succeed at a `Reflex check` save against your class DC or the arrow transforms into a multitude of ethereal snakes that coil around the target, [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilizing]] it until it succeeds at an [[Actions/Escape|Escape]] attempt against your class DC.
