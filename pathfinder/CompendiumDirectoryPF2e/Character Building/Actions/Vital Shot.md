# Vital Shot `pf2:2`

### [[gunslinger]]

**Category** offensive; 




Your careful shot against an unsuspecting opponent pierces a vital artery or organ. Make a ranged Strike. If the target is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]], the Strike deals an extra die of weapon damage, and the foe takes persistent bleed damage equal to the amount of precision damage from your [[Actions/One Shot, One Kill|One Shot, One Kill]].
