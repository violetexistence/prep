# Rampaging Ferocity `pf2:0`

### 

**Category** offensive; 




**Trigger** You use [[Feats/Orc Ferocity|Orc Ferocity]]

* * *

You lash out viciously even as you fend off death. Make a single melee Strike. If this Strike brings a foe to 0 Hit Points, this activation of Orc Ferocity doesn't count against its frequency.
