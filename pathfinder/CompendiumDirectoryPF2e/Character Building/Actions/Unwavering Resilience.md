# Unwavering Resilience `pf2:r`

### 

**Category** offensive; 




**Trigger** You attempt a saving throw against a poison, disease, or mental effect, but you haven't rolled yet.

* * *

You tap into the power of the Plane of Wood, gaining strength and mental fortitude. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus on the triggering save. If you critically succeed at this saving throw, you become bolstered by your success; blossoms and new growth temporarily sprout all over your body, and you gain a number of temporary Hit Point equal to your level. These temporary Hit Points last for one minute. When there temporary Hit Points are lost, the verdant growth subsides.
