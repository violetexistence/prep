# Executioner's Volley `pf2:2`

### [[commander]][[tactic]]

**Category** offensive; 




**Frequency** once per day

* * *

You command your squadmates to act as a lethal firing squad. You and each squadmate within the aura of your commander's banner can attempt a ranged Strike as a reaction against a single target you choose; combine the damage from all attacks for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses. If the designated target is a living creature, these attacks gain the death trait. If the designated target dies as a result of this tactic, all other enemies within the affected area of your commander's banner must succeed at a `Will check` save against your class DC or be [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]]; this is an emotion, fear, and mental effect.

* * *

**Special** If one of your squadmates knows or has prepared a cantrip with a range of 30 feet or more that deals damage and requires 2 or fewer actions to cast, they can cast it targeting the designated enemy instead of taking the other actions normally granted by this tactic, gaining all other listed benefits.
