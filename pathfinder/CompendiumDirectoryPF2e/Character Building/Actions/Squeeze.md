# Squeeze

### [[exploration]][[move]]

**Category** interaction; 




You contort yourself to squeeze through a space so small you can barely fit through. This action is for exceptionally small spaces; many tight spaces are difficult terrain that you can move through more quickly and without a check.

* * *

**Critical Success** You squeeze through the tight space in 1 minute per 10 feet of squeezing.

**Success** You squeeze through in 1 minute per 5 feet.

**Critical Failure** You become stuck in the tight space. While you're stuck, you can spend 1 minute attempting another Acrobatics check at the same DC. Any result on that check other than a critical failure causes you to become unstuck.

## Sample Squeeze Tasks

*   **Trained** space barely fitting your shoulders
*   **Master** space barely fitting your head
