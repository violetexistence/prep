# Designate Ally `pf2:1`

### 

**Category** interaction; 




Choose an ally you can see, who becomes your designated ally. For the next minute, whenever your designated ally is adjacent to you and you're conscious, they gain a +2 circumstance bonus to AC and Reflex saving throws. You can have only one designated ally at a time, and if you designate a new ally, the previous ally loses any benefits.
