# Double Team `pf2:2`

### [[commander]][[tactic]]

**Category** offensive; 




Your team works together to set an enemy up for a vicious attack. Signal one squadmate who has an opponent within their reach. That ally can [[Actions/Shove|Shove]] or [[Actions/Reposition|Reposition]] an opponent as a free action. If their maneuver is successful and the target ends their movement adjacent to a different squadmate, the second squadmate can attempt a melee Strike against that target as a reaction.
