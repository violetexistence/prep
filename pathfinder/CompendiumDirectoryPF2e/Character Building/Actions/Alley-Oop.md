# Alley-Oop `pf2:1`

### [[commander]][[tactic]]

**Category** offensive; 




Your team excels at sharing resources and delivering them exactly where they need to be. Signal a squadmate within the aura of your banner who is holding or wearing a consumable that can be activated as a single action. That squadmate can toss their consumable to any other squadmate within the aura of your banner as a free action, and the receiving squadmate can catch and activate the consumable as a reaction. If the receiving squadmate chooses not to catch the consumable or if they don't have a free hand to catch it with, it lands on the ground in their space.

* * *

**Special** If the consumable is a piece of activated ammunition and the receiving squadmate is wielding a compatible weapon that takes 1 or fewer actions to reload, they can load the ammunition into their weapon as part of the reaction used to catch and activate it. The ammunition remains activated until the end of their next turn.
