# Overdrive `pf2:1`

### [[inventor]][[manipulate]]

**Category** offensive; 




**Frequency** once per round

* * *

Temporarily cranking the gizmos on your body into overdrive, you try to add greater power to your attacks. Attempt a `Crafting check` check that has a standard DC for your level.

[[Feat_Feature Effects/Effect_ Overdrive|Effect: Overdrive]]

* * *

**Critical Success** Your gizmos go into a state of incredible efficiency called critical overdrive, adding great power to your attacks. Your Strikes deal additional damage equal to your Intelligence modifier for 1 minute. After the Overdrive ends, your gizmos become unusable as they cool down or reset, and you can't use Overdrive for 1 minute.

**Success** Your gizmos go into overdrive, adding power to your attacks. As critical success, except the additional damage is equal to half your Intelligence modifier.

**Failure** Your gizmos whine concerningly and begin to smoke. Your Strikes deal 1 additional fire damage.

**Critical Failure** Whoops! Something explodes. You take fire damage equal to half your level (rounded up), and you can't use Overdrive again for 1d4 rounds as your gizmos reset.

* * *

**Special** When under the effects of Overdrive, you can still use the Overdrive action. You can't extend your Overdrive's duration this way, but you can turn an overdrive into a critical overdrive if you critically succeed. A failure has no effect on your current Overdrive, and you end your Overdrive on a critical failure.
