# Forced Pact `pf2:1`

### [[concentrate]]

**Category** offensive; 




**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

**Effect** You force a temporary pact on both yourself and another creature you can see within 60 feet. Choose attack, move, manipulate, or concentrate. The target must attempt a Will saving throw.

* * *

**Success** The target is unaffected.

**Failure** If you or the target uses an action with the chosen trait within the next minute, they take 10d6 mental damage, and this pact ends for both of you.

**Critical Failure** As failure, except your target takes the damage if either of you uses an action with the chosen trait.
