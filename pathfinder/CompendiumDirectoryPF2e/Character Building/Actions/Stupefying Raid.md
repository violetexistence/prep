# Stupefying Raid `pf2:2`

### [[commander]][[tactic]]

**Category** offensive; 




Your team dashes about in a series of maneuvers that leave the enemy befuddled. Signal up to two squadmates within the aura of your commander's banner; these squadmates can Stride up to their Speed as a reaction. Each enemy they are adjacent to at any point during this movement must attempt a `Will check` save against your class DC or become [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] for 1 round ([[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] on a critical failure); this is a mental effect.
