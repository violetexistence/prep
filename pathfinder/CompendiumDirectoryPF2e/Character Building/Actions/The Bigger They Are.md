# The Bigger They Are `pf2:1`

### [[brandish]][[commander]][[tactic]]

**Category** offensive; 




Regardless of your individual strengths, collectively your squad has the power to move mountains and topple giants. Signal a squadmate within the aura of your commander's banner. That squadmate can attempt to [[Actions/Reposition|Reposition]], [[Actions/Shove|Shove]], or [[Actions/Trip|Trip]] a target within their reach. Each other squadmate who is adjacent to the original squadmate or the target can attempt to assist with the maneuver as a reaction

For each squadmate who assists in this way, the original squadmate increases the maximum size of creature they can target (for example, if a total of two squadmates participated in this maneuver, the initial squadmate could target a creature up to two sizes larger than them.) The original squadmate gains a circumstance bonus on their check to Reposition, Shove, or Trip equal to the number of additional squadmates who assisted in the maneuver (maximum +4).
