# Take Cover `pf2:1`

### 

**Category** interaction; 




**Requirements** You are benefiting from cover, are near a feature that allows you to take cover, or are [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]].

* * *

You press yourself against a wall or duck behind an obstacle to take better advantage of cover. If you would have standard cover, you instead gain greater cover, which provides a +4 circumstance bonus to AC; to Reflex saves against area effects; and to Stealth checks to [[Actions/Hide|Hide]], [[Actions/Sneak|Sneak]], or otherwise avoid detection. Otherwise, you gain the benefits of standard cover (a +2 circumstance bonus instead). This lasts until you move from your current space, use an attack action, become [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]], or end this effect as a free action.
