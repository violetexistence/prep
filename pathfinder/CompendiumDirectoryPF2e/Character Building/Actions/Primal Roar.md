# Primal Roar `pf2:2`

### [[auditory]][[eidolon]]

**Category** offensive; 




Your eidolon unleashes a primal roar or other such terrifying noise that fits your eidolon's form. Your eidolon attempts Intimidation checks to [[Actions/demoralize|demoralize]] each enemy that can hear the roar; these Demoralize attempts don't take any penalty for not sharing a language.
