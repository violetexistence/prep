# Palm an Object `pf2:1`

### [[manipulate]]

**Category** interaction; 




You pick up a small, unattended object and try not to be noticed. Roll a single [[Actions/palm-an-object|palm-an-object]]{Thievery} check against the Perception DCs of all creatures who are currently observing you. You can typically only Palm Objects of negligible Bulk, though the GM might determine otherwise depending on the situation.

* * *

**Success** The creature doesn't notice you Palming the Object.

**Failure** The creature notices you Palming the Object.
