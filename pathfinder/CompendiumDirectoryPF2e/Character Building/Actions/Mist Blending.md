# Mist Blending `pf2:r`

### [[undine]]

**Category** defensive; 




**Trigger** A creature attempts a flat check to target you because you're [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] or [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] due to fog, haze, mist, or smoke

* * *

**Effect** You shroud yourself in mist, making it harder for your foe to hit you. If you're concealed, the DC of the flat check increases from 5 to `DC 7 Flat check`; if you're hidden, it increases from 11 to `DC 13 Flat check`.
