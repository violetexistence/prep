# Primal Howl `pf2:2`

### [[primal]][[sonic]]

**Category** offensive; 




**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

**Effect** Your animal companion screeches and howls, empowered with natural magic. All creatures in a 30-foot cone take 0d6 sonic damage for every 2 levels your companion has, with a `Fortitude check` save against your spell DC. Creatures that fail become [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]], and creatures that critically fail become [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]]. The fright is an emotion, fear, and mental effect.
