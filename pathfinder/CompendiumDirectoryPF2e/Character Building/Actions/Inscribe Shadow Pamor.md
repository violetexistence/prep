# Inscribe Shadow Pamor `pf2:1`

### [[occult]][[shadow]]

**Category** offensive; 




**Frequency** once per minute

* * *

**Effect** You plunge your fist or weapon into your shadow, enveloping it in a rippling, damask-like pattern of darkness. If your next action is to Strike, the shadows cling to your foe with your attack, obscuring its vision. On a hit, the target of your Strike becomes [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] until the start of your next turn. The target can use an Interact action to tear away the clinging shadows and remove the dazzled condition. On a critical hit, the shadows are particularly stubborn and can't be torn away.
