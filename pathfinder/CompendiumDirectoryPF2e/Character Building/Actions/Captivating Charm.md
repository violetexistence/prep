# Captivating Charm `pf2:2`

### [[concentrate]][[emotion]][[mental]][[transcendence]][[visual]]






You focus your attention on a creature within 30 feet, overwhelming its senses. The creature must succeed at a `Will check` save against your class DC or be [[Conditions/Fascinated|Fascinated]] by you until the start of your next turn. The condition ends if you use a hostile action against the target, but not if you use a hostile action against its allies.
