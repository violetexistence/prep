# Avoid Notice

### [[exploration]]

**Category** defensive; 




You attempt a Stealth check to avoid notice while traveling at half speed. If you're Avoiding Notice at the start of an encounter, you usually roll a Stealth check instead of a Perception check both to determine your initiative and to see if the enemies notice you (based on their Perception DCs, as normal for [[Actions/Sneak|Sneak]], regardless of their initiative check results).
