# Enter Spirit Trance `pf2:1`

### [[concentrate]][[divine]][[mental]]






You enter a self-imposed trance that helps you push the physical limits of your body. You gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to your level plus your Constitution modifier. The trance lasts for 1 minute, until you fall [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]], or until you Dismiss it, whichever comes first.

While in this trance, you gain a +1 status bonus to Fortitude and Will saving throws and your melee Strikes deal 1 additional spirit damage. Other abilities may require you to be in a spirit trance. When the trance ends, you lose any remaining temporary Hit Points from Enter Spirit Trance, and you can't Enter a Spirit Trance for 1 minute.
