# Feral Swing `pf2:2`

### [[spirit]][[transcendence]]






You lash out with both arms, rending all before you. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must succeed at a `Reflex check` save against your class DC or take spirit damage equal to your normal Strike damage with your [[Class Features/Hands of the Wildling|Hands of the Wildling]].

You can choose to swing with abandon, which imposes a â€“2 circumstance bonus to enemies' saving throws, but causes you to become [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the start of your next turn.
