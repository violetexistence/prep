# Ring Bell `pf2:r`

### [[auditory]][[emotion]][[magical]][[manipulate]][[mental]][[thaumaturge]]

**Category** defensive; 




**Trigger** The target of your Exploit Vulnerability makes a Strike or Casts a Spell that would affect you or one of your allies.

**Requirements** You are holding your bell implement, and the triggering creature is within 30 feet of you.

* * *

Your implement sings out abruptly, disrupting your foe. The piece played depends on whether the trigger was a Strike or Spell, and it applies to the triggering Strike or Spell, except where noted otherwise.

*   **Distracting Cacophony** The trigger is a spell. You create a musical crash of sonic energy that assails the target and breaks its concentration. The target must succeed at a `Fortitude check` save against your class DC or become [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] until the end of your next turn ([[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] on a critical failure). The target doesn't have to attempt a flat check to avoid losing the triggering spell, but the discordant ring does lower the spell attack roll or spell DC of the triggering spell from stupefied.
*   **Disrupting Harmony** The trigger is a Strike. You create a strangely discordant harmony that sinks into your foe's mind and throws its movements off. The target must succeed at a `Will check` save against your class DC or become your choice of [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]] or [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] until the end of your next turn ([[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 2]] or [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 2]] on a critical failure).
