# Mirror-Trickery `pf2:r`

### [[concentrate]][[illusion]][[occult]][[visual]]

**Category** defensive; 




**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** You would be hit by a Strike

* * *

**Effect** You create an illusory duplicate at the last instant and attempt to trick your foe into striking it instead of you. The attacker attempts a `DC 11 Flat check`; on a failure, the attack hits the duplicate, changing the result from a critical success to a success or a success to a failure.
