# Repeat a Spell

### [[concentrate]][[exploration]]

**Category** interaction; 




You repeatedly cast the same spell while moving at half speed. Typically, this spell is a cantrip that you want to have in effect in the event a combat breaks out, and it must be one you can cast in 2 actions or fewer. Repeating a spell that requires making complex decisions, such as [[Spells/Figment|Figment]], can make you [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]], as determined by the GM.
