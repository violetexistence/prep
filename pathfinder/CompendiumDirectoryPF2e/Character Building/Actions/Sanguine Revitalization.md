# Sanguine Revitalization `pf2:2`

### [[commander]][[tactic]]

**Category** offensive; 




**Frequency** once per day

* * *

Your squad is rejuvenated by the arterial spray of your enemies. Choose a creature within the aura of your commander's banner and signal all squadmates within the aura who are wielding a piercing or slashing melee weapon, or who have a piercing or slashing melee unarmed attack. Those allies can Stride up to half their Speed as a free action. If they end this movement within reach of the designated target, they can Strike the target with the required weapon or unarmed attack as a reaction.

Once all Strikes are completed, if the target took damage and is not immune to bleed damage, it must succeed at a `Fortitude check` saving throw against your class DC or take 10 points of persistent bleed damage. The target takes a circumstance penalty on their save equal to the number of successful Strikes made as part of this tactic (up to a maximum â€“4 circumstance penalty).

Your squadmates are energized by the display of your enemy's imminent defeat; each squadmate in a 20-foot emanation is healed for 10d6 healing Hit Points.
