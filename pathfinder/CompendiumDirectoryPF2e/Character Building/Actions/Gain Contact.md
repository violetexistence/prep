# Gain Contact

### [[downtime]]

You try to make contact with an individual who can aid you in the infiltration. Attempt a normal, hard, or very hard DC Diplomacy or Society check, or a check using a Lore skill appropriate to your prospective contact.

**Success** You make contact and gain 1 EP.

**Failure** You fail to make contact.

**Critical Failure** You insult or spook the contact in some way. Future attempts take a -2 circumstance penalty.
