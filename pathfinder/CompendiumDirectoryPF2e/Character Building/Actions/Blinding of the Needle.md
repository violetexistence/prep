# Blinding of the Needle `pf2:2`

### [[transcendence]]






You aim your weapon in a superficial cut above your opponent's eye. Make a Strike with the imbued ikon. If that Strike is successful, the target must succeed at a `Fortitude check` save against your class DC or become [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] for 1 round or until it uses an Interact action to clear the blood from its vision.
