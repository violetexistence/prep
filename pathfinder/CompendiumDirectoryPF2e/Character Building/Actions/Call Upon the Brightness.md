# Call Upon the Brightness `pf2:r`

### [[concentrate]]






**Trigger** You attempt an attack roll, skill check, or saving throw while performing the course of action from your [[Spells/Augury|Augury]], but you haven't rolled yet

* * *

You gain a +1 status bonus to the triggering check, or a +2 status bonus if the result of the augury was "woe" and you proceeded anyway.
