# Quick Tincture `pf2:1`

### [[investigator]][[manipulate]]

**Category** interaction; 




**Cost** 1 versatile vial

**Requirements** You know the formula for the alchemical item you're creating, you are holding or wearing alchemist's toolkit, and you have a free hand.

* * *

You quickly brew up a short-lived tincture. You create a single alchemical elixir or tool of your level or lower without having to spend the normal monetary cost in alchemical reagents or needing to attempt a Crafting check. This item has the infused trait, but it remains potent only until the end of the current turn.
