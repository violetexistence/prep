# Borrow an Arcane Spell

### [[concentrate]][[exploration]]






If you're an arcane spellcaster who prepares from a spellbook, you can attempt to prepare a spell from someone else's spellbook. The GM sets the DC for the check based on the spell's rank and rarity; it's typically a bit easier than [[Actions/Learn a Spell|Learning the Spell]].

* * *

**Success** You prepare the borrowed spell as part of your normal spell preparation.

**Failure** You fail to prepare the spell, but the spell slot remains available for you to prepare a different spell. You can't try to prepare this spell until the next time you prepare spells.
