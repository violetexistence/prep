# Fade Into Daydreams `pf2:1`

### [[illusion]][[psyche]][[psychic]]

**Category** defensive; 




Your flights of imagination spill into the real world, causing you to become indistinct, hazy, or cloaked in figments. You become [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] until the start of your next turn. This concealment can't be used to Hide, as normal for concealing effects that leave your location obvious.
