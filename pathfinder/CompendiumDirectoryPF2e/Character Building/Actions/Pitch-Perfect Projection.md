# Pitch-Perfect Projection `pf2:1`

### [[auditory]][[spellshape]]

**Category** offensive; 




By using your perfect pitch, you can amplify your voice to cause magical auditory effects to reach further. If your next action this round is to Cast a Spell or use an action that creates an auditory effect with a range, increase that range by 30 feet.
