# Guerrilla Assault `pf2:1`

### 

**Category** offensive; 




**Frequency** once per round

* * *

**Effect** You Interact to reload a sling or blowgun and then Strike. If the Strike is successful and you were undetected or unnoticed by the target when you made the attack, you are now [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] from the target after the attack, as they cannot tell where the attack came from.
