# Liar's Hidden Blade `pf2:1`

### [[spirit]][[transcendence]]






**Requirements** Your previous action was an unsuccessful Strike with the weapon from the [[Class Features/Shadow Sheath|Shadow Sheath]]

* * *

**Effect** The shadow weapon you threw fades, the distraction covering your true intention all alongâ€”a second strike in hidden in the blind spot of the first! Interact to draw another weapon from the shadow sheath, then Strike with it at the same multiple attack penalty as the unsuccessful attack. The opponent is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] to this attack.

This Strike counts toward your multiple attack penalty as normal. After the Strike resolves, you can Interact to draw another weapon from the shadow sheath.
