# Disarm `pf2:1`

### [[attack]]

**Category** offensive; 




**Requirements** You have at least one hand free. The target can't be more than one size larger than you.

* * *

You try to knock an item out of a creature's grasp. Attempt an [[Actions/disarm|disarm]]{Athletics} check against the target's Reflex DC.

* * *

**Critical Success** You knock the item out of the target's grasp. It falls to the ground in the target's space.

**Success** You weaken your target's grasp on the item. Further attempts to [[Actions/Disarm|Disarm]] the target of that item gain a +2 circumstance bonus, and the target takes a â€“2 circumstance penalty to attacks with the item or other checks requiring a firm grasp on the item. The creature can end the effect by Interacting to change its grip on the item; otherwise, it lasts as long as the creature holds the item.

[[Other Effects/Effect_ Disarm (Success)|Effect: Disarm (Success)]]

**Critical Failure** You lose your balance and become [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the start of your next turn.
