# Call on Ancient Blood `pf2:r`

### 






**Trigger** You attempt a saving throw against a magical effect, but you haven't rolled yet

* * *

Your ancestors' innate resistance to magic surges before slowly ebbing down. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws on the triggering save and other saves against magical effects until the end of this turn.
