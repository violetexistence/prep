# Rearrange Bones `pf2:1`

### [[manipulate]]

**Category** offensive; 




You arrange your bones into the form of a Small or Medium humanoid's skeleton. This doesn't change your normal Speeds, Strikes, or senses. If you are wearing heavy clothing or impersonating a skeleton, this counts as setting up a disguise for the Impersonate use of Deception and grants a +1 status bonus to those Deception checks.
