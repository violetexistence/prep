# Piranha Assault `pf2:1`

### [[commander]][[tactic]]

**Category** offensive; 




**Frequency** once per 10 minutes

* * *

You know that a thousand small bites can fell a large foe just as surely a single well-placed hit. Designate a creature within the aura of your commander's banner and signal all squadmates; for 1 minute, each time they attack that creature and deal damage to it of a type the creature resists, they ignore an amount of that creature's resistance equal to your level.
