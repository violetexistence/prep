###

**Trigger** An enemy casts a spell that targets you or an ally within 15 feet of you

You interpose your shield's ward against the spell. Attempt a counteract check, using your Religion modifier as your counteract modifier. On a success, the spell is counteracted and your shield takes damage equal to four times the spell rank as it absorbs and disperses the magical energy. On a failure, the shield takes damage equal to twice the spell's rank.
