# Topple the Pillar of Heaven `pf2:2`

### [[transcendence]]






Your ikon extends to an impossible length, striking all in its way. You deal 6d8 untyped damage to all creatures in a 60-foot line, with a `Reflex check` save against your class DC. The damage type matches that of your weapon. At 14th level and every two levels thereafter, the damage increases by 1d8.
