# Historical Reenactor

### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")






To Clan Tolorr, history shouldn't be dry and boring; it deserves to be engaging and made relevant to the living. You couldn't agree more! Whether it's your hobby or career, you've developed a reputation for translating the past into the present through demonstrations, period performances, acting out famous events, donning replica armor, and other feats of living historyâ€”filling in a few historical blanks if it makes a better show. Having learned of your passion, Clan Tolorr has sponsored your visit to Highhelm so that you can learn from each other. It's a wonderful opportunity, and Tolorr puppetry arts, storytelling, props, and historical rigor are the stuff of legends. Already, you've begun researching dwarven history so that you're prepared for whatever lies ahead.
