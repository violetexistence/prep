# Zodiac Bound

### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")






Fortune tellers and oracles claim that a person's zodiac sign influences their personality and fate, and while it might not be true for all, it seems true for you. You were born under a powerful manifestation of a specific constellation, corresponding to a symbol of the zodiac. When you gain this background, choose a specific constellation from those listed below. Your associated constellation determines one of the attribute boosts you gain and an innate spell. The list includes benefits for the constellations of the Dragon Empires Zodiac, but you might have been born under a different constellation and gain different benefits as determined by the GM.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to the attribute tied to your sign, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in Astrology Lore. You also gain the ability to cast a divine innate spell, as determined by your sign. The frequency with which you can cast this spell is listed below; cantrips can be used as often as you wish. As normal, you cast non-cantrip innate spells at the lowest rank available to that spell, such as 2nd rank for _water breathing_, and cantrips are heightened to half your level. Additionally, once during the prominent time for your sign (typically once per year), you can cast your sign's spell without expending its normal use.
