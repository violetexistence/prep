# Haunted Citizen

### 






You grew up in a region where undead lurk everywhere. This could be a domain as small as a vampire's fief or as vast as the nation of Ustalav. As an ever-present concern, the undead greatly shaped your life. Living with fear became an everyday skill... as did pleading for your life.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Wisdom** or **Charisma**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Diplomacy skill and the Lore skill for your home settlement. You gain the [[Feats/No Cause for Alarm|No Cause for Alarm]] skill feat.
