# Osprey Scribe

### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")






Either as a punishment or because of political ambition, you work for Elder Vandous. On her trip to Iron Harbor, Elder Ordwi needs someone at her side who is a skilled observer and adept at keeping journals; she hopes to provide the other elders with accurate information about their sibling village upon her return.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Intelligence** or **Charisma**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Society skill and the Demon Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Streetwise|Streetwise]] skill feat.
