# Concordance Researcher

### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")






Tasked by the Concordance of Elements to research a variety of enigmatic planar phenomena, you've acquired very specific knowledge about the planes and the interactions between them. While being a researcher is usually a peaceful profession, the Concordance might require you to go out into the field and research unstable planar situations.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Intelligence** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in four of the following: Plane of Air Lore, Plane of Earth Lore, Plane of Fire Lore, Plane of Metal Lore, Plane of Water Lore, or Plane of Wood Lore.
