# Blow-In

### 






You never expected to join a circus, but you were looking for a good place to lie low for reasons of your own. The Circus of Wayward Wonders came together with several different workers and performers a few months ago. Many came from a circus in Escadar called the Celestial Menagerie, but not all of them. It was easy to slip in among the roustabouts. Although you'd planned to move on quickly, the circus folk have adopted you as one of their own, and they don't ask questions about your past.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Charisma**, and one is a free attribute boost.
