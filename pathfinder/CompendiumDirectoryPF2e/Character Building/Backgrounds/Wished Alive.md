# Wished Alive

### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")






Once you were a simple construct or inanimate doll, but due to a deeply felt wish, either yours or another's, you came to life, and so you're now a living, breathing creature.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Charisma**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Diplomacy skill. Once per day, you can fervently wish for something you could work towards achieving as a single action which has the concentrate trait. If you do, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on the first skill check you attempt before the end of your turn to fulfill that wish.
