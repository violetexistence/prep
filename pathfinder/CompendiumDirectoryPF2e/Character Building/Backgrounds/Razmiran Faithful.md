# Razmiran Faithful

### 






**Prerequisite** Region - Broken Lands

* * *

You serve a living god who rules upon the face of Golarion, and this gives your actions a divine mandate not to be trifled with.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Charisma**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Intimidation skill and the Razmir Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Group Coercion|Group Coercion]] skill feat.
