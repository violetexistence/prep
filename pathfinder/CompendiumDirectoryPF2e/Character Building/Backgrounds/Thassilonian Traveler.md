# Thassilonian Traveler

### 






**Prerequisite** Region - Saga Lands

* * *

You come from ancient Thassilon, one of the citizens that appeared out of time alongside the city of Xin-Edasseril. You know many things that have been long forgotten... along with many things that are no longer correct.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Intelligence**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Arcana skill and the Thassilon Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Dubious Knowledge|Dubious Knowledge]] skill feat.
