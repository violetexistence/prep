# Megafauna Hunter

### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")






Life is only as meaningful as its risks, and the risks you're willing to take are big indeed. Like Wipa's half-sister Panuaku, Mammoth Lord Merthig, and Eiwa's great-grandnephew Pakano, you revel in the thrill of the hunt, especially when it involves mortal combat with megafauna, dinosaurs, and other oversized beasts. Though you're still early in your hunting career, your talent shows great promise, and you have a natural knack for tracking and taking down big game such as moose, saber-toothed tigers, and even wild mammoths.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Dexterity**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Athletics skill and the Hunting Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Titan Wrestler|Titan Wrestler]] skill feat.
