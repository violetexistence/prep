You have spent your youth wandering the lands of Varisia and beyond among the brightly painted wagons of a Varisian caravan. You have heard endless tales of your people's history and lore, and have learned many songs and stories from the disparate people you have met.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Charisma**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Performance skill and the Circus Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Fascinating Performance|Fascinating Performance]] skill feat.
