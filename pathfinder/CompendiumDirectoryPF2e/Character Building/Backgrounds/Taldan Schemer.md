# Taldan Schemer

### 






**Prerequisite** Region - Shining Kingdoms

* * *

Whether willing or unwilling, you have been involved in the many cutthroat political intrigues within Taldor. You might have been born into it as a member of the aristocracy, or you might have taken an active role in the recent events of the War for the Crown.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Charisma** or **Constitution**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Diplomacy skill and the Politics Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Hobnobber|Hobnobber]] skill feat.
