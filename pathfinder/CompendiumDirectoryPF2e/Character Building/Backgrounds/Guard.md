# Guard

### 






You served in the guard, out of either patriotism or the need for coin. Either way, you know how to get a difficult suspect to talk. However you left the guard, you might think of adventuring as a way to use your skills on a wider stage.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Charisma**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Intimidation skill and the Legal Lore or Warfare Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Quick Coercion|Quick Coercion]] skill feat.
