# Almas Clerk

### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")






You worked as a clerk at the Golden Cathedral of Almas in Andoran. The Pathfinder Society's activities in the city, and its passionate defense of its mission, inspired you to join the organization. You help the Society pursue its goals and navigate the laws of Golarion's many locales.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Intelligence** or **Charisma**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Society skill and the Legal Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Glean Contents|Glean Contents]] skill feat.

Additionally, when you receive a mission briefing in the city of Almas, you know just how to find the information you need. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your checks to Gather Information or Recall Knowledge during the Getting Started segment of such adventures. Be sure to remind your GM that you have a relevant background.
