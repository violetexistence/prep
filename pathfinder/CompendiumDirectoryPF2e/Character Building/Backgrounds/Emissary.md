# Emissary

### 






As a diplomat or messenger, you traveled to lands far and wide. Communicating with new people and forming alliances were your stock and trade.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Intelligence** or **Charisma**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Society skill and a Lore skill related to one city you've visited often. You gain the [[Feats/Multilingual|Multilingual]] skill feat.
