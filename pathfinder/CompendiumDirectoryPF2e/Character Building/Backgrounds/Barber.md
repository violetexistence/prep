# Barber

### 






Haircuts, dentistry, bloodletting, and surgeryâ€”if it takes a steady hand and a razor, you can do it. You may have taken to the road to expand your skills or test yourself against a world that leaves your patients so battered and bruised.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Medicine skill and the Surgery Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Risky Surgery|Risky Surgery]] skill feat.
