# Conservator

### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")






Some history survives only so long as its physical remains do. You've developed robust museum skills to identify relics, preserve artifacts, recreate ancient technologies, and even rebuild shattered treasuresâ€”often with painstaking patience, a steady hand, and even a little magic. Your contributions don't end there, as whether you've mastered diligent recordkeeping or helped uncover smuggling rings that are looting archaeological sites, you've made an impression. Hearing of your promising abilities, representatives from Clan Tolorr contacted you, inviting you to study with their museum masters and share your own techniques, all while helping preserve over 10,000 years of history!
