# Touched by Dahak

### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")






**\[Legacy - Age of Ashes\]**

As the manifestation of Dahak was destroyed, a shard of the dragon god's wrathful nature infused you, resulting in a violent temper, strange apocalyptic dreams, an obsession with dragon hunting, or some other touch of his influence.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Charisma**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Athletics skill and the Dragon Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Titan Wrestler|Titan Wrestler]] skill feat.
