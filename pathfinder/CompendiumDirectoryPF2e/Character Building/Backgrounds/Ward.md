# Ward

### 






When you were young, you became the ward of another houseâ€”boarded, fed, and educated, but never quite a part of the family. Perhaps you had to tend to their needs in return for feeding and raising you, or perhaps you were provided for but disregarded. Now, adventuring is your chance to grow and roam free.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Charisma**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Performance skill and the Genealogy Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Fascinating Performance|Fascinating Performance]] skill feat.
