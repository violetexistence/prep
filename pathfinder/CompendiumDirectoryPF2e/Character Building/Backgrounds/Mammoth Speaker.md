# Mammoth Speaker

### 






**Prerequisite** Region - Saga Lands

* * *

You have learned the secrets of taming the mighty mammoths and other megafauna of the far north. Perhaps these talents are a part of your people's traditional customs, or perhaps you sought out these massive animals of your own accord.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Nature skill and the Animal Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Train Animal|Train Animal]] skill feat.
