# Lastwall Survivor

### 






**Prerequisite** Region - Eye of Dread

* * *

You managed to escape the devastation that the Whispering Tyrant brought to your nation, but you lost everything to the lich-king's minions, including your home and many friends and family.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Medicine skill and the Undead Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Battle Medicine|Battle Medicine]] skill feat.
