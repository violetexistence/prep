# Nexian Mystic

### 






**Prerequisite** Region - Impossible Lands

* * *

Your initiations into the Nexian mysteries and the philosophies of the Arclords of Nex grant you a preternatural comprehension of the arcane underpinnings of existence.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Intelligence** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Arcana skill and a Lore skill related to one plane of your choice (other than the Material Plane). You gain the [[Feats/Arcane Sense|Arcane Sense]] skill feat.
