# Party Scholar

### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")






Perhaps because you already achieved what you wanted at school or your position makes you invulnerable, you've begun to pour your efforts into a lifestyle of hedonistic excess. The fact that the Convocation isn't a months-long party might thus come as a rude shock to you, but your skill at deflecting blame and making fast friends might mitigate that.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Charisma**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in Deception. You're also trained in the Alcohol Lore skill or a Lore skill associated with your school. You gain the Charming Liar skill feat.
