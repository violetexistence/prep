You joined the fight against House Thrune. You may have helped liberate the nation of Ravounel, or you might be involved in another rebellion, such as Pezzack's, that studied Ravounel's successes.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Charisma**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Society skill and the Kintargo Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Streetwise|Streetwise]] skill feat.
