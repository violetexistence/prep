# Witch Wary

### 






**Prerequisite** Region - Saga Lands

* * *

You have little love or trust for spellcraft and those who practice it, and have developed a paranoid knack for recognizing such tricks. You are constantly on guard for the magic of witches and have been trained to spot the signs of those with minds affected by magic.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Intelligence**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Occultism skill and the Curse Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Oddity Identification|Oddity Identification]] skill feat.
