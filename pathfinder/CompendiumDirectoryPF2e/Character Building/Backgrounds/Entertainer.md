# Entertainer

### 






Through an education in the arts or sheer dogged practice, you learned to entertain crowds. You might have been an actor, a dancer, a musician, a street magician, or any other sort of performer.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Charisma**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Performance skill and the Theater Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Fascinating Performance|Fascinating Performance]] skill feat.
