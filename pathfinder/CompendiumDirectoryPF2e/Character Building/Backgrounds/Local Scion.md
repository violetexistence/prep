# Local Scion

### 






You're from Breachill and have lived there most, if not all, of your life. You might be the son or daughter of a well-known local adventuring family, or a family with a storied tradition of military or other martial service. You likely also have some sort of skill with your hands, as the people of Breachill are very self-sufficient.

The Call for Heroes is one of your hometown's most iconic traditions, and you want to attend so you can prove your own merits to the council-beyond simply those of your family's name.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Charisma**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Crafting skill and the Breachill Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Specialty Crafting|Specialty Crafting]] skill feat.
