# Artisan

### 






As an apprentice, you practiced a particular form of building or crafting, developing a specialized skill. You might have been a blacksmith's apprentice toiling over the forge for countless hours, a young tailor sewing garments of all kinds, or a shipwright shaping the hulls of ships.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Intelligence**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Crafting skill and the Guild Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Specialty Crafting|Specialty Crafting]] skill feat.
