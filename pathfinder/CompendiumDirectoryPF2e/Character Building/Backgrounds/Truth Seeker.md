# Truth Seeker

### 






Whether you are a local or from out of town, you've heard rumors that Breachill's past contains a hidden secret. Perhaps you've heard strange rumors that the town's founder, Lamond Breachton, was not the hero everyone touts, or maybe your grandmother heard stories from her own grandmother that contradict the town's accepted narrative of its establishment. In the pursuit of the truth, you've learned to navigate the tangles of politics, and to never take anyone's word at face value.

You plan to join the Call for Heroes so that you can make yourself known to the council, or perhaps even ingratiating yourself to them, so you can seek the truth and eventually uncover Breachill's secrets!

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Deception skill and the Politics Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Lie to Me|Lie to Me]] skill feat.
