# Rivethun Adherent

### 






**Prerequisite** Region - Shining Kingdoms

* * *

You have spent time learning the practices and traditions of the ancient Rivethun dwarven shamans and can recognize all sorts of magic. You may have chosen your own road since then, or you may remain an adherent of the philosophy.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Occultism skill and the Spirit Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Recognize Spell|Recognize Spell]] skill feat.
