# Magical Misfit

### 






You don't understand folks who claim that magical talent is some sort of burden or great responsibility; you've always used your magic to cause trouble and to escape the consequences. Whether becoming an adventurer is your attempt to make amends or just a new way to make some mischief, you're excited to see where it takes you, and you still delight in using your skills to get out of trouble.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Intelligence** or **Dexterity**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in Arcana and Underworld Lore. You gain the [[Feats/Trick Magic Item|Trick Magic Item]] skill feat.
