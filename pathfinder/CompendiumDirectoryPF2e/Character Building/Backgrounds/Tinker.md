# Tinker

### 






Creating all sorts of minor inventions scratches your itch for problem-solving. Your engineering skills take a particularly creative bent, and no one know what you'll come up with next. It might be a genius device with tremendous potential or it might explode.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Intelligence**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Crafting skill and the Engineering Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Specialty Crafting|Specialty Crafting]] skill feat.
