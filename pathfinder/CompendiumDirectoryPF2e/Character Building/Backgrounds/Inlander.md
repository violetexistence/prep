You grew up in an untamed region of the Isle of Kortos, and you know how to survive in the wild.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Survival skill and a Lore skill related to the terrain type associated with your home region (such as Hills Lore or Mountains Lore). You gain the [[Feats/Survey Wildlife|Survey Wildlife]] skill feat.
