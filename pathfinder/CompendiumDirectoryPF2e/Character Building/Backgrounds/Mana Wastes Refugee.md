# Mana Wastes Refugee

### 






**Prerequisite** Region - Impossible Lands

* * *

Exposure to the corrupting influence of the Mana Wastes' strange energies has warped your inner essence, resulting in unpredictable interactions with magic items and more than a little know-how about surviving under bizarre and adverse natural conditions.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Intelligence**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Arcana skill and the Wilderness Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Trick Magic Item|Trick Magic Item]] skill feat.
