# Storm Survivor

### 






**Prerequisite** Region - High Seas

Through luck or through skill, you managed to survive a catastrophic maritime disaster, such as a shipwreck or being thrown overboard. You have a keen sense for weather or situations that are similar to the one you escaped.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Survival skill and the Weather Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Forager|Forager]] skill feat.
