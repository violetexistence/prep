# Cook

### 






You grew up in the kitchens of a tavern or other dining establishment and excelled there, becoming an exceptional cook. Baking, cooking, a little brewing on the sideâ€”you've spent lots of time out of sight. It's about time you went out into the world to catch some sights for yourself.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Intelligence**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Survival skill and the Cooking Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Seasoned|Seasoned]] skill feat.
