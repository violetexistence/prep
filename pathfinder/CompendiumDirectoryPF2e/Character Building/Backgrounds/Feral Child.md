# Feral Child

### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")






You spent your youth in the wilderness, living close to or perhaps raised by animals. You have a close, mystical connection with these animals and gained certain abilities from them, though this limited your well-roundedness in mental pursuits.

Choose one ability boost. It must be **Strength**, **Dexterity**, or **Constitution**.

You are trained in Nature and Survival. You gain low-light vision (or darkvision if you already had low-light vision), imprecise scent with a range of 30 feet, and the [[Feats/Forager|Forager]] skill feat.
