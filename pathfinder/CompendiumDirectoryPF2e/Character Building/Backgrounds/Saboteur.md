# Saboteur

### 






Whether you do it for personal enjoyment or at the behest of a mercenary company or military organization, you have a knack for destroying things. You have a sense for an object or structure's weak spots and know where to deliver a hammer strike or alchemical bomb. You adventure to hone your skills or complete a particular mission.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Dexterity**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Thievery skill and the Engineering Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Concealing Legerdemain|Concealing Legerdemain]] skill feat.
