# Acupuncturist

### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")






**Access** Tian Xia origin

* * *

You've studied qi and its abilities to heal the body through assessment and regulating qi flow. You know occult techniques that originated in Chu Ye before its masters were driven away when oni took over. You might have encountered a master willing to teach an eager student or felt the relief of its practice on your own body, taking your interest to greater heights.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Wisdom** or **Dexterity**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in Medicine and Acupuncture Lore. You gain the Battle Medicine skill feat.
