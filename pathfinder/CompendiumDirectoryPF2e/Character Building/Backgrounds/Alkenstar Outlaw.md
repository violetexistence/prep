# Alkenstar Outlaw

### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")






You're an outlaw whose first crime was stealing the guns from Alkenstar's Gunworks which allowed you to commence a crime spree of epic proportions. You don't know where your road ends, but it's probably going to be a bloody affair. The life of an adventurer might even be a relief compared to a life forever on the run from Alkenstar authorities and their allies.

Choose two attribute boosts. One boost must be to **Dexterity** or **Constitution**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in Thievery and Underworld Lore. You gain the [[Feats/Subtle Theft|Subtle Theft]] skill feat.
