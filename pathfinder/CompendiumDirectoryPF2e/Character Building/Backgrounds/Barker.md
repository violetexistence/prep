# Barker

### 






You're skilled at shouting to catch and keep the attention of passersby. A few well-timed and forcefully spoken words not only get people to notice you but also engage them to respond to you. You may have previously worked as a crier or in a more formal barker capacity with Mistress Dusklight's Celestial Menagerie. Either way, your ability to bully a crowd is impressive.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Charisma**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Intimidation skill, and the Crowd Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Group Coercion|Group Coercion]] skill feat.
