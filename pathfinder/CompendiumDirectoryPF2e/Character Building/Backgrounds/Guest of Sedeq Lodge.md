# Guest of Sedeq Lodge

### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")






Either as a guest, event staff, or part of the construction crew, you spent a significant stretch of time at the Pathfinder Society's new lodge in Sedeq. The lodge serves as a new home for those fleeing from oppression or otherwise seeking a fresh start in Qadira. The magic and marvels you witnessed at the lodge inspired you to find more excitement as a member of the Pathfinder Society.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in your choice of the Arcana or Religion skills, as well as your choice of the Genie Lore or Sarenrae Lore skills. You gain the [[Feats/Recognize Spell|Recognize Spell]] skill feat.

Additionally, when you receive a mission briefing at Sedeq Lodge, your familiarity with the site and the nearby area comes in handy. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your checks to Gather Information or Recall Knowledge during the Getting Started segment of such adventures. Be sure to remind your GM that you have a relevant background.
