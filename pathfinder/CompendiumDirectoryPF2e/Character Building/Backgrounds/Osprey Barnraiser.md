# Osprey Barnraiser

### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")






A person cannot live on fish alone, which is why you work with Elder Bo'Mel on her farm. Elder Ordwi asked you to accompany her to Iron Harbor because she values your input in evaluating how the village might be making use of their natural resources.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Constitution**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Nature skill and the Architecture Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Natural Medicine|Natural Medicine]] skill feat.
