# Sailor

### 






You heard the call of the sea from a young age. Perhaps you signed onto a merchant's vessel, joined the navy, or even fell in with a crew of pirates and scalawags.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Dexterity**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Athletics skill and the Sailing Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Underwater Marauder|Underwater Marauder]] skill feat.
