# Wish for Riches

### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")






On the night of the Missing Moment, you saw visions of fabulous riches in the gate before you. Honestly, how someone could see anything but piles of jewels and gold is utterly baffling to you. Having pined for material wealth for as long as you could remember, you practically sprang into the portal in hopes of securing your fortune. The next moment, however, you were standing right where you'd just been, though indeterminate time had passed. You're no richer than before you walked through the gate, unfortunately, but perhaps you could use the new power you've manifested since returning to pursue your dreams of avarice anew.

Your deviant abilities are of either the dragon or leech classification. If you choose dragon, you gain the [[Feats/Consume Energy|Consume Energy]] deviant feat with the cold type. If you choose leech, you gain the [[Feats/Borrowed Ability|Borrowed Ability]] deviant feat. As a quirk, your deviant abilities manifest in a silver hue, and when you use a deviant ability you absorb the color silver from your surroundings. The absorbed color returns to your surroundings within an hour.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Charisma** or **Dexterity**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Thievery skill and the Games Lore skill. You gain the Subtle Theft skill feat.
