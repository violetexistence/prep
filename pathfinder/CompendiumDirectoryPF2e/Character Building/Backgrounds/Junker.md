# Junker

### 






You live on the outskirts of civilization, combing through the detritus left behind for interesting trinkets to sell or use in your own crafting. Though you have a preferred terrain to search, you know that the greatest treasures occur where people make greater use of technology.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Athletics skill and the Lore skill of the terrain in which you scavenge. You gain the [[Feats/Hefty Hauler|Hefty Hauler]] skill feat.
