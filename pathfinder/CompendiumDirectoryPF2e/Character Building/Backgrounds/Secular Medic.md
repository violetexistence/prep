# Secular Medic

### 






**Prerequisite** Region - Golden Road

* * *

You're from Rahadoum, where the Laws of Mortality taught you to reject the gods, yet you've seen firsthand how dangerous it can be to go without healing magic. As a result, you've thrown yourself into the study of medicine, so you can save lives without saving souls.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Wisdom** or **Dexterity**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Medicine skill and the Anatomy Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Battle Medicine|Battle Medicine]] skill feat.
