# Geb Crusader

### 






**Prerequisite** Region - Impossible Lands

* * *

You grew up considering the existence of the undead nation of Geb an atrocity and trained to one day take part in destroying it and putting its vile inhabitants to their final rest. Key to your preparations is a thorough study of Pharasma, Urgathoa, and other undead-related deities and their philosophies.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Religion skill and the Undead Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Student of the Canon|Student of the Canon]] skill feat.
