# Thrill-Seeker

### 






You once survived a life-or-death situation and found it surprisingly exhilarating, so now you chase that feeling of invincibility you only get when dancing with death. Your desire for exhilaration has you scaling buildings, leaping off rooftops, jumping chasms, and performing other deathdefying stunts.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Constitution**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You are trained in the Athletics skill and the Engineering Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Combat Climber|Combat Climber]] skill feat.
