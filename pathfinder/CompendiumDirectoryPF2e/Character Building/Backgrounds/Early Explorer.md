# Early Explorer

### 






In the past decade, the Pathfinder Society has clashed with demonic armies, meddled in politics, and more, but you joined the organization before everything seemed so complicated. Whether you're a dedicated scholar of ruins or an explorer who just longs for months-long expeditions into the wilderness, you're a Pathfinder to explore, report, and cooperate.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Survival skill and the Pathfinder Society Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Forager|Forager]] skill feat.

**Special** You can select this background only if you have earned credit for at least 5 First Edition scenarios from Seasons 0 of the Pathfinder Society organized play campaign.
