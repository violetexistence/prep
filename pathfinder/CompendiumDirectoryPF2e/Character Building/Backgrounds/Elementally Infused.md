# Elementally Infused

### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")






You were exposed to a strong burst of elemental essence originating directly from an elemental plane, most likely caused by a planar breach. Your body absorbed the elemental essence with no ill effects, and now it coalesces within you. With time, you've learned to project elemental power in a manner safe to you but still deadly to others.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Charisma**, and one is a free attribute boost.

Choose one elemental plane: Air, Earth, Fire, Metal, Water, or Wood. You are trained in the corresponding Lore skill: Plane of Air Lore, Plane of Earth Lore, Plane of Fire Lore, Plane of Metal Lore, Plane of Water Lore, or Plane of Wood Lore. You also gain a cantrip according to your chosen plane:

**Air:** [[Spells/Gale Blast|Gale Blast]]

**Earth:** [[Spells/Scatter Scree|Scatter Scree]]

**Fire:** [[Spells/Ignition|Ignition]]

**Metal:** [[Spells/Needle Darts|Needle Darts]]

**Water:**[[Spells/Spout|Spout]]

**Wood:** [[Spells/Root Reading|Root Reading]]

You can cast this spell as a primal innate spell at will.
