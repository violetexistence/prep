# Firebrand Follower

### 






You were once rescued or liberated from a hopeless situation by a group of Firebrands, and you have since aspired to become a Firebrand to continue their legacy. You still follow news of their adventures, and you hope to one day meet your heroes as comrades.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Charisma**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You are trained in your choice of the Athletics or Performance skill as well as the Firebrand Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Assurance|Assurance]] skill feat in your chosen skill.
