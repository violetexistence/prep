# Hermean Heritor

### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")






**\[Legacy - Age of Ashes\]**

With the restrictions on Hermean citizenship lifted, you may have fled the city of Promise or have spent some of your childhood in the company of someone who did.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Society skill and the Legal Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Multilingual|Multilingual]] skill feat or the [[Feats/Assurance|Assurance]] skill feat for Society.
