# Miner

### 






You earned a living wrenching precious minerals from the lightless depths of the earth. Adventuring might have seemed lucrative or glamorous compared to this backbreaking laborâ€”and if you have to head back underground, this time you plan to do so armed with a real weapon instead of a miner's pick.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Survival skill and the Mining Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Terrain Expertise|Terrain Expertise]] skill feat with underground terrain.
