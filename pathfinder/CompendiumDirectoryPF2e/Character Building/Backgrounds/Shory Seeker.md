# Shory Seeker

### 






You've dedicated your life to unraveling the secrets of the ancient Shory Empire, either through meticulous research or by traveling into dangerous and distant ruins to track down long-lost artifacts.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Intelligence**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Crafting skill and the Shory Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Specialty Crafting|Specialty Crafting]] skill feat.
