# Purveyor of the Bizarre

### 






**Prerequisite** Region - Golden Road

* * *

Whether in Katapesh or one of the bustling markets along the Path of Salt, you've spent enough time buying and selling ancient or unusual items to give you an instinctive ability to quickly sort valuable trinkets from worthless baubles.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Intelligence** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Arcana skill and the Mercantile Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Quick Identification|Quick Identification]] skill feat.
