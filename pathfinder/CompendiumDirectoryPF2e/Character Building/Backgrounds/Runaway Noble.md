# Runaway Noble

### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")






There are many reasons for noble blood to abandon their responsibilities. Whether you fled for safety, for love, to sate a spontaneous spark of rebellion, or to escape unbearable expectations, you've left your lavish life behind for one of newfound experiences. However, how prepared you are for a life on the road is something else entirely.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Charisma** or **Intelligence**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in Diplomacy, and either Genealogy Lore or Heraldry Lore. You gain the Bon Mot skill feat.
