# Artist

### 






Your art is your greatest passion, whatever form it takes. Adventuring might help you find inspiration, or simply be a way to survive until you become a world-famous artist.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Charisma**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Crafting skill and the Art Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Specialty Crafting|Specialty Crafting]] skill feat.
