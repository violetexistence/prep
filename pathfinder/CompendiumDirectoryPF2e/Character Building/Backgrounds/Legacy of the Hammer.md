# Legacy of the Hammer

### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")






Your introduction to the criminal life was spurred forward by a seemingly innocuous hammer that provided you with all kinds of innovative criminal ideas. It has since left your possession, but every now and then you hear a faint whisper urging you toward crime.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Charisma**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Thievery skill and Engineering Lore. You gain the [[Feats/Concealing Legerdemain|Concealing Legerdemain]] skill feat.
