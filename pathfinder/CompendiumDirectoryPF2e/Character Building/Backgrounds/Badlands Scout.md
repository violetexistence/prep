# Badlands Scout

### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")






You're accustomed to the desolate wilds of Belkzen and able to blend into the sparse shadows of craggy rocks and quench your thirst with drops of water. You might be a member of an isolated orc hold, traveling mercenary, or wandering warrior from nearby human settlements.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Survival skill and the Badlands Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Forager|Forager]] skill feat.
