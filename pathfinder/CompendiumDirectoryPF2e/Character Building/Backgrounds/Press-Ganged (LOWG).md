# Press-Ganged (LOWG)

### 






**Prerequisite** Region - High Seas

* * *

You were forced into service as a sailor against your will. Perhaps you were punished for a crime, were drafted into military service, are repaying a debt, or simply were abducted. Though you were initially trained as a simple deckhand, you may have subsequently studied a trade under one of the vessel's specialists.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Society skill and the Sailing Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Experienced Professional|Experienced Professional]] skill feat.
