# Grave Robber

### 






Resurrectionist. Body snatcher. No matter what you're called, you know where the bodies are buried, and how many coins they'll fetch when dug up. Adventuring comes naturally to you-in your mind dungeons are just oversized tombs-as does returning home with your loot undetected.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Dexterity**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Stealth skill and the Underworld Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Experienced Smuggler|Experienced Smuggler]] skill feat.
