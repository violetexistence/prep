# Martial Disciple

### 






You dedicated yourself to intense training and rigorous study to become a great warrior. The school you attended might have been a traditionalist monastery, an elite military academy, or the local branch of a prestigious mercenary organization.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Dexterity**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in your choice of the Acrobatics or Athletics skill. You gain a skill feat: [[Feats/Cat Fall|Cat Fall]] if you chose Acrobatics or [[Feats/Quick Jump|Quick Jump]] if you chose Athletics. You're also trained in the Warfare Lore skill.
