# Highborn Snoop

### 






The machinations and scheming of King's Crown have trained you to be on the lookout for those who seem out of place. You've learned to spot when the person pouring your tea has sword callusesâ€”or when the person wearing a guard's uniform doesn't.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be **Dexterity** or **Intelligence**, and the other is a free boost.

You're trained in the Society skill, and the Guild Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Courtly Graces|Courtly Graces]] skill feat.
