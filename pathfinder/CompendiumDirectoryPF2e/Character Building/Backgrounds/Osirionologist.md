# Osirionologist

### 






**Prerequisite** Region - Golden Road

* * *

Whether you're a fascinated outsider or a local proud of your nation's storied past, you're a devoted student of Osirion's history. You might be a traveling professor, a member of a society like the Pathfinders or the Esoteric Order of the Palatine Eye, or even a simple tomb robber cashing in on the glories of the past.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Intelligence**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Occultism skill and the Ancient Osirion Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Oddity Identification|Oddity Identification]] skill feat.
