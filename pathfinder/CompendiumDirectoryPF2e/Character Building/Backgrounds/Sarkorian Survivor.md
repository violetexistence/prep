# Sarkorian Survivor

### 






**Prerequisite** Region - Broken Lands

* * *

The devastation and carnage of the Worldwound were nearly complete, but you somehow managed to survive it.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Constitution**, and one is a free boost.

You're trained in the Survival skill and the Sarkorian History Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Forager|Forager]] skill feat.
