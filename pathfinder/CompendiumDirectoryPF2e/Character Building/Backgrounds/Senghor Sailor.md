# Senghor Sailor

### 






**Prerequisite** Region - Mwangi Expanse

* * *

As an experienced sailor from Senghor, you know that the only thing saving you from disaster on the high seas is a properly maintained ship. You know boat-building inside and out and you can quickly cobble together a solution in the event that something breaks.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Intelligence** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Crafting skill and the Sailing Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Quick Repair|Quick Repair]] skill feat.
