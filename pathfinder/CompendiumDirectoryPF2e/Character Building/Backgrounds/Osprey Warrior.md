# Osprey Warrior

### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")






You'd always been the most athletic child of your play group, leading the other children in games of skill and strategy. As an adult, there are few opportunities for you to employ these skills in the village. Osprey Cove is a quiet community, with hardly any dangers or foes to fight. You occasionally break up pub brawls, or perhaps start them out of boredom. Elder Ordwi asks you to come with her simply because of your endurance and athleticismâ€”the Old Coast Road is poorly maintained, and the physical aid you'll bring on the trip will likely be invaluable.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Constitution**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Athletics skill and the Gorum Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Hefty Hauler|Hefty Hauler]] skill feat.
