# Street Preacher

### 






Forget the church orthodoxy and the stuffy cloisters-spreading the word of your god to the people is your calling. You've preached on the street corners and in public houses, to wanderers on the road and to captives in the stocks. Adventuring can take you across the world. What vocation could better serve to take your holy words to fresh ears?

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Wisdom** or **Charisma**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Religion skill and the Lore skill for your patron deity. You gain the [[Feats/Dubious Knowledge|Dubious Knowledge]] skill feat.
