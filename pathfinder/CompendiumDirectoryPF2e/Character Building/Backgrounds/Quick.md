# Quick

### 






**Prerequisite** Region - Impossible Lands

* * *

Staying alive among the scheming, ravenous undead of Geb required a deep knowledge of their motivations, capabilities, and weaknesses. More often than not, it also required the ability to weave alibis and life-preserving half-truths capable of swaying a stilled heart.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Charisma** or **Constitution**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Deception skill and the Undead Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Charming Liar|Charming Liar]] skill feat.
