# Mortuarium Survivor

### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")






You studied the necromantic arts in the clawed tower of the Mortuarium, the most prestigious university of necromancy in Yled. Although your training was grueling, you graduated—or fled—with your body and mind intact; many of your peers weren't so lucky. You might continue studying necromancy on your own, or your experience might have soured you on the field, but the Mortuarium instilled in you a thorough knowledge of necromantic principles and inured you to the energies that animate the dead.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Intelligence**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in Arcana and Necromancy Lore. You gain the [[Actions/Inured to Death|Inured to Death]] reaction.
