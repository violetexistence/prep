# Final Blade Survivor

### 






**Prerequisite** Region - Shining Kingdoms

* * *

You fell prey to the whims of the Galtan mob and were scheduled for execution by _[[Equipment/Final Blade|Final Blade]]_, but through skill-or sheer luck-you managed to talk your way out of it.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Charisma** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Deception skill and the Revolution Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Charming Liar|Charming Liar]] skill feat.
