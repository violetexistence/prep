# Hermean Expatriate

### 






**Prerequisite** Region - High Seas

* * *

You have been exiled from Hermea, perhaps of your own accord or perhaps because you didn't measure up. However, you take with you some of the benefits of the excellent education afforded to its citizenry.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Intelligence** or **Charisma**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Society skill and the Dragon Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Skill Training|Skill Training]] skill feat.
