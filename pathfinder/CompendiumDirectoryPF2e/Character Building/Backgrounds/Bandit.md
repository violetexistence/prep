# Bandit

### 






Your past includes no small amount of rural banditry, robbing travelers on the road and scraping by. Whether your robbery was sanctioned by a local noble or you did so of your own accord, you eventually got caught up in the adventuring life.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Charisma**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Intimidation skill and a Lore skill related to the terrain you worked in (such as Desert Lore or Plains Lore). You gain the [[Feats/Group Coercion|Group Coercion]] skill feat.
