# Chosen One

### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")






Your birth has fulfilled a prediction, and people close to you are counting on you to do great things. There's intense pressure on you to be up to the task, and the fickle nature of prophecy complicates your path.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Charisma**, and one is a free attribute boost.

Decide with your GM the basics of the prophecy in which you're meant to play a major part. You're trained in one skill related to the prophecy, and the Fortune-Telling Lore skill. You gain the [[Actions/Prophecy's Pawn|Prophecy's Pawn]] free action.

_Note: You must select the skill manually and add the Prophecy's Pawn action_
