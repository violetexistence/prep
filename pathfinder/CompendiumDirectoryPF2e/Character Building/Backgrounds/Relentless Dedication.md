# Relentless Dedication

### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")






Recruiters invite many candidates like you to train to be Knights of Lastwall, but only a select few make the cut. Whereas others lose heart, your perseverance paid off. Your commitment to the cause is so clear, it overcame whatever disqualified your previous attempts to join the new Shining Crusade.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Constitution**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Warfare Lore skill, and you gain the [[Feats/Canny Acumen|Canny Acumen]] feat.
