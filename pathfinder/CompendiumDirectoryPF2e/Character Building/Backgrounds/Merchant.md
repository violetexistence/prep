# Merchant

### 






In a dusty shop, market stall, or merchant caravan, you bartered wares for coin and trade goods. The skills you picked up still apply in the adventuring life, in which a good deal on a suit of armor could prevent your death.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Intelligence** or **Charisma**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Diplomacy skill and the Mercantile Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Bargain Hunter|Bargain Hunter]] skill feat.
