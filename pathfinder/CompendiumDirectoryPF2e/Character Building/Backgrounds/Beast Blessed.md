# Beast Blessed

### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")






You once freed a magical beast from captivity and, whether it was intentional or a byproduct of another action, the grateful creature bestowed a blessing of freedom upon you. Your blessing manifests physically, perhaps as elongated canines, fingernails that grow to a sharp point, excess body hair, or some other feature. This physical manifestation is cosmetic and provides no benefit.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You are trained in the Survival skill. You gain the [[Actions/Bestial Clarity|Bestial Clarity]] reaction.
