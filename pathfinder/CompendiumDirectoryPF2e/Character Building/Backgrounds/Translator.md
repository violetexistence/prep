# Translator

### 






In your youth, you learned to transcribe books and translate scrolls to preserve knowledge or perhaps to aid wealthy merchants and politicians. Whether you set out to make your own fortune or are drawn to decipher the strangest codes, your linguistic training will guide your discoveries.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Intelligence** or **Charisma**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Society skill and the Scribing Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Multilingual|Multilingual]] skill feat.
