# Shielded Fortune

### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")






You've always been tougher than your peers. As a child, you may have been able to endure the rough-and-tumble horseplay with friends more easily. You regularly emerged relatively unscathed from accidents could have been quite dangerous. At some point in your past, you had a particularly close call with deathâ€”be it from a near-fatal accident, a fight gone horribly wrong, a close call with illness, or something similar, yet you quickly recovered. You may or may not believe you're more fated to face unexpected hardship in your life, but regardless, you know you can take what destiny has to dish out.

This background is associated with the suit of Shields.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Constitution**, and one is a free attribute boost. You gain the [[Feats/Toughness|Toughness]] general feat and also gain the [[Actions/Fated Not to Die|Fated Not to Die]] free action.
