# Streetfood Vendor

### 






You're an inspired chef, trying to make it as big as you can out on the open road. You travel with a wood or iron cart that doubles as your portable business and shelter. Struggling for funds or fighting for a place to set up shop are common plights in your daily life. However, there's no one hungrier than a budding adventurer, and you're very affordable, always there with the perfect meal.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Dexterity**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in either Crafting or Society, and Cooking Lore. You gain the Seasoned skill feat.
