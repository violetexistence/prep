# Child of the Puddles

### 






**Prerequisite** Region - Absalom and Starstone Isle

* * *

You grew up in the soggy, squalid quarter of Absalom known as the Puddles. You're at home in tightly packed urban environments.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Intelligence**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Acrobatics skill, and the Absalom Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Steady Balance|Steady Balance]] skill feat.
