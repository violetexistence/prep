# Hookclaw Digger

### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")






**Prerequisites** Kobold ancestry

You are a digger from the Hookclaw kobold tribe, born beneath the streets of Absalom, with muscles and mind hardened by years spent tunneling through rock and earth and a confidence built upon your pride in your draconic heritage.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Charisma**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Crafting skill, the Mining Lore skill, and the Engineering Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Improvise Tool|Improvise Tool]] skill feat.
