# Legendary Parents

### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")






**\[Legacy - Age of Ashes\]**

One or more of your parents (either biological or adoptive) were heroes of the Age of Ashes Adventure Path. Others tend to treat you with a bit more respect, or perhaps fear your connections to people of great power.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Charisma**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Intimidation skill, and the Genealogy Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Group Coercion|Group Coercion]] skill feat.
