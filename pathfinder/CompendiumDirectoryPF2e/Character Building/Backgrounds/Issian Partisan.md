### 






**Prerequisite** Region - Broken Lands

* * *

You grew up among the northern houses of Brevoy in old Issia. Steeped in the cultural legacy of pirates and smugglers, you rely on your cleverness and charm as you make your way throughout the world.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Intelligence** or **Charisma**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Deception skill and the Underworld Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Charming Liar|Charming Liar]] skill feat.
