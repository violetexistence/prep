# Broken Tusk Recruiter

### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")






Your gifted tongue, friendly demeanor, and deep knowledge of Broken Tusk culture and traditions make you an ideal recruiter for new followers. Whenever Broken Tusks come upon weak, weary, or wandering souls, you're often the first sent to meet these folks and determine if they would be a good fit for the following.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Charisma**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Diplomacy skill and the Hillcross Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Group Impression|Group Impression]] skill feat.
