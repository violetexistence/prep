# Scion of Slayers

### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")






You were born into a lineage of undead slayers. No mere occupation, in your family slaying is a mantle of almost mystic responsibility passed from parent to child. Over the generations, this single-minded focus has begun to manifest in uncanny ways during combat.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Intelligence**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Athletics skill and the Undead Lore skill. You can cast [[Spells/Vitality Lash|Vitality Lash]] as an innate divine cantrip. You can use Intelligence as your spellcasting ability for this innate spell.
