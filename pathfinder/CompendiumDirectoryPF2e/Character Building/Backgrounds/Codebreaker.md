# Codebreaker

### 






Whether you're employed by a military organization to decipher coded messages sent by enemy factions or work independently to crack an enigma created by a past civilization, you have a head for patterns and linguistics. You might even use new clockwork devices to aid you in your efforts.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Intelligence** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Society skill and the Cryptography Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Glean Contents|Glean Contents]] skill feat.
