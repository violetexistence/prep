# Scout

### 






You called the wilderness home as you found trails and guided travelers. Your wanderlust could have called you to the adventuring life, or perhaps you served as a scout for soldiers and found you liked battle.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Survival skill and a Lore skill related to one terrain you scouted in (such as Forest Lore or Cavern Lore). You gain the [[Feats/Forager|Forager]] skill feat.
