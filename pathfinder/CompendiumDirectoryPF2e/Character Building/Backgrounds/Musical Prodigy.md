# Musical Prodigy

### 






Ever since you were young, you've been almost supernaturally skilled in a particular type of music. The people around you were sure you'd grow up to perform at royal courts or to become a world-famous composer, but you've chosen a life of adventure instead. You might have given up on those dreams to find your own meaning, or you might find that adventuring allows you to experience unfiltered emotions and exploits that you can translate into a wondrous symphony some day.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Charisma**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in Performance and Music Lore. You gain the [[Feats/Virtuosic Performer|Virtuosic Performer]] skill feat.

_Note: You will have to select the correct virtuosic performer feat for your style._
