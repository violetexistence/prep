# Willing Host

### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")






You speak to spirits only you can perceive: wispy shreds of lost souls, household guardians, ancestral spirits, and other entities. You can negotiate with these beings, allowing them into your body to impart knowledge or aid in a task for the price of a favor.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Wisdom** or **Charisma**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Spirit Lore skill. You gain the [[Actions/Host Spirit|Host Spirit]] action.
