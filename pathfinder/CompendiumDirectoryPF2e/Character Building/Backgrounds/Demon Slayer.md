# Demon Slayer

### 






For over a century, Mendev led a multinational coalition against ever-growing abyssal invaders in the Worldwound, and the Pathfinder Society aided in the so-called Fifth Crusade that ultimately sealed the planar rift and defeated its demon armies. You might be a hardened recruit who clashed with the demons, or perhaps you were a survivor who lost everything to the fiendish armies and narrowly escaped-or was rescued by Pathfinders. Your exposure to the Worldwound has taught you vital lessons in identifying fiends and their magic.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Constitution**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Religion skill and the Demon Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Recognize Spell|Recognize Spell]] skill feat. Add **Abyssal** to the list of additional languages you can learn for having a high Intelligence modifier.
