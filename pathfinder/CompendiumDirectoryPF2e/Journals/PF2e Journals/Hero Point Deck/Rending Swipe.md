Play after making two successful consecutive melee Strikes against the same target with two different weapons.

The target takes 1d6 bleed and is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] until the bleeding stops. If you are 7th level or higher, increase the bleed to 2d6 bleed. If you are 12th level or higher, increase the bleed to 3d6 bleed.
