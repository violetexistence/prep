Play this after Casting a Spell.

* * *

The spell's power reverberates in your mind. You can Cast this Spell one additional time without having it prepared or expending a spell slot. If you don't Cast the Spell by the end of your next turn, it is lost. After Casting the Spell again, you become [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] for 1 minute.
