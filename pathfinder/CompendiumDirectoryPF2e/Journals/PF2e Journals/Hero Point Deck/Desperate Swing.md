Play during your turn.

* * *

Make a Strike, ignoring the multiple attack penalty. If you roll a critical success, you get a normal success instead. If the attack fails, you release your weapon, or drop [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] if you were using an unarmed attack or otherwise can't release your weapon.
