Mythic characters can gain their mythic power through a variety of means: it can be granted by a deity, gained by slaying a mythic monster or completing a mythic deed, acquired through exposure to a powerful artifact, obtained during an event when mythic power is unleashed over a large area (like the Godsrain), or via other means as determined by the GM and the story being told. Every character gains a mythic Calling when they first gain mythic power, which influences some of the fundamental nature of their power. They also gain mythic feats and, ultimately, a mythic destiny.

The following sections explain how becoming mythic affects a PC.

## Mythic Proficiency

Mythic characters have access to abilities that allow them to roll various checks using mythic proficiency instead of their normal proficiency. These abilities typically involve drawing on your reserves of mythic power to perform superhuman exploits that would be beyond normal mortal capabilities. Your proficiency bonus when using mythic proficiency is 10 plus your level. Mythic proficiency is the step above legendary proficiency, so a character attempting a check at mythic proficiency can complete any task that normally requires a specific proficiency, even if they wouldn't normally meet that requirement (such as disabling a hazard that normally requires expert or greater proficiency.)

Unlike trained, expert, master, and legendary proficiency, you use mythic proficiency only when an ability tells you to, and these abilities typically require you to expend a Mythic Point to gain their benefits.

## Mythic Points

The mythic power instilled in you gives you a pool of Mythic Points. Unlike most aspects of your character, which persist over the long term, Mythic Points last for only a single session. Mythic Points are required to cast mythic spells, use some mythic feats, activate mythic items, and can be required to attempt some mythic deeds (see below).

Each mythic character starts the session with 3 Mythic Points and can have a maximum of 3 Mythic Points at any time. If you have Mythic Points, you do _not_ gain Hero Points.

### Mythic Deeds

A mythic deed is a task, often in the form of a hazard or noncombat challenge, that restores an adventuring party's Mythic Points once successfully navigated. It's even possible that a party might uncover their Callings after completing their first mythic deed as non-mythic characters. A mythic deed should generally be at least a moderate challenge for a party of the characters' level or involve a combination of hard and very hard skill checks for the [[PF2e Journals/GM Screen/PCs' level|PCs' level]]; if the deed is easily accomplished without using mythic resources, it isn't a mythic deed.

Many mythic monsters have mythic deeds associated with them. These can serve as examples for creating your own mythic deeds as a GM and are often intended to allow players to interact with the monster at a level where fighting the creature would be unwise or unrewarding.

A mythic deed tied to a monster doesn't necessarily need to be presented at a different level than the monster it's associated with. For mythic monsters whose presence in a campaign is only intended to last a single session, it's likely that any associated mythic deeds will be no more than 2 levels higher than the monster and no more than 2 levels lower.

### Recovering Mythic Points

Mythic power is a rare and precious resource. While it accrues and recovers naturally within mythic characters over time, it can be difficult to accrue during the heat of combat. The following are ways a character might regain Mythic Points during a session.

*   **Slaying a mythic opponent** in combat restores 2 Mythic Points to the character whose attack, spell, or effect defeated the opponent, and 1 Mythic Point to all other mythic characters in the party.
*   **Completing a mythic deed** restores 3 Mythic Points to each mythic character in the party.
*   Following their Calling by taking actions particularly in line with the edicts (as determined by the GM) restores 1 Mythic Point to that character's mythic pool.
*   **A legendary accomplishment** or epic sacrifice can restore 1 or more Mythic Points for a character, even if it's not one of the more defined ways to recover Mythic Points. The GM gauges when this should occur. Mythic characters have more power over their own story than most and should be rewarded when the story is particularly compelling!
    

## Death and Dying as a Mythic Character

Mythic characters are much harder to kill than normal heroes. When a mythic character's dying value would reach an amount sufficient to kill them (usually 4), they instead increase their doomed value by 1 and stabilize at 0 Hit Points. A mythic character doesn't permanently die until their doomed value reaches 4. As normal, a mythic character's doomed value decreases by 1 each time they get a full night's rest.
