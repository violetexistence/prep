# Infiltration
## Obstacles in Play

On a character's turn, the character describes what they do to get past the obstacle. They then attempt any required check (or perform the required action, if their choice doesn't require a check). The result of the check determines how many Infiltration Points the character gains toward overcoming that obstacleâ€”or whether they instead raise suspicions and accrue Awareness Points!

**Critical Success** The PC gains 2 Infiltration Points.

**Success** The PC gains 1 Infiltration Point.

**Failure** The PCs accrue 1 Awareness Point.

**Critical Failure** The PCs accrue 2 Awareness Points.

If the character's actions automatically help without requiring a check, like using a spell, they usually gain 1 IP, but you can award 2 for particularly helpful actions.

## Preparation Activities

### [[Actions/Bribe Contact|Bribe Contact]]

**Cost** A bribe worth at least one-tenth of the Currency per Additional PC listed on Party Treasure by level. Doubling this amount grants a +2 circumstance bonus to the check.

**Requirements** You've successfully Gained a Contact.

* * *

You offer a bribe to your contact to help the heist in some way. Attempt a hard or very hard Deception or Diplomacy check.

**Success** The contact accepts the bribe and you gain 1 EP.

**Failure** You believe you successfully Bribed your Contact and gained 1 EP, but in fact the contact informs the opposition of the attempted bribery, adding 1 AP to the infiltration. The GM can reveal that this Edge Point grants no benefit at any point during the infiltration, as befits the story.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but adding 2 AP to the infiltration.

### [[Actions/Forge Documents|Forge Documents]]

You prepare forgeries that might serve as convincing props. Attempt a hard or very hard Society check.

* * *

**Success** You create convincing forgeries and gain 1 EP you can use only when presenting some form of paperwork.

**Failure** You create unconvincing documents. You gain 1 EP that (unknown to you) grants no benefit when used.

**Critical Failure** As a failure, but a PC who tries to use the Edge Point gets a critical failure, even if they use the Edge Point after rolling a failure.

### [[Actions/Gain Contact|Gain Contact]]

You try to make contact with an individual who can aid you in the infiltration. Attempt a normal, hard, or very hard DC Diplomacy or Society check, or a check using a Lore skill appropriate to your prospective contact.

**Failure** You fail to make contact.

**Critical Failure** You insult or spook the contact in some way. Future attempts take a -2 circumstance penalty.

**Special** Multiple critical failures might cause the contact to work against the PCs in some way, likely increasing the party's Awareness Points.

### [[Actions/Gossip|Gossip]]

You seek out rumors about the infiltration's target. Attempt a normal, hard, or very hard Diplomacy check.

* * *

**Success** You gain inside information about the place or group you're attempting to infiltrate that aids your planning.

**Failure** You learn nothing.
