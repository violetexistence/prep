# Light
  

| Levels of Light | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Bright Light | In bright light, such as sunlight, creatures and objects can be observed clearly by anyone with average vision or better. |
| Dim Light | Areas in shadow or lit by weak light sources are in dim light. Creatures and objects in dim light have the [[Conditions/Concealed\|Concealed]] condition, unless the seeker has darkvision or low-light vision, or a precise sense other than vision. |
| Darkness | A creature or object within darkness is [[Conditions/Hidden\|Hidden]] or undetected unless the seeker has darkvision or a precise sense other than vision. A creature without darkvision or another means of perceiving in darkness has the [[Conditions/Blinded\|Blinded]] condition while in darkness, though it might be able to see illuminated areas beyond the darkness. If a creature can see into an illuminated area, it can observe creatures within that illuminated area normally. After being in darkness, sudden exposure to bright light might make you [[Conditions/Dazzled\|Dazzled]] for a short time, as determined by the GM. |
