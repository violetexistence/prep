# Hero Points
Give out 1 Hero Point to each PC at the start of the session. Give out roughly 1 more per hour of play, for a heroic act or a moderate or major accomplishment. Hero Points can be spent in two ways.

  

| **Spend 1 Hero Point** to reroll a check and use the second result. This is a fortune effect. |
| --- |
| **Spend all your Hero Points** to avoid death when your dying condition would increase. Lose dying and stabilize with 0 HP. Don't gain or increase your wounded value from losing the dying condition in this way, but if you already had that condition you don't lose it. |
