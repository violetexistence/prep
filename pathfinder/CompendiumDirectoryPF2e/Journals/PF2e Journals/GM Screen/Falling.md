# Falling
When you fall more than 5 feet, take bludgeoning damage equal to half the distance you fell. If you take any damage, you land [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]. If you fall into water or a soft substance, calculate damage as though the fall were 20 feet shorter, 30 if you intentionally dove in (up to the depth of the substance).

### Falling on a Creature

If you land on a creature, that creature must attempt a `DC 15 Reflex check` save. Intentionally aiming yourself to land on a creature after a long fall is almost impossible.

**Critical Success** The creature takes no damage.

**Success** The creature takes bludgeoning damage equal to one-quarter the falling damage you took.

**Failure** The creature takes bludgeoning damage equal to half the falling damage you took.

**Critical Failure** The creature takes the same amount of bludgeoning damage you took from the fall.

### Falling Objects

A dropped object takes damage just like a falling creature. If the object lands on a creature, that creature can attempt a Reflex save using the same rules as for a creature falling on a creature. Hazards and spells that involve falling objects, such as a rock slide, have their own rules about how they interact with creatures and the damage they deal.
