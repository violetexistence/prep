### Liked

### Admired

### Revered

### Disliked

The PCs have a poor reputation among members of this group. Many members of the group know about the PCs, and are usually unfriendly to them. At this reputation, only moderate and major disservices reduce Reputation Points.

### Hated

The PCs have earned this group's ire. The vast majority of the group knows about the PCs and have an extremely unfavorable opinion toward them. Many members of the group are hostile toward the PCs, and those who aren't are unfriendly. When presented an easy opportunity to hurt the PCs, the group will jump at the chance. Only major disservices can still reduce Reputation Points.

Every member has heard of the PCs, is hostile toward them, and would take major risks to thwart or destroy them.
