# Detecting and Stealth with Other Senses
## Detecting with Other Senses

Most abilities that designate "a creature you can see" or the like function just as well if the user can precisely sense the subject with a different sense. If a monster uses a sense other than vision, the GM can adapt ways of avoiding detection that work with the monster's senses. For example, a creature that has echolocation might use hearing as a primary sense. This could mean its quarry is [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] in a noisy chamber, [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] in a great enough din, or [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]] under a silence spell.

## Using Stealth with Other Senses

The Stealth skill is designed to use Hide for avoiding visual detection and [[Actions/Avoid Notice|Avoid Notice]] and [[Actions/Sneak|Sneak]] to avoid being both seen and heard. For many special senses, a player can describe how they're avoiding detection by that special sense and use the most applicable Stealth action. For instance, a creature stepping lightly to avoid being detected via tremorsense would be using Sneak.

In some cases, rolling a Dexterity-based Stealth skill check to [[Actions/Sneak|Sneak]] doesn't make the most sense. For example, a PC trying to avoid being detected by a creature that senses heartbeats might meditate to slow their heart rate, using Wisdom instead of Dexterity for their Stealth check. When a creature could detect you using multiple different senses, use your lowest applicable attribute modifier.
