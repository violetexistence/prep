# Detecting Creatures
  

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| [[Conditions/Observed\|Observed]] | A creature you're observed by knows where you are and can target you normally. |
| [[Conditions/Concealed\|Concealed]] | A creature that you're [[Conditions/Concealed\|Concealed]] from must succeed at a `DC 5 Flat check` when targeting you with a non-area effect. |
| [[Conditions/Hidden\|Hidden]] | A creature you're [[Conditions/Hidden\|Hidden]] from knows the space you're in. It is [[Conditions/Off-Guard\|Off-Guard]] to you, and must succeed at a `DC 11 Flat check` to affect you. You can Hide to become hidden, and [[Actions/Seek\|Seek]] to find hidden creatures. |
| [[Conditions/Undetected\|Undetected]] | When you are undetected by a creature, it's [[Conditions/Off-Guard\|Off-Guard]] to you, can't see you, has no idea what space you occupy, and can't target you. It can try to guess your square by picking a square and attempting an attack. This works like targeting a [[Conditions/Hidden\|Hidden]] creature, but the flat check and attack roll are rolled in secret by the GM. |
| [[Conditions/Unnoticed\|Unnoticed]] | A creature you're unnoticed by is unaware of your presence. |
| [[Conditions/Invisible\|Invisible]] | You're undetected by everyone. You can't become observed while [[Conditions/Invisible\|Invisible]] except via special abilities or magic. |
