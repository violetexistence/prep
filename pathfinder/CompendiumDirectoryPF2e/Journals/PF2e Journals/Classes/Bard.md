# Bard
_You are a master of artistry, a scholar of hidden secrets, and a captivating persuader. Using powerful performances, you influence minds and elevate souls to new levels of heroics. You might use your powers to become a charismatic leader, or perhaps you might instead be a counselor, manipulator, scholar, scoundrel, or virtuoso. While your versatility leads some to consider you a beguiling ne'er-do-well and a jack-of-all-trades, it's dangerous to dismiss you as a master of none._

**Key Attribute: CHARISMA**

At 1st level, your class gives you an attribute boost to Charisma.

**Hit Points: 8 plus your Constitution modifier**

You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.

# Roleplaying the Bard

## During Combat Encounters...

You use magical performances to alter the odds in favor of your allies. You confidently alternate between attacks, healing, and helpful spells as needed.

## During Social Encounters...

You persuade, prevaricate, and threaten with ease.

## While Exploring...

You're a font of knowledge, folktales, legends, and lore that provide a deeper context and helpful reconnaissance for the group's adventure. Your spells and performances inspire your allies to greater discovery and success.

## In Downtime...

You can earn money and prestige with your performances, gaining a name for yourself and acquiring patrons. Eventually, tales of your talents and triumphs might attract other bards to study your techniques in a bardic college.

## You Might...

*   Have a passion for your art so strong that you forge a spiritual connection with it.
*   Take point when tact and nonviolent solutions are required.
*   Follow your muse, whether it's a mysterious fey creature, a philosophical concept, a psychic force, or a deity of art or music, and with its aid learn secret lore that few others have.

## Others Probably...

*   Relish the opportunity to invite you to social events, either as a performer or a guest, but consider you to be something of a curiosity in their social circles.
*   Underestimate you compared to other spellcasters, believing you are little more than a foppish minstrel and overlooking the subtle power of your magic.
*   Respond favorably to your social charm and abilities, but remain suspicious of your beguiling magic.

## Ancestry and Background

In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.

## Composition Spells

You can infuse your performances with magic to create unique effects called compositions. Compositions are a special type of spell that often require you to use the Performance skill when casting them. Composition spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to perform, write a new composition, or otherwise engage your muse.

Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points. You learn the [[Spells/Counter Performance|Counter Performance]] composition spell, protecting against auditory and visual effects.

## Composition Cantrips

Composition cantrips are special composition spells that don't cost Focus Points, so you can use them as often as you like. Composition cantrips are in addition to the cantrips you choose with bard spellcasting. Unlike other cantrips, you can't swap out composition cantrips gained from bard feats at a later level, unless you swap out the specific feat via retraining.

You learn the [[Spells/Courageous Anthem|Courageous Anthem]] composition cantrip, which boosts your allies' attacks, damage, and defense against fear.

## Initial Proficiencies

At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.

## Muses

As a bard, you select one muse at 1st level. This muse leads you to great things, and might be a physical creature, a deity, a philosophy, or a captivating mystery.

Muses can be found here: [[Class Features/Maestro|Maestro]], [[Class Features/Polymath|Polymath]], [[Class Features/Enigma|Enigma]], and [[Class Features/Warrior|Warrior]].

## Bard Spellcasting

You draw upon magic from esoteric knowledge. You are a spellcaster and can cast spells of the occult tradition using the Cast a Spell activity.

As a bard, when you cast spells, your incantations might be musical riffs or clever limericks, your gestures might incorporate dance and dramatic pantomiming, and you might accompany your spellcasting by playing a musical instrument.

Each day, you can cast up to two 1st-rank spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.

As you increase in level as a bard, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest rank of spells you can cast.

Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Charisma, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier.

  

| Your Level | Cantrips | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th | 5th | 6th | 7th | 8th | 9th | 10th |

| \* The magnum opus class feature gives you a 10th-rank spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

## Spell Repertoire

The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-rank occult spells of your choice and five occult cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the occult list or from other occult spells to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell rank.

You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see the Bard Spells per Day table), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same rank. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-rank spell; at 3rd level, you select two 2nd-rank spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-rank version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell.

Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.

### **Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire**

As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same rank. This spell can be a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.

## Bard Feats Level 2

At 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you gain a bard class feat.

## Skill Feats Level 2

At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.

## General Feats Level 3

At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.

## Reflex Expertise Level 3

You've developed a knack for dodging danger. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.

**Guardian** Even in the heaviest of armors, you can brace yourself against widespread effects. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.

## Signature Spells Level 3

Experience allows you to cast some spells more flexibly. For each spell rank you have access to, choose one spell of that rank to be a signature spell. You don't need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you've learned a signature spell at a higher rank than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-rank versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell rank at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that rank without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.

## Skill Increases Level 3

At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in or become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained.

At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.

## Attribute Boosts Level 5

In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers.

At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.

## Ancestry Feats Level 5

In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.

## Expert Spellcaster Level 7

Your magical techniques grow stronger. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifiers and spell DCs increase to expert.

## Fortitude Expertise Level 9

Your physique has grown hardy in your adventures. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.

## Performer's Heart Level 9

The greatest performances require an understanding of your own mind and flawless concentration. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.

## Bard Weapon Expertise Level 11

You have become thoroughly adept with bardic weapons. Your proficiency rank for martial weapons, simple weapons, and unarmed attacks increases to expert. When you critically succeed at an attack roll using one of these weapons or an unarmed attack while one of your compositions is active, you apply the critical specialization effect for that weapon or unarmed attack.

## Perception Mastery Level 11

You've developed keen awareness and attention to detail. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.

## Light Armor Expertise Level 13

You've learned how to dodge while wearing light or no armor. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense increase to expert.

## Weapon Specialization Level 13

You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal an additional 2 damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.

## Master Spellcaster Level 15

You pluck the threads of magic like the strings of a harp. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifiers and spell DCs increase to master.

## Greater Performer's Heart Level 17

Your performances warp the mind and cause emotions to flower, and understanding how to do this also forges an incomparable understanding of your own mind. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to legendary. When you roll a critical failure on a Will save, you get a failure instead. When you fail a Will save against an effect that deals damage, you take half damage.

## Legendary Spellcaster Level 19

Your command of magic is the stuff of legends. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifiers and spell DCs increase to legendary.

## Magnum Opus Level 19

You have tuned your spellcasting to the highest caliber. Add two common 10th-rank occult spells to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-rank spell slot you can use to cast these spells using bard spellcasting. Unlike other spell slots, you can't use 10th-rank slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots. You don't gain more 10th-rank spells as you level up, but you can take the Perfect Encore feat to gain a second slot.
