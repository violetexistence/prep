# Exemplar
_As the war god died, his power rained through the many planes of creation, sparking conflict and instilling divine energy in those previously without it. Whether you were directly touched by this power, claimed it from an ancient being or artifact, or whether it awoke something long dormant in your lineage, a spark of the divine now blazes within your soul, granting you abilities, sacred weapons, and divine signifiers that reach into the realm previously reserved for gods and legends. How you wield these tools and grow your power is for you to decide—you may become a hero or you may turn to selfish ends, but one thing is certain: you intend to carve your epithet in history, immortalized in the memory of gods and mortals alike._

**Key Attribute: STRENGTH or DEXTERITY**

At 1st level, your class gives you an attribute boost to Wisdom.

**Hit Points: 10 plus your Constitution modifier**

You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.

# Roleplaying the Exemplar

## During Combat Encounters...

You fight on the vanguard, scattering lesser foes to the winds. You concentrate your divine energy into the right weapon or tool for the moment. When an arrow strikes your skin, it stings no more than a flea; when your spear strikes forward, it can pierce gods.

## During Social Encounters...

You naturally cut a larger-than-life figure. You may use your personal magnetism to inspire others, or you might be a lone and brooding figure who seldom speaks. Either way, your actions and words hang in the air with weight.

## While Exploring...

You feel for the flow of fate, knowing that your path will bring you to your next quest. You may take special interest in certain aspects of nature, society, or the cosmos as your divine spark begins to find itself drawn to certain powers.

## In Downtime...

Inactivity rarely suits an exemplar, so you seek out additional deeds or quests to spread your name. You might search for creatures to slay, compete in athletic contests, or quest for lost artifacts.

## You Might...

*   Chase glory across the land, beyond the sea, and over the horizon.
*   Take other heroes under your wing, that your legend may live on through them.
*   Feel the weight of immense expectations and obligation.

## Others Probably...

*   Look to you in times of crisis, thinking you can handle any challenge.
*   Think of you as larger than life, more of the figure of a story than a living adventurer.
*   Mistake your heroism and capability for pride and aloofness.

## Ancestry and Background

In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.

## Attribute Boosts

In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers.

At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.

## Initial Proficiencies

At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.

## Divine Spark and Ikons

Within your soul is a tiny spark of divine power that belongs not to a deity, but is something you've claimed all your own. You can focus this divine power through special items known as ikons. Ikons are items or bodily features intrinsically linked to you—sacred vessels forged from your divinity that are capable of conducting its power.

By placing your divine spark into one of your ikons, you empower that ikon to accomplish deeds beyond what it could in mortal hands. Each ikon has both a passive immanence effect and an active transcendence effect. Both of these effects require your divine spark to be in the item. You can place your spark into an ikon by using the [[Actions/Shift Immanence|Shift Immanence]] action.

### Spark Transcendence

While your spark dwells within an ikon, you get that ikon's immanence effect continually. However, you can also Spark Transcendence in a mighty deed, channeling your divinity through the ikon—though when you Spark Transcendence, the force of the act temporarily casts your divine spark out of the ikon. Each ikon's transcendence action appears in its stat block, and the transcendence trait is described in the Key Terms sidebar.

### Expanding **Immanence** And Transcendence

Each ikon has one immanence and one transcendence ability when acquired, but you can imbue your ikons with additional abilities through higher-level exemplar class features and feats. These abilities have the ikon trait.

## Ikons

As an exemplar, you select three ikons at first level. Typically, you will want to ensure at least one of your ikons is a weapon. Body ikons accentuate a physical trait of your body and so can't be stolen, disarmed, dispelled, or otherwise taken away. Weapon and worn ikons are tied to items of power. When you select one, you gain a non-magical, level-0 item of your choice that matches its usage entry. Providence ensures you come across these items; you might be traveling along a path to find a spear in a tree that only you can dislodge, or you might awaken holding a gleaming sash you saw in your dreams.

Your ikons can be etched with runes, upgraded, or otherwise modified as normal for items of their type. A body or worn ikon can have runes etched on it to apply to your unarmed attacks as though it were handwraps of mighty blows, though only one of your ikons can have these runes and no ikon can have both these and armor or weapon runes.

If you acquire a new item the ikon's usage could apply to, you can switch your ikon to the new item by spending 1 day of downtime with the new ikon as you saturate the object with your divine energy. You can use this process to make an existing magic item, like a cloak of illusions or a searing blade, into your ikon. If the item wasn't already a divine item, it becomes one for as long as it is your ikon, removing the arcane, occult, primal, or magical trait from the item and adding the divine trait. Artifacts, intelligent items, and other similarly powerful objects might resist your attempts to exert your divinity over them, with unpredictable results determined by the GM.

## Exemplar Feats

At 1st level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain an exemplar class feat.

## Humble Strikes

Even the most unassuming weapons can accomplish great deeds. When you are wielding a simple weapon, increase the damage die size of that weapon by one step.

## Shield Block

You gain the [[Feats/Shield Block|Shield Block]] general feat, a reaction that lets you reduce damage with your shield.

## Skill Feats Level 2

At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.

## General Feats Level 3

At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.

## Root Epithet Level 3

As your story unfolds, your personality and deeds begin to shape the potential of your divine spark. You come to bear an epithet—a word or phrase that seems to always stick in the mind of those describing you. (You can find examples of acquiring epithets in the Earning your Name sidebar on page 35.) Your epithets grant you additional abilities, especially when your divine spark is brought to the surface.

You first gain a root epithet to describe an aspect of your personality. This grants you a skill, as well as a special effect that occurs when you Spark Transcendence. If you are already trained in the granted skill, you become trained in a different skill of your choice, as normal. An effect that occurs after you Spark Transcendence happens immediately after your transcendence action is completely resolved.

## Skill Increases Level 3

At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained.

At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.

## Ancestry Feats Level 5

In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.

## Weapon Expertise Level 5

You've dedicated yourself to learning the intricacies of your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for unarmed attacks, simple weapons, and martial weapons increase to expert.

## Dominion Epithet Level 7

Your divinity has grown in power along with your deeds, allowing you to begin claiming dominion over aspects of creation. Choose one of the following epithets. Each one grants a critical specialization ability you can use instead of any others you might have access to, and an ability you can use when you Spark Transcendence. You can benefit from no more than one epithet ability each time you Spark Transcendence. Some epithets grant additional benefits, such as feats.

## Spirit Striking Level 7

Your divine power can't be contained, escaping in flits and embers as you wreak violence. You deal 2 additional spirit damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.

## Unassailable Soul Level 7

A firm knowledge of (or foolish pride in) yourself and your ability girds your mind against doubt and intrusion. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.

## Divine Premonition Level 9

A sense of the flow of fate allows you to respond to danger with uncanny alacrity. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.

## Godly Expertise Level 9

Your divine power increases in might. Your proficiency rank for your exemplar class DC increases to expert.

## Perception Expertise Level 9

You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.

## Divine Weapon Mastery Level 13

Your skill with weapons is divinely inspired. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increase to master.

## Greater Unassailable Soul Level 13

A wall of confidence blunts every arrow seeking to pierce your mind. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to legendary. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success. When you roll a critical failure at a Will save, you get a failure instead. When you fail a Will save against a damaging effect, you take half damage.

## Burnished Armor Expertise Level 13

Exposure to your divine spark has reinforced your armor. Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium armor, and unarmored defense increase to expert.

## Greater Spirit Striking Level 15

Your additional damage from spirit striking increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.

## Mortality Reforged Level 15

Inner fire has burned away the frailty of a mortal body. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.

## Sovereignty Epithet Level 15

The litany of heroic deeds left in your wake has caused your divine spark to blaze bright enough that it now illuminates your legacy. Choose one of the following epithets, which grants you an ability you can use when you Spark Transcendence. You can benefit from no more than one epithet ability each time you Spark Transcendence.

## Deific Mastery Level 17

You have achieved full mastery over your divine spark as its power flows through your body and ikons. Your proficiency rank for your exemplar class DC increases to master.

## Perception Mastery Level 17

Through your adventures, you've developed keen awareness and attention to detail, the better to watch over your wards and keep an eye out for monsters and other threats. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.

## Burnished Armor Mastery Level 19

Your armor shines with divine light, flawless and unyielding. Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium armor, and unarmored defense increase to master.
