# Rogue
_You are skilled and opportunistic. Using your sharp wits and quick reactions, you take advantage of your opponents' missteps and strike where it hurts most. You play a dangerous game, seeking thrills and testing your skills, and likely don't care much for any laws that happen to get in your way. While the path of every rogue is unique and riddled with danger, the one thing you all share in common is the breadth and depth of your skills._

**Key Attribute: DEXTERITY OR OTHER**

At 1st level, your class gives you an attribute boost to Dexterity or an option from rogue's racket.

**Hit Points: 8 plus your Constitution modifier**

You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.

# Roleplaying the Rogue

## During Combat Encounters...

You move about stealthily so you can catch foes unawares. You're a precision instrument, more useful against a tough boss or distant spellcaster than against rank-and-file soldiers.

## During Social Encounters...

Your skills give you multiple tools to influence your opposition. Pulling cons and ferreting out information are second nature to you.

## While Exploring...

You sneak to get the drop on foes and scout for danger or traps. You're a great asset, since you can disable traps, solve puzzles, and anticipate dangers.

## In Downtime...

You might pick pockets or trade in illegal goods. You can also become part of a thieves' guild, or even found one of your own.

## You Might...

*   Hone your skills through intense practice, both on your own and out in the world.
*   Know where to attain illicit goods.
*   Skirt or break the law because you think it's meaningless or have your own code.

## Others Probably...

*   Find you charming or fascinating, even if they think they know better than to trust you.
*   Come to you when they need someone who is willing to take risks or use questionable methods.
*   Suspect you're motivated primarily by greed.

## Ancestry and Background

In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.

## Initial Proficiencies

At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.

## Rogue Feats

At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain a rogue class feat.

## Rogue's Racket

You've begun to develop your techniques and approach to a job, while building your reputation in rogues' circles. Choose a rogue's racket from the list below.

[[Class Features/Eldritch Trickster|Eldritch Trickster]]

[[Class Features/Mastermind|Mastermind]]

[[Class Features/Ruffian|Ruffian]]

[[Class Features/Scoundrel|Scoundrel]]

[[Class Features/Thief|Thief]]

## Skill Feats

You gain skill feats more often than others. At 1st level and every level thereafter, you gain a skill feat.

## Sneak Attack

When your enemy can't properly defend itself, you take advantage to deal extra damage. If you Strike a creature that has the [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] condition with an agile or finesse melee weapon, an agile or finesse unarmed attack, a ranged weapon attack, or a ranged unarmed attack, you deal an extra 1d6 precision damage. For a ranged attack with a thrown melee weapon, that weapon must also be agile or finesse.

As your level increases, so does the number of damage dice for your sneak attack. Increase the number of dice by one at 5th, 11th, and 17th levels.

## Surprise Attack

You act before foes can react. On the first round of combat, if you roll Deception or Stealth for initiative, creatures that haven't acted are [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] to you.

## Skill Increases Level 2

You gain more skill increases than members of other classes. At 2nd level and every level thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained.

At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.

## Deny Advantage Level 3

As someone who takes advantage of openings, you are careful not to leave such gaps yourself. You aren't [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] to [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]], [[Conditions/Undetected|Undetected]], or flanking creatures of your level or lower, or creatures of your level or lower using surprise attack. However, they can still help their allies flank.

## General Feats Level 3

At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.

## Attribute Boosts Level 5

In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers.

At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost, and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.

## Ancestry Feats Level 5

In addition to the initial ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.

## Weapon Tricks Level 5

You gain expert proficiency in simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks. When you critically succeed at an attack roll against an [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] creature while using an agile or finesse weapon or an agile or finesse unarmed attack, you apply the critical specialization effect for that weapon or unarmed attack.

## Evasive Reflexes Level 7

You've learned to move quickly to avoid explosions, dragons' breath, and worse. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Reflex save, you get a critical success instead.

## Perception Mastery Level 7

You've developed keen awareness and attention to detail. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.

## Weapon Specialization Level 7

You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal an additional 2 damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.

## Debilitating Strikes Level 9

When taking advantage of an opening, you both hinder and harm your foe. You gain the Debilitating Strike free action.

### [[Actions/Debilitating Strike|Debilitating Strike]] `pf2:0`

**Trigger** Your Strike hits an off-guard creature and deals damage

* * *

You apply one of the following debilitations, which lasts until the end of your next turn:

*   **Debilitation** The target takes a -10-foot status penalty to its Speeds.
*   **Debilitation** The target becomes [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]].

## Rogue Resilience Level 9

## Rogue Expertise Level 11

Your techniques are now harder to resist. Your proficiency rank for your rogue class DC increases to expert.

## Greater Rogue Reflexes Level 13

You elude danger to a degree that few can match. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to legendary. When you roll a critical failure on a Reflex save, you get a failure instead. When you roll a failure on a Reflex save against a damaging effect, you take half damage.

You've mastered a rogue's fighting moves. Your proficiency ranks increase to master for all simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks.

## Double Debilitation Level 15

Your opportunistic attacks are particularly detrimental. When you use [[Actions/Debilitating Strike|Debilitating Strike]], you can apply two debilitations simultaneously; removing one removes both.

## Greater Weapon Specialization Level 15

Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.

## Agile Mind Level 17

You play mental games and employ cognitive tricks to throw off mind-altering effects. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.

## Light Armor Mastery Level 19

Your skill with light armor improves, increasing your ability to dodge blows. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense increase to master.

## Master Strike Level 19
