# Sorcerer
_You didn't choose to become a spellcaster-you were born one. There's magic in your blood, whether a divinity touched one of your ancestors, a forebear communed with a primal creature, or a powerful occult ritual influenced your line. Self-reflection and study allow you to refine your inherent magical skills and unlock new, more powerful abilities. The power in your blood carries a risk, however, and you constantly face the choice of whether you'll rise to become a master spellcaster or fall into destruction._

**Key Attribute: CHARISMA**

At 1st level, your class gives you an attribute boost to Charisma.

**Hit Points: 6 plus your Constitution modifier**

You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.

# Roleplaying the Sorcerer

## During Combat Encounters...

You use spells to injure your enemies, influence their minds, and hamper their movements. You might be too vulnerable to get into melee combat, or your bloodline might give you abilities that help you hold your own in a brawl. While your magic is powerful, to conserve your best spells-or when you've used them all up-you also rely on cantrips.

## During Social Encounters...

Your natural charisma makes you good at interacting with people.

## While Exploring...

You detect the magic around you, finding treasures and warning your adventuring group of magical traps. When the group encounters mysteries or problems related to your bloodline, you try to solve them.

## In Downtime...

You craft magic items or scribe scrolls. Your bloodline might drive you to research your ancestry or associate with affiliated people or creatures.

## You Might...

*   Have a strong independent streak, and whether you embrace or reject your magical heritage, you long to distinguish yourself both as a spellcaster and as an individual.
*   View your lineage with fascination, fear, or something in between-anything from wholehearted acceptance to vehement rejection.
*   Rely on magic items, such as scrolls and wands, to supplement your limited selection of spells.

## Others Probably...

*   Marvel at your ability to create magic from thin air and view your abilities with equal parts admiration and mistrust.
*   Consider you less dedicated than studious wizards, devoted clerics, and other practitioners of magic, since power comes to you naturally.
*   Assume you're as unpredictable as the magic you bring forth, even if your personality proves otherwise.

At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.

## Initial Proficiencies

At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training, noted at the start of this class.

## Bloodline

Choose a bloodline that gives you your spellcasting talent. This choice determines the type of spells you cast and the spell list you choose them from, additional spells you learn, and additional trained skills. You also gain Focus Points and special focus spells based on your bloodline. The bloodlines presented are as follows:

*   **[[Class Features/Bloodline_ Aberrant|Aberrant]]** A strange and unknowable influence gives you occult spells.
*   **[[Class Features/Bloodline_ Angelic|Angelic]]** Holy grace bestows divine spells upon you.
*   **[[Class Features/Bloodline_ Demonic|Demonic]]** A sinful corruption gives you divine spells.
*   **[[Class Features/Bloodline_ Diabolic|Diabolic]]** A bond with devils gives you divine spells.
*   **[[Class Features/Bloodline_ Draconic|Draconic]]** The blood of dragons grants you arcane spells.
*   **[[Class Features/Bloodline_ Elemental|Elemental]]** The power of the elements manifests in you as primal spells.
*   **[[Class Features/Bloodline_ Fey|Fey]]** Influence from the fey gives you primal spells.
*   **[[Class Features/Bloodline_ Genie|Genie]]** Through lineage, magic, or wishes made real, the blood of a noble genie flows through your veins.
*   **[[Class Features/Bloodline_ Hag|Hag]]** The blight of a hag has given you occult spells.
*   **[[Class Features/Bloodline_ Harrow|Harrow]]** You have a deep connection to the harrow.
*   **[[Class Features/Bloodline_ Imperial|Imperial]]** An ancient power grants you arcane spells.
*   **[[Class Features/Bloodline_ Nymph|Nymph]]** One of your ancestors was inspired by a nymph, or perhaps was a nymph themself, and now the beauty of nature lives in you.
*   **[[Class Features/Bloodline_ Phoenix|Phoenix]]** The healing fire a phoenix's blessing grants you primal spells.
*   **[[Class Features/Bloodline_ Psychopomp|Psychopomp]]** For good or ill, your ancestors' deeds drew the attention of psychopomps, or you might somehow count one in your family tree. The presence of these shepherds of souls and enemies of undeath has left an indelible mark on you.
*   **[[Class Features/Bloodline_ Shadow|Shadow]]** Whether due to a velstrac's manipulations or a planar jaunt gone horribly wrong, your bloodline was infused with a vein of shadow.
*   **[[Class Features/Bloodline_ Undead|Undead]]** The touch of death gives you divine spells.
*   **[[Class Features/Bloodline_ Wyrmblessed|Wyrmblessed]]** A draconic blessing grants you divine spells.

## Sorcerer Spellcasting

Your bloodline provides you with incredible magical power. You are a spellcaster and can cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity. The tradition from which your spells come is determined by your bloodline. As a sorcerer, you draw your power from within, and the gestures and incantations you use to shape your power might evoke the nature of your bloodline. For instance, a sorcerer with a demonic bloodline might chant guttural fiendish phrases or make brief curt gestures to cast a spell.

Each day, you can cast up to three 1st-rank spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.

As you increase in level as a sorcerer, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest rank of spells you can cast, as shown on the Sorcerer Spells per Day table.

Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Charisma, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Charisma modifier.

### Heightening Spells

When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the rank you want to cast it in order to heighten it to that rank. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.

### Cantrips

Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of sorcerer spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.

  

| Your Level | Cantrips | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th | 5th | 6th | 7th | 8th | 9th | 10th |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| \* The bloodline paragon class feature gives you a 10th-rank spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

## Spell Repertoire

The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-rank spells of your choice and four cantrips of your choice, as well as an additional spell and cantrip from your bloodline. You choose these from the common spells from the tradition corresponding to your bloodline, or from other spells from that tradition to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell rank.

You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see the Sorcerer Spells per Day table), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same rank. When you gain a new rank of spells, your first new spell is always the sorcerous gift spell for that rank that's listed in your bloodline, but you can choose the other spells. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-rank spell; at 3rd level, you gain a new spell from your bloodline and two other 2nd-rank spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might select a higher-rank version of a spell you already know so that you can cast a heightened version of that spell.

Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot or vice versa.

### Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire

As you gain new spells in your spell repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same rank. This spell can be a cantrip, but you can't swap out bloodline spells. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.

## Bloodline Spells

Your bloodline grants you bloodline spells, special spells unique to your lineage. Bloodline spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity. Unlike other characters, you don't need to do anything specific to Refocus, as the power flowing through your veins naturally replenishes your focus pool.

Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots; you can't cast them using spell slots. The maximum Focus Points your focus pool can hold is equal to the number of focus spells you have, but can never be more than 3 points. You learn the initial bloodline spell, which is unique to your bloodline.

### Reading a Bloodline Entry

A bloodline entry contains the following information.

**Tradition** You use this magical tradition and spell list

**Bloodline Skills** You become trained in the listed skills.

**Sorcerous Gifts** You automatically add the spells listed here to your spell repertoire, as described in the Spell Repertoire feature. At 1st level, you gain a cantrip and a 1st-rank spell. You learn the other spells on the list as soon as you gain the ability to cast sorcerer spells of that rank.

**Bloodline Spells** You automatically gain the initial bloodline spell at 1st level and can gain more by selecting the Advanced Bloodline and Greater Bloodline feats.

**Blood Magic** Whenever you cast a bloodline spell using a Focus Point or a sorcerous gift spell using a spell slot, you choose one blood magic effect you know to benefit from. You begin play with the benefit listed in your bloodline and can gain others through sorcerer feats.

If the blood magic effect offers a choice, make it before resolving the spell. The blood magic effect occurs after resolving any checks for the spell's initial effects and, against a foe, applies only if the spell is a successful attack or the foe fails its saving throw. If the spell has an area, you must designate yourself or one target in the area when you cast the spell to be the target of the blood magic effect. All references to spell rank refer to the rank of the spell you cast.

## Sorcerous Potency

Because of the magical power inherent in your blood, your spells that hurt or cure are stronger than those of other spellcasters. When you Cast a Spell from your spell slots that either deals damage or restores Hit Points, you gain a status bonus to that spell's damage or healing equal to the spell's rank. This applies only to the initial damage or healing the spell deals when cast. An individual creature takes this damage or benefits from this healing only once per spell, even if the spell would damage or heal that creature multiple times.

## Skill Feats Level 2

At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.

## Sorcerer FeatsLevel 2

At 2nd level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a sorcerer class feat.

## General Feats Level 3

At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.

## Signature Spells Level 3

Your innate power allows you to cast some of your spells more flexibly. For each spell rank you have access to, choose one spell of that rank to be a signature spell. You don't need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you've learned a signature spell at a higher rank than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-rank versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell rank at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that rank without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.

## Skill Increases Level 3

At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use an increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.

At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.

## Ancestry Feats Level 5

In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.

## Magical Fortitude Level 5

Magical power has improved your body's resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.

## Expert Spellcaster Level 7

Your inherent magic responds easily and powerfully to your command. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC for spells of your bloodline's tradition increase to expert.

## Reflex Expertise Level 9

Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.

## Perception Expertise Level 11

You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.

## Weapon Expertise Level 11

You've improved your combat skill. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increase to expert.

## Defensive Robes Level 13

The flow of magic and your defensive training combine to help you get out of the way before an attack. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.

## Weapon Specialization Level 13

You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal an additional 2 damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.

## Master Spellcaster Level 15

You have achieved mastery over the magic in your blood. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC for spells of your bloodline's tradition increase to master.

## Majestic WillLevel 17

Your mind and will are tempered by your mastery of magical forces. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.

## Bloodline Paragon Level 19

You have perfected the magic in your bloodline. Add two common 10th-rank spells of your tradition to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-rank spell slot you can use to cast these spells, using sorcerer spellcasting. Unlike other spell slots, you don't gain more 10th-rank spells as you level up, and they can't be used for abilities that let you cast spells without expending spell slots or abilities that give you more spell slots. You can take the [[Feats/Bloodline Perfection|Bloodline Perfection]] sorcerer feat to gain a second slot.

## Legendary Spellcaster Level 19

You demonstrate prodigious talent for spellcasting. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC for spells of your bloodline's tradition increase to legendary.
