# Commander
_You approach battle with the knowledge that tactics and strategy are every bit as crucial as brute strength or numbers. You might have trained in classical theories of warfare and strategy at a military academy, or you might have refined your techniques through hard-won experience as part of an army or mercenary company. Regardless of how you came by your knowledge, you have a gift for signaling your allies from across the battlefield and deploying commands to rout even the most desperate conflicts, empowering your squad to exceed their limits and claim victory._

**Key Attribute: INTELLIGENCE**

At 1st level, your class gives you an attribute boost to Intelligence

**Hit Points: 8 plus your Constitution modifier**

You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.

# Roleplaying the Commander

## During Combat Encounters...

You look for an advantageous position to survey the battlefield, shouting out instructions to your allies or signaling them with your personal banner based on the tactics you’ve trained and drilled beforehand.

## During Social Encounters...

You leverage your keen intellect and knowledge of warfare to watch for hostile political ploys and ferret out information your rivals would rather keep hidden.

## While Exploring...

You use your keen perception, trained across multiple battlefields, to watch for ambushes and plan tactics that are useful for your current environment.

## In Downtime...

You make connections with soldiers and aristocrats alike, leveraging your connections to find promising prospects for work. You might enjoy board games like chess, draj, go, imperial conquest, or other games of tactics as ways to keep yourself sharp in times of peace.

## You Might...

*   Take the lead in discussions or negotiations instinctively, trusting your keen mind to prevail and turn negotiations to your advantage.
*   Constantly strive to learn more about your allies so you can bring out the best in them.
*   Hold yourself to an incredibly high standard of personal responsibility, chastising yourself for small mistakes that others don’t even notice.

## Others Probably...

*   Respect your knowledge and opinion, especially when taking the broad view of a situation.
*   Sometimes consider you to be too bossy or demanding.
*   Underestimate your cunning, especially if they’re a scholar or other academic unfamiliar with the rigorous study required to obtain your tactical knowledge.

## Commander's Banner

A commander needs a battle standard to help guide their allies on the field. You start play with a custom banner that you can use to signal allies when using tactics (see below) or to deploy specific abilities. Your banner can be affixed to a weapon or shield you are wielding, attached to a simple pole or handle and held in one hand, or worn affixed to a pole alongside your backpack. Your banner might be a literal flag or pennant, a decorated fan, a personalized totem, or some other highly visible and item of negligible or light Bulk. Your banner requires customization and influences your allies' morale, so you can have only one banner at a time designated as your commander's banner; designating a new banner or standard as your commander's banner takes 1 minute.

As long as your banner is visible and in your possession, it provides an aura that gives you and all allies in a 30-foot emanation a +1 status bonus to Will saves and DCs against fear effects. You can pause or resume this effect as part of any action you would typically use to stow or retrieve your banner. If your banner is destroyed or stolen, allies currently benefiting from its bonuses become [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]]. This effect has the aura, emotion, mental, and visual traits.

Some abilities allow you to place your banner in a specialized manner, such as the Commander's Companion and Plant Banner feats. As long as you have placed your banner in this way, any banner abilities originate from your banner's space instead of your own, and you gain the same basic benefits as when it is in your possession. An unattended banner has the base Hardness and Hit Points of a standard item of its type (usually cloth, thin leather, or thin wood) or the Hardness and Hit Points of the object it is affixed to, whichever is greater.

## Tactics

By studying and practicing the strategic arts of war, you can guide your allies to victory. You begin play with a folio containing five tactics. These are combat techniques and coordinated maneuvers you can instruct your allies in, enabling them to respond to your signals in combat. As you increase in level, you gain the ability to learn more potent tactics. When you gain the [[Class Features/Expert Tactician|Expert Tactician]] class feature, you gain the ability to add expert tactics to your folio; when you gain the [[Class Features/Master Tactician|Master Tactician]] class feature, you can add master tactics to your folio; and when you gain the [[Class Features/Legendary Tactician|Legendary Tactician]] class feature, you can add legendary tactics to your folio.

## Preparing and Changing Tactics

Each day during your daily preparations, you prepare three tactics from your folio and drill in them alongside your allies, enabling you to use these tactics until your next daily preparations. When you drill, you can instruct a total number of allies equal to 2 + your Intelligence modifier, enabling these allies to respond to your tactics in combat. These allies are your squadmates. A squadmate always has the option not to respond to your tactical signal if they do not wish to. You count as one of your squadmates for the purposes of participating in or benefiting from a tactic (though you do not count against your own maximum number of squadmates). The tactics trait is explained in more detail in the key terms sidebar on this page.

You can change which tactics you have prepared from those in your folio by spending 10 minutes to drill, replacing all previously prepared tactics and squadmates. This does not prevent your allies from performing their own activities during this time frame. Some tactics have a limited usage, such as the Valkyrie's Charge tactic, which can be used once per day. These tactics can never exceed their indicated use limit even if you replace them with a different tactic and then prepare them again later that same day, but you can replace a tactic whose limited use has been expended with another tactic you know any time you are able to change your prepared tactics.

## Gaining New Tactics

You add additional tactics to your folio and increase the number of tactics you can prepare when you gain the expert tactician, master tactician, and legendary tactician class features. You can also add tactics to your folio with the Tactical Expansion feat, though this does not change the number you can have prepared. Because tactics folios use shorthand and signals unique to each commander, there is typically no benefit to using (or stealing) another commander's folio, though you can train with another commander to retrain one tactic in your folio to another that they know.

## Drilled Reactions

Your time spent training your allies allows them to respond quickly and instinctively to your commands. Once per round when you use a tactic, you can grant one ally of your choice benefiting from that tactic an extra reaction. This reaction has to be used for that tactic and is lost if not used.

## Shield Block

You gain the [[Feats/Shield Block|Shield Block]] general feat, a reaction that lets you reduce damage with your shield.

## Commander Feats

At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain a commander class feat.

## Skill Feats Level 2

At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. Skill feats have the skill trait. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.

## General Feats Level 3

At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.

## Skill Increases Level 3

At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in or become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained.

At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.

## Warfare Expertise Level 3

Your knowledge of war and strategy grows and guides your decisions in battle. You gain expert proficiency in Warfare Lore. You can use Warfare Lore to [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] about most creatures regardless of type, but typically only to determine whether they can be reasoned with, their most notable offensive abilities, and whether one of their saving throws is particularly weak. In addition, as long as you are observing at least one opponent when initiative is rolled, you can use Warfare Lore for your initiative roll.

## Ancestry FeatsLevel 5

## Military ExpertiseLevel 5

You've studied in a wide variety of weapons and learned to apply their principles in combat. Your proficiency rank for martial weapons, simple weapons, and unarmed attacks increases to expert. When you critically succeed at an attack roll with a weapon you are at least an expert with, you apply the weapon's critical specialization effect.

## Expert TacticianLevel 7

Your time spent leading and training others on battlefield tactics has improved your combat acumen. Your proficiency rank for your commander class DC increases to expert, and you add two new tactics to your folio; these can be any mobility or offensive tactics you don't already know, or you can choose from expert tactics you have access to. The total number of tactics you can have prepared increases to four. In addition, your proficiency rank in Warfare Lore increases to master.

## Weapon SpecializationLevel 7

You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal an additional 2 damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.

## Fortitude ExpertiseLevel 9

Your physique has grown hardy in your adventures. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.

## Armor ExpertiseLevel 11

You have spent so much time in armor that you know how to make the most of its protection. Your proficiency ranks for light, medium, and heavy armor, as well as for unarmored defense, increase to expert. You gain the armor specialization effects of medium and heavy armor.

## Commanding WillLevel 11

You know that if you break, so too will those who follow you, and so you have cultivated a will that bends to no outside force. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.

## Perception MasteryLevel 13

You've developed the ability to see a scenario from every side. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.

## Weapon MasteryLevel 13

You've drilled extensively in your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for unarmed attacks, simple weapons, and martial weapons increase to master.

## Battlefield IntuitionLevel 15

Your experience across a wide array of battlefields gives you a preternatural ability to predict and avoid damaging effects. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Reflex save, you get a critical success instead.

## Greater Weapon Specialization Level 15

Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.

## Master Tactician Level 15

You are among the greatest tacticians to have ever led forces on the field of battle. Your proficiency rank for commander class DC increases to master, and you add two new tactics to your folio; these can be any mobility or offensive tactics you don't already have in your folio, or you can choose from expert tactics or master tactics you have access to. The total number of tactics you can have prepared increases to five. In addition, you gain legendary proficiency in Warfare Lore.

## Armor Mastery Level 17

Your skill with armor improves, helping you avoid more blows. Your proficiency ranks for light, medium, and heavy armor, as well as for unarmored defense, increase to master.

## Legendary Tactician Level 19

You are an unrivaled legend in your use of battlefield tactics. Your proficiency rank for your commander class DC increases to legendary, and you add two new tactics to your folio; these can be any mobility or offensive tactics you don't already have in your folio, or you can choose from expert tactics, master tactics, or legendary tactics you have access to. The total number of tactics you can have prepared increases to six.

All squadmates can Stride up to twice their Speed directly toward the target as a reaction, yelling and trampling. When any squadmate enters a square adjacent to any enemy, that enemy must attempt a `Fortitude check` save against your class DC or take 2d6 bludgeoning damage and 2d6 sonic damage damage, plus an additional 2d6 bludgeoning and 2d6 sonic damage for every squadmate participating in Cry Havoc! (enemies who critically fail are [[Conditions/Deafened|Deafened]] for 1 round). Regardless of the outcome, the enemy is then temporarily immune to any further damage from Cry Havoc! for 24 hours.

Squadmates can use Cry Havoc! while Burrowing, Climbing, Flying, or Swimming instead of Striding if they have the corresponding movement type.

You command your squadmates to act as a lethal firing squad. You and each squadmate within the aura of your commander's banner can attempt a ranged Strike as a reaction against a single target you choose; combine the damage from all attacks for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses. If the designated target is a living creature, these attacks gain the death trait. If the designated target dies as a result of this tactic, all other enemies within the affected area of your commander's banner must succeed at a `Will check` save against your class DC or be [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]]; this is an emotion, fear, and mental effect.

* * *

**Special** If one of your squadmates knows or has prepared a cantrip with a range of 30 feet or more that deals damage and requires 2 or fewer actions to cast, they can cast it targeting the designated enemy instead of taking the other actions normally granted by this tactic, gaining all other listed benefits.

TACTIC

**Frequency** once per day

Your squad quickly assembles a special impromptu ballista and fires it to lethal effect. Signal all squadmates you previously chose to participate in this tactic (see Special); these squadmates must be within the aura of your commander's banner. They can all Stride as a free action to assemble into a close formation; as long as all the chosen squadmates end their movement no more than 10 feet away from any of the other chosen squadmates. They quickly assemble an impromptu ballista and fire it at an enemy of your choice within 200 feet.

This is a ranged Strike using your proficiency bonus with martial weapons and gets an item bonus to the attack roll you make with it equal to the number of assisting squadmates (maximum +4). It deals 10d12 piercing damage. Once the attack is completed, the pieces of the impromptu ballista fall apart.

* * *

**Special** You must choose all squadmates who will participate in this tactic at the time you prepare it. Those squadmates must carry the pieces of your impromptu ballista, which can be made out of easily scavenged materials; these pieces are 8 Bulk in total and can be divided in 1 Bulk increments among any number of the chosen squadmates.

TACTIC

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

Your squad is rejuvenated by the arterial spray of your enemies. Choose a creature within the aura of your commander's banner and signal all squadmates within the aura who are wielding a piercing or slashing melee weapon, or who have a piercing or slashing melee unarmed attack. Those allies can Stride up to half their Speed as a free action. If they end this movement within reach of the designated target, they can Strike the target with the required weapon or unarmed attack as a reaction.

Once all Strikes are completed, if the target took damage and is not immune to bleed damage, it must succeed at a `Fortitude check` saving throw against your class DC or take 10 points of persistent bleed damage. The target takes a circumstance penalty on their save equal to the number of successful Strikes made as part of this tactic (up to a maximum –4 circumstance penalty).

[[Feat_Feature Effects/Effect_ Sanguine Revitalization|Effect: Sanguine Revitalization]]

Your squadmates are energized by the display of your enemy's imminent defeat; each squadmate in a 20-foot emanation is healed for 10d6 healing Hit Points.

TACTIC

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

You and your allies defy death and defeat to make a glorious final charge. You restore 80 healing Hit Points to each squadmate within the aura of your commander's banner; this effect has the healing trait. If an affected ally was [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]] due to their Hit Points being reduced to 0, they can immediately Stand and pick up any dropped weapons as a free action. Then, each affected squadmate can, as a free action, Stride up to twice their Speed directly toward an enemy they are observing; if they end this movement with an enemy within their reach, they can attempt to Strike that enemy as a reaction.

Squadmates can use Valkyrie's Charge while Burrowing, Climbing, Flying, or Swimming instead of Striding if they have the corresponding movement type.
