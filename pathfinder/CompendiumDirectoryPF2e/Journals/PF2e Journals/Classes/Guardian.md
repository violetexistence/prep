# Guardian
_Death and danger from all manner of enemies threaten all that you and your companions hold dear. But you are the shield, the steel wall that holds back the tide of opposition. You're clad in armor you wear like a second skin and can angle it to protect yourself and your allies from damage and keep foes at bay. Allies look to you to safeguard them, whether they stand beside you on the battlefield or remain on the back lines, and enemies see you for the imposing threat you are. Be it to friend or foe, your presence is difficult to ignore._

**Key Attribute: STRENGTH**

At 1st level, your class gives you an attribute boost to Strength

**Hit Points: 12 plus your Constitution modifier**

You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.

# Roleplaying the Guardian

## During Combat Encounters...

You're unparalleled in your use of armor, squeezing every last drop of protection it offers. You take hits meant for your most vulnerable allies. You can also taunt your foes, drawing their ire and attention so they attack you instead of others.

## During Social Encounters...

Depending on your background, you might be friendly or coercive during negotiations. You usually feel more comfortable on the field of battle when you can more easily tell friend from foe, but that doesn't mean you can't bond with other soldiers or those who have had experiences similar to yours.

## While Exploring...

You remain vigilant against possible threats, ready to step up at a moment's notice. Constantly wearing armor has made you stronger, allowing you to surmount physical challenges such as moving heavy objects or scaling walls.

## In Downtime...

Your armor and shield might have gotten damaged during your latest adventures, so you often spend time repairing and maintaining them. You might also earn some extra coin doing manual labor or extra work as a town guard.

## You Might...

*   Stand firm in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds, trusting in the strength of your armor to pull you through.
    
*   Good-naturedly joke about how the damage you’ve taken has effectively saved the lives of your companions.
    
*   Be slow to trust the motives of anyone who isn’t one of your allies, assuming they mean to do you harm.
    

## Others Probably...

*   Appreciate the sturdiness of your armor, especially when it absorbs an attack meant for them.
    
*   Don’t understand why you’d want to put yourself in danger by taunting enemies.
    
*   Feel safer when you’re standing near them on the field of battle.

## Guardian Feats

At 1st level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a guardian class feat.

## Guardian's Armor

Even when you are struck, your armor protects you from some harm. While wearing medium or heavy armor, you gain resistance to physical damage equal to 1 + half your level. In addition, you can rest normally while wearing medium and heavy armor.

## Shield Block

You gain the [[Feats/Shield Block|Shield Block]] general feat, a reaction that lets you reduce damage with your shield.

## Taunt

Often, the best way to protect your allies is to have the enemy want to attack you instead. You gain the [[Actions/Taunt|Taunt]] action.

### Taunt `pf2:1`

CONCENTRATE

GUARDIAN

With an attention-grabbing gesture, noise, cutting remark, or threatening shout, you attempt to draw an enemy to you instead of your allies. Taunt gains the auditory trait, visual trait, or both, depending on how you draw the target's attention. Even mindless creatures are drawn to your taunts. Choose an enemy within 30 feet to be your taunted enemy. If your taunted enemy takes a hostile action that includes at least one of your allies but doesn't include you, they take a –1 circumstance penalty to their attack rolls and DCs for that action, and they also become [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the start of their next turn.

Your enemy remains taunted until the start of your next turn, and you can have only one Taunt in effect at a time. Taunting a new enemy ends this effect on any current target.

[[Feat_Feature Effects/Effect_ Taunt|Effect: Taunt]]

## Guardian's Techniques

As a guardian, you have learned certain techniques to help keep your allies safe.

### Ever Ready

You always gain a reaction whenever you roll initiative for combat, but you can use it only for reactions from guardian feats or class features. The GM might still rule that you can use other reactions before your first turn based on the situation, as normal.

### Intercept Attack

You keep your charges safe from harm, even if it means you get hurt yourself. You gain the [[Actions/Intercept Attack|Intercept Attack]] reaction.

## Skill Feats Level 2

At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. Skill feats have the skill trait. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.

## General Feats Level 3

At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.

## Skill Increases Level 3

At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in or become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained.

At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.

## Tough to Kill Level 3

The protectiveness of your armor ensures that even if you fall, you take longer to die. You gain the [[Feats/Diehard|Diehard]] general feat. If you already have the Diehard feat, you can retrain it when you get Tough to Kill. Additionally, the first time each day you'd be reduced to [[Conditions/Dying|Dying]] 3 or higher, you stay at dying 2 instead.

## Ancestry FeatsLevel 5

In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.

## Unbreakable ExpertiseLevel 5

You've studied in a wide variety of weapons and learned to apply their principles in combat. Your proficiency rank for martial weapons, simple weapons, and unarmed attacks increases to expert. When you critically succeed at an attack roll with a weapon you are at least an expert with, you apply the weapon's critical specialization effect.

## Weapon ExpertiseLevel 5

Sometimes, the best defense is a good offense. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increase to expert.

## Reaction TimeLevel 7

You're always on the lookout for danger and can react to it in an instant. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert. At the start of each of your turns, you gain an additional reaction that you can use only for reactions from guardian feats or class features (including [[Feats/Shield Block|Shield Block]]). If you have the Ever Ready class feature, you also gain this additional reaction when you roll initiative for combat.

## Reflex ExpertiseLevel 7

You've developed a knack for dodging danger. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.

**Guardian** Even in the heaviest of armors, you can brace yourself against widespread effects. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.

## Battle HardenedLevel 9

Your experience in battle helps protect you against magic and toxins alike. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.

## Guardian ExpertiseLevel 9

Your armored form is more imposing. Your proficiency rank for your guardian class DC increases to expert.

## Unbreakable MasteryLevel 11

When clad in steel, you fend off most attacks. Your proficiency rank with medium armor and heavy armor increases to master. Your proficiency rank with light armor and unarmored defense increases to expert.

## Weapon SpecializationLevel 11

You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal an additional 2 damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.

## Weapon Mastery Level 13

You've drilled extensively in your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for unarmed attacks, simple weapons, and martial weapons increase to master.

## Unbreakable LegendLevel 15

You have become an almost-impenetrable bulwark. Your proficiency ranks for medium and heavy armor increase to legendary. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense increase to master.

## Greater Weapon SpecializationLevel 17

Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.

## Unyielding ResolveLevel 17

Stalwart as your armor, you refuse to break. Your proficiency ranks for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.

## Guardian MasteryLevel 19

You are known for your suit of armor more than the person inside. Your proficiency rank for your guardian class DC increases to master. While wearing armor, when you attempt a Reflex save to avoid a damaging effect, such as a [[Spells/Fireball|Fireball]], you can add your armor’s item bonus to AC instead of your Dexterity modifier; if your armor has the bulwark trait, increase this bonus by 1. If you get a success when you do this, you get a critical success instead.
