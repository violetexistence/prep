# Alchemist
_There's no sight more beautiful to you than a strange brew bubbling in a beaker, and you consume your ingenious elixirs with abandon. You're fascinated by uncovering the secrets of science and the natural world, and you're constantly experimenting in your lab or on the go with inventive concoctions for every eventuality. You are fearless in the face of risk, hurling explosive or toxic creations at your foes. Your unique path toward greatness is lined with alchemical brews that push your mind and body to their limits._

**Key Attribute: INTELLIGENCE**

At 1st level, your class gives you an attribute boost to Intelligence

**Hit Points: 8 plus your Constitution modifier**

You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.

# Roleplaying the Alchemist

## During Combat Encounters...

You lob bombs at your foes, harry your enemies, and support the rest of your party with potent elixirs. You might even use mutagens to warp your body into a resilient and powerful weapon.

## During Social Encounters...

You provide knowledge and experience about alchemical items and related secrets, such as poisons and diseases.

## While Exploring...

You keep an eye out for for additional ingredients that you can turn into alchemical reagents, while giving advice on all things alchemical and mysterious.

## In Downtime...

You experiment in an alchemical lab, brewing elixirs, making bombs, and furthering your alchemical knowledge.

## You Might...

*   Enjoy tinkering with strange formulas and alchemical reagents, often with a single-minded dedication and recklessness that gives others pause.
*   Get a kick out of wreaking havoc with the alchemical concoctions you've made, and enjoy watching things burn, dissolve, freeze, and jolt.
*   Endlessly experiment to discover new, more potent alchemical tools.

## Others Probably...

*   Think you're some kind of sorcerer or an eccentric wizard and don't understand that you don't cast spells; spellcasters who clumsily dabble in alchemy only heighten this misconception.
*   Don't understand your zeal for alchemy, creativity, and invention.
*   Assume that if you haven't caused a catastrophe with your experimentations, you inevitably will.

## Ancestry and Background

In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.

## Attribute Boosts

In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.

## Initial Proficiencies

At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.

## Alchemy

You understand the reactions between all manner of reagents and can concoct alchemical items to meet your needs. You can do this using normal reagents and the Craft activity, or you can use specially prepared chemicals that allow you to craft temporary items quickly and at no cost. Over time, you can create more and more alchemical items for free, and since each of them becomes more and more powerful, you advance in power dramatically, leaving behind those who don't understand your strange science.

You gain the [[Feats/Alchemical Crafting|Alchemical Crafting]] feat, and you can automatically identify alchemical items that you have the formula for.

### **Formula Book**

An alchemist keeps meticulous formulas for every item they can create. You start with a standard [[Equipment/Formula Book (Blank)|Formula Book]] for free. The formula book contains the formulas for two common 1st-level alchemical items of your choice, in addition to any formulas you gained from [[Feats/Alchemical Crafting|Alchemical Crafting]] and your research field.

Each time you gain a level, you can add the formulas for two common alchemical items to your formula book. These new formulas can be for any level of item you can create. You learn these formulas automatically, but it's also possible to find or buy additional formulas in settlements or from other alchemists, or to select the [[Feats/Inventor|Inventor]] skill feat so you can invent them.

As normal, having the base formula is sufficient when Crafting upgraded types of the item—you don't need to learn higher-level formulas. For instance, if you have the 1st-level formula for a minor elixir of life, you can create a minor, lesser, moderate, greater, major, or true elixir of life as long as you meet the level and other prerequisites. Items with type entries that have widely varied functions require separate formulas, but most alchemical items have a structure similar to elixir of life.

### **Advanced Alchemy**

During your daily preparations, you spend some time to create alchemical items that can be used over the course of the day.

You don't need to attempt a Crafting check to do this, you can use an alchemist's toolkit instead of an alchemist's lab, and you ignore both the number of days typically required to create the items and any alchemical raw materials requirements.

You can Craft a number of alchemical items up to 4 + your Intelligence modifier. Each item must be in your formula book, have an item level equal to or lower than your level, and have the consumable trait.

These items have the infused trait and remain potent for 24 hours or until your next daily preparations, whichever comes first.

### **Versatile Vials**

You know how to prepare fast-acting chemicals into versatile vials, special items that can be used as bombs and be turned into other alchemical items by introducing special reagents. During your daily preparations, you can create a number of versatile vials up to 2 + your Intelligence modifier, which is also your maximum number of vials. If you're below your maximum number, you can gather reagents from the environment around you. For every 10 minutes you spend in exploration mode, you regain 2 vials; this doesn't prevent you from participating in other exploration activities.

Versatile vials are infused items, and are destroyed if not used by the next time you make your daily preparations. A vial you create is always the highest type you could Craft. See the sidebar for statistics on using a versatile vial as a bomb. You can also use vials for [[Class Features/Quick Alchemy|Quick Alchemy]] and your research field can add to the ways you can use a vial.

You can store all your versatile vials within your [[Equipment/Alchemist's Toolkit|Alchemist's Toolkit]], with no increase to its Bulk. Though versatile vials are physical objects, they can't be duplicated or preserved in any way.

The versatile vials can be thrown like bombs, with the following statistics.

  

| **VERSATILE VIAL**<br/>* * *<br/>ACID<br/>ALCHEMICAL<br/>BOMB<br/>CONSUMABLE<br/>INFUSED<br/>SPLASH<br/>**Usage** held 1 hand; **Bulk** —<br/>**Activate** `pf2:1` Strike<br/>* * *<br/>This tiny glass flask contains volatile chemicals that can be used offensively in a pinch.<br/>* * *<br/>**Type** lesser; **Level** 1<br/>The bomb deals 1d6 acid damage and 1 acid splash damage.<br/>* * *<br/>**Type** moderate; **Level** 4<br/>You gain a +1 item bonus to attack rolls. The bomb deals 2d6 acid damage and 2 acid splash damage.<br/>* * *<br/>**Type** greater; **Level** 12<br/>You gain a +2 item bonus to attack rolls. The bomb deals 3d6 acid damage and 3 acid splash damage<br/>* * *<br/>**Type** major; **Level** 18<br/>You gain a +3 item bonus to attack rolls. The bomb deals 4d6 acid damage and 4 acid splash damage |
| --- |

### **Quick Alchemy**

You gain the [[Actions/Quick Alchemy|Quick Alchemy]] action to make the items you need on the fly.

## Research Field

Your inquiries into the alchemical nature of the universe have led you to focus on a particular field of research. At 1st level, you choose your research field. This choice gives you more formulas, a special benefit, other abilities for your versatile vials, and other benefits as you level up.
