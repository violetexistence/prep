# Swashbuckler
_Many warriors rely on brute force, weighty armor, or cumbersome weapons. For you, battle is a dance where you move among foes with style and grace. You dart among combatants with flair and land powerful finishing moves with a flick of the wrist and a flash of the blade, all while countering attacks with elegant ripostes that keep enemies off balance. Harassing and thwarting your foes lets you charm fate and cheat death time and again with aplomb and plenty of flair._

**Key Attribute: DEXTERITY**

At 1st level, your class gives you an attribute boost to Dexterity.

**Hit Points: 10 plus your Constitution modifier**

You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.

# Roleplaying the Swashbuckler

## During Combat Encounters...

You show off to gain panache, leveraging your flair to build up to powerful finishing moves. You stay nimble, moving into the best position to perform your maneuvers while dodging enemy blows and responding with swift ripostes. Depending on your swashbuckler's style, you might dance among your foes; slip past their defenses; or beguile, distract, or frighten them.

## During Social Encounters...

You are equally likely to charm or intimidate others-or both. You might be an adept socialite, or you might create distractions for others who do the talking.

## While Exploring...

You keep a careful eye on your surroundings and other people, always prepared to leap into action with bravado and flair. You interact with the environment in bold, sweeping strokes rather than skulking to avoid detection.

## In Downtime...

You might carouse at the tavern, repair and maintain your armaments, or train to learn new techniques. To maintain your impressive reputation, you might build an organization in your name or establish a following of admirers.

## You Might...

*   Portray yourself as a heroic daredevil or a roguish braggart, knowing you can live up to the image you present.
*   Hold yourself in high esteem, confident in your abilities and your reputation.
*   Practice your skills and maneuvers regularly to ensure you never grow rusty.

## Others Probably...

*   Admire your theatrics, bravado, and skill with a blade.
*   Find you arrogant unless they know you well enough to appreciate your style.
*   Underestimate how much of a threat you pose until they face the end of your deadly blade.

## Ancestry and Background

In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.

## Initial Proficiencies

At 1st level you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.

## Panache

You care as much about the way you accomplish something as whether you actually accomplish it in the first place. When you perform an action with particular style, you can leverage this moment of verve to perform spectacular, deadly maneuvers. This heightened state of flair is called panache.

[[Feat_Feature Effects/Effect_ Panache|Effect: Panache]]

You gain panache by performing actions that have the bravado trait. [[Actions/Tumble Through|Tumble Through]] and additional actions determined by your swashbuckler's style gain the bravado trait when you use them. The GM might determine that a check to perform a particularly daring action, such as swinging on a chandelier or sliding down a drapery, can gain the bravado trait. These checks typically involve at least a single action and a non-trivial DC. Normally, you gain and use panache only in combat encounters; when an encounter ends, you lose panache.

Powerful finisher actions, including [[Actions/Confident Finisher|Confident Finisher]], can be used only while you have panache and cause you to lose your panache.

## Precise Strike

When you make a Strike with an agile or finesse melee weapon or agile or finesse unarmed attack, you deal 2 additional precision damage. If the Strike is part of a finisher, the additional damage is 2d6 precision damage instead.

As your swashbuckler level increases, so does your additional damage for precise strike. At 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level, increase the amount of additional damage on a Strike by 1 and the additional damage on a finisher by 1d6.
