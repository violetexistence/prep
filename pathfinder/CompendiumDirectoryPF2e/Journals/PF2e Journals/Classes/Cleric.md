# Cleric
_Deities work their will upon the world in infinite ways, and you serve as one of their most stalwart mortal servants. Blessed with divine magic, you live the ideals of your faith, adorn yourself with the symbols of your church, and train diligently to wield your deity's favored weapon. Your spells might protect and heal your allies, or they might punish foes and enemies of your faith, as your deity wills. Yours is a life of devotion, spreading the teachings of your faith through both word and deed._

**Key Attribute: WISDOM**

At 1st level, your class gives you an attribute boost to Wisdom.

**Hit Points: 8 plus your Constitution modifier**

You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.

# Roleplaying the Cleric

## During Combat Encounters...

If you're a warpriest, you balance between casting spells and attacking with weapons- typically the favored weapon of your deity. If you're a cloistered cleric, you primarily cast spells. Most of your spells can boost, protect, or heal your allies. Depending on your deity, you get extra spells to heal your allies or harm your enemies.

## During Social Encounters...

You might make diplomatic overtures or deliver impressive speeches. Because you're wise, you also pick up on falsehoods others tell.

## While Exploring...

You detect nearby magic and interpret any religious writing you come across. You might also concentrate on a protective spell for your allies in case of attack. After a battle or hazard, you might heal anyone who was hurt.

## In Downtime...

You might perform services at a temple, travel to spread the word of your deity, research scripture, celebrate holy days, or even found a new temple.

## You Might...

*   Visit the temples and holy places sacred to your faith, and have an immediate affinity with other worshippers of your deity.
*   Know the teachings of your religion's holy texts and how they apply to a dilemma.
*   Cooperate with your allies, provided they don't ask you to go against divine will.

## Others Probably...

*   Find your devotion impressive, even if they don't understand it.
*   Expect you to heal their wounds.
*   Rely on you to interact with other religious figures.

## Ancestry and Background

In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.

## Deity

As a cleric, you are a mortal servitor of a deity you revere above all others. Your deity grants you the trained proficiency rank in one skill and with the deity's favored weapon. If the favored weapon is uncommon, you also get access to that weapon.

Your deity also adds spells to your spell list. You can prepare these just like you can any spell on the divine spell list once you can prepare spells of their rank as a cleric. Any of these spells that aren't normally on the divine list are still divine spells if you prepare them this way.

## Sanctification

Depending on your deity, their sanctification can make you holy or unholy. This gives you the holy or unholy trait, which commits you to one side of a struggle over the souls of the planes and may be referenced in other abilities. If you "can be" holy or unholy according to your deity, you make that choice, and if you "must be" holy or unholy you gain the trait automatically. If you gain the opposing trait in some way, you lose the previous trait until you complete an atone ritual.

## Anathema

Acts fundamentally opposed to your deity's ideals are anathema to your faith. Learning or casting spells, committing acts, and using items that are anathema to your deity remove you from your deity's good graces.

Casting spells with the unholy trait is almost always anathema to deities who don't allow unholy sanctification, and casting holy spells is likewise anathema to those who don't allow holy sanctification. Similarly, casting spells that are anathema to the tenets or goals of your faith could interfere with your connection to your deity. For example, casting a spell to create undead would be anathema to Pharasma, the goddess of death. Many actions that are anathema don't appear in any deity's formal list. For borderline cases, you and your GM determine which acts are anathema.

If you perform enough acts that are anathema to your deity, you lose the magical abilities that come from your connection to your deity. The class features that you lose are determined by the GM, but they likely include your divine font and all cleric spellcasting. These abilities can be regained only if you repent by conducting an atone ritual.

## Divine Font

Through your deity's blessing, you gain additional spells that channel either the life force called vitality or its counterforce, the void. When you prepare your spells each day, you can prepare additional [[Spells/Heal|Heal]] or [[Spells/Harm|Harm]] spells, depending on your deity. The divine font spell your deity provides is listed in the Divine Font entry for your deity; if both are listed, you can choose between _heal_ or _harm_. Once you choose, you can't change your choice short of divine intervention.

**Healing Font:** You gain 4 additional spell slots each day at your highest rank of cleric spell slots. You can prepare only _heal_ spells in these slots. At 5th level, the number of additional slots increases to 5, and at 15th level, the total number of additional slots increases to 6.

**Harmful Font:** You gain 4 additional spell slots each day at your highest rank of cleric spell slots. You can prepare only _harm_ spells in these slots. At 5th level, the number of additional slots increases to 5, and at 15th level, the total number of additional slots increases to 6.

## Cleric Spellcasting

Your deity bestows on you the power to cast divine spells. You are a spellcaster, and you can cast spells of the divine tradition using the Cast a Spell activity. As a cleric, your chants generally invoke your deity and their powerful servants by name or title, while your gestures are followed by sacred symbols or other representations of your deity.

At 1st level, you can prepare two 1st-rank spells and five cantrips each morning from the common spells on the divine spell list or from other divine spells to which you gain access and learn via Learn a Spell. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare each day is called your spell slots.

As you increase in level as a cleric, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest rank of spell you can cast, as shown in Cleric Spells per Day table above.

Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are or for your enemies to roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Wisdom, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Wisdom modifier.

## Heightening Spells

When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks.

## Cantrips

Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded upâ€”this is usually equal to the highest rank of cleric spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level cleric, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level cleric, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.

  

| Your Level | Cantrips | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th | 5th | 6th | 7th | 8th | 9th | 10th |

| \* Your divine font gives you additional _heal_ or _harm_ spells of this rank. The number is 4 at 1st level, 5 at 5th level, and 6 at 15th level.<br/>â€  The miraculous spell class feature gives you a 10th-rank spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

## Doctrine

Even among followers of the same deity, approaches vary. At 1st level, you select cloistered cleric or warpriest and gain the benefits of its first doctrine. At 3rd level and every four levels thereafter, you gain another benefit from your doctrine.

## Initial Proficiencies

At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training, noted at the start of this class.

## Cleric Feats Level 2

At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a cleric class feat.

You can use any of these skill increases you gain at 7th level or higher to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and any of these skill increases you gain at 15th level or higher to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.

## Attribute Boosts Level 5

In addition to the boost to Wisdom you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers.

At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost, and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.

## Miraculous Spell Level 19

You're exalted by your deity and gain truly incredible spells. You gain a single 10th-rank spell slot and can prepare a spell in that slot using cleric spellcasting. Unlike with other spell slots, you can't use 10-rank slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots. You don't gain more 10th-rank spells as you level up, but you can take the [[Feats/Maker of Miracles|Maker of Miracles]] feat to gain a second slot.
