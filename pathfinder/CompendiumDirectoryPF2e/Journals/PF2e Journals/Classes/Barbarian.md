# Barbarian
_Rage consumes you in battle. You delight in wreaking havoc and using powerful weapons to carve through your enemies, relying on astonishing durability without needing complicated techniques or rigid training. Your rages draw upon a vicious instinct, which you might associate with an animal, a spirit, or some part of yourself. To many barbarians, brute force is a hammer and every problem looks like a nail, whereas others try to hold back the storm of emotions inside them and release their rage only when it matters most._

**Key Attribute: STRENGTH**

At 1st level, your class gives you an attribute boost to Strength.

**Hit Points: 12 plus your Constitution modifier**

You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.

# Roleplaying the Barbarian

## During Combat Encounters...

You summon your rage and rush to the front lines to smash your way through. Offense is your best defense-you'll need to drop foes before they can exploit your relatively low defenses.

## During Social Encounters...

You use intimidation to get what you need, especially when gentler persuasion can't get the job done.

## While Exploring...

You look out for danger, ready to rush headfirst into battle in an instant. You climb the challenging rock wall and drop a rope for others to follow, and you wade into the risky currents to reach the hidden switch beneath the water's surface. If something needs breaking, you're up to the task!

## In Downtime...

You might head to a tavern to carouse, build up the fearsome legend of your mighty deeds, or recruit followers to become a warlord in your own right.

## You Might...

*   Have a deep-seated well of anger, hatred, or frustration.
*   Prefer a straightforward approach to one requiring patience and tedium.
*   Engage in a regimen of intense physical fitness-and punch anyone who says this conflicts with your distaste for patience and tedium.

## Others Probably...

*   Rely on your courage and your strength, and trust that you can hold your own in a fight.
*   See you as uncivilized or a boorish lout unfit for high society.
*   Believe that you are loyal to your friends and allies and will never relent until the fight is done.

## Ancestry and Background

In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.

## Attribute Boosts

In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.

## Initial Proficiencies

At 1st level you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted in at the start of this class.

## Rage

You gain the Rage action, which lets you fly into a frenzy.

### [[Actions/Rage|Rage]] `pf2:1`

**Requirements** You aren't [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]] or raging.

* * *

You tap into your inner fury and begin raging. You gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to your level plus your Constitution modifier. While you are raging:

*   You deal 2 additional damage on melee Strikes. This additional damage is halved if your weapon or unarmed attack is agile.
*   You can't use actions with the concentrate trait unless they also have the rage trait. You can [[Actions/Seek|Seek]] while raging. Rage lasts for 1 minute, until you fall [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]], or until the encounter ends, whichever comes first. You can't voluntarily stop raging. When you stop raging, you lose any remaining temporary Hit Points from Rage, and can't gain temporary Hit Points from using the Rage action again for 1 minute.
    

## Quick-Tempered

You gain the [[Actions/Quick-Tempered|Quick-Tempered]] free action, which lets you [[Actions/Rage|Rage]] at the slightest provocation.

### Quick-Tempered `pf2:0`

**Trigger** You roll initiative.

**Requirements** You are not encumbered or wearing heavy armor.

* * *

So long as you are able to move freely, your fury is instinctive and instantaneous. You Rage.

## Instinct

Your rage wells up from a dominant instinctâ€”one you learned from a tradition or that comes naturally to you. Your instinct gives you an ability, requires you to avoid certain behaviors, grants you increased damage and resistances at higher levels, and allows you to select feats tied to your instinct.

Instincts can be found here: [[Class Features/Animal Instinct|Animal Instinct]], [[Class Features/Dragon Instinct|Dragon Instinct]], [[Class Features/Elemental Instinct|Elemental Instinct]], [[Class Features/Fury Instinct|Fury Instinct]], [[Class Features/Giant Instinct|Giant Instinct]], [[Class Features/Spirit Instinct|Spirit Instinct]], and [[Class Features/Superstition Instinct|Superstition Instinct]].

## Barbarian Feats

At 1st level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a barbarian class feat.

## Skill Feats Level 2

At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.

## Furious Footfalls Level 3

The urge to fight drives you ever forward. You gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speed. This bonus increases to +10 feet while you're raging.

## General Feats Level 3

At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.

## Skill Increases Level 3

At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.

At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.

## Ancestry Feats Level 5

In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.

## Brutality Level 5

Your fury makes your weapons lethal. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increase to expert. While raging, you have the critical specialization benefits for melee weapons and unarmed attacks.

## Juggernaut Level 7

Your body is accustomed to physical hardship and resistant to ailments. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.

## Weapon Specialization Level 7

You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal an additional 2 damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.

## Raging Resistance Level 9

Repeated exposure and toughened skin allow you to fend off harm. While raging, you gain resistance equal to 3 + your Constitution modifier to damage types based on your instinct.

## Reflex Expertise Level 9

You've developed a knack for dodging danger. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.

**Guardian** Even in the heaviest of armors, you can brace yourself against widespread effects. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.

## Mighty Rage Level 11

Your rage intensifies and lets you hit harder at the start of a fight. Your proficiency rank for your barbarian class DC increases to expert. In addition, when you use Quick-Tempered, the first Strike you make during your first turn deals additional damage equal to your [[Actions/Rage|Rage]] damage.

## Greater Juggernaut Level 13

You have a stalwart physiology. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to legendary. When you roll a critical failure on a Fortitude save, you get a failure instead. When you roll a failure on a Fortitude save against an effect that deals damage, you halve the damage you take.

## Medium Armor Expertise Level 13

You've learned to defend yourself better against attacks. Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium armor, and unarmored defense increase to expert.

## Weapon Mastery Level 13

Your rage makes you even more effective with the weapons you wield. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increase to master.

## Greater Weapon Specialization Level 15

The weapons you've mastered become truly fearsome in your hands. Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.

You gain a greater benefit from your instinct's specialization ability. See specific instincts for more information.

## Indomitable Will Level 15

Your rage makes it difficult to control you. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.

## Perception Mastery Level 17

Your instinct heightens each of your senses further. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.

## Revitalizing Rage Level 17

## Armor Mastery Level 19

Your training and rage deepen your connection to your armor. Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium armor, and unarmored defense increase to master.

## Devastator Level 19

Your Strikes are so devastating that you hardly care about resistance, and your barbarian abilities are unparalleled. Your proficiency rank for your barbarian class DC increases to master. Your melee Strikes ignore up to 10 resistance to the physical damage they deal.
