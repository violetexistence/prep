# Dwarf
Dwarves have a well-earned reputation as a stoic and stern people, but they also have an unbridled zeal and deeply value artisanship. To a stranger, they can seem untrusting and clannish, but to their friends and family, they are warm and caring. While trust from a dwarf is hard-won, once gained it is as strong as iron.

If you want to play a character who is as hard as nails, a stubborn and unrelenting adventurer, with a mix of rugged toughness and deep wisdom, you should play a dwarf.

## You Might...

*   Strive to uphold your personal honor and refuse to back down
*   Appreciate quality craftsmanship in all forms and insist upon it for all your gear.

## Others Probably...

*   See you as stubborn, though whether this is an asset or a detriment changes from moment to moment.
*   Recognize the deep connection you have with your family, heritage, and friends.

## Physical Description

Dwarves are short and stocky, standing about a foot shorter than most humans. They have wide, compact bodies and burly frames. Dwarves of all genders pride themselves on the length of their hair and beards, which they often braid into intricate patterns, some of which represent specific clans. A long beard is a sign of maturity and honor among many dwarf clans.

Dwarves typically reach physical adulthood around the age of 25, though their traditionalist culture places more value on completing coming-of-age ceremonies unique to each clan than reaching a certain age. A typical dwarf can live to around 350 years old.

## Society

Though the ancient dwarven empire fell long ago, overwhelmed by orc and goblinoid enemies, dwarves today retain many of the qualities that once propelled them to greatness: fierceness, gumption, and stubbornness in their endeavors. Dwarves live within mountain Sky Citadels dotted over the surface, which can create vast cultural divides between dwarf clans. Yet nearly all dwarven peoples share a passion for stonework, metalwork, and family.

Few dwarves are seen without their clan dagger strapped to their belt. This dagger is forged just before a dwarf's birth and is distinctive to their clan. Dwarves honor their children with names of ancestors or dwarven heroes. When introducing themselves, dwarves tend to list their family and clan, plus any number of other familial connections and honorifics.

### Sample Names

Agna, Bodill, Edrukk, Grunyar, Ingra, Kotri, Morgrym, Rogar, Torra, Yangrit

## Beliefs

Dwarves tend to value honor and closely follow the traditions of their clans and kingdoms. They have a strong sense of friendship and justice, though they are often very particular about who they consider a friend. They work hard and play harderâ€”especially when strong ale is involved. Torag, god of dwarvenkind, is dwarves' primary deity, though worship of Torag's family members is also common.
