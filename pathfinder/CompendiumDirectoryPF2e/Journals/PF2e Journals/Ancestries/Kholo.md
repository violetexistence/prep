# Kholo
Kholo have bad reputations as brutal raiders and demon-worshipers. Many believe that kholos are witches, cannibals, and worse. The truth is more complex. Kholos are eminently practical and pragmatic hunters and raiders. To them, honor is just another word for pointless risk. Any loss of a kholo affects not just the individual, but their packmates and kin as well. Wasting time on anything but victory, whether it's mercy or cruelty, is seen as little shy of immoral. Kholos are masters of ambushes, tactical feints, and psychological warfare. Equally misunderstood is the kholo practice of ancestor worship and endocannibalism. Kholos consume their dead as a sign of reverence, holding a grand feast and transforming the bones into art or weapons. Kholos extend this honor to respected foes, hoping to bring their enemy's cunning or strength into the clan.

## You might...

*   Be physically demonstrative—hugging, punching, or licking your friends.
*   Keep a bone from a favorite relative to ask for advice.
    

## Others Probably...

*   Are intimidated by your size, teeth, and eerie laugh.
*   Respect the brutal efficiency of your hunting style.
    

## Physical Description

Kholo are hyena-like humanoids with short muzzles, sharp teeth, and large and expressive round ears. Their bodies are covered in shaggy fur, rougher on the back and softer and lighter on the stomach and throat, usually in an off-white, tan, or brown shade; spots and stripes are both common. Kholos typically stand between 6 and 7 feet tall. Women are usually about a head taller than men and correspondingly stronger. Kholos are considered adults at 15 and live about 60 years on average.

## Society

Kholo generally live in semi-nomadic clans of 10 to 20 family groups, containing between 100 to 200 members. They are ruled by a council of female kholos who are typically selected from the elders of each family. Bonekeepers focus on tending to the wishes of kholo ancestors and gods—they take their name from the ancestral bones that festoon their clothing and homes. Storytellers serve as teachers and sages, and are expected to have an encyclopedic knowledge of clan history, regional lore, and anything else relevant to the clan.

Newborn kholos are given a root name, typically that of a bone, plant, or animal (though never Hyena, as this is considered narcissistic). As a kholo reaches certain milestones in their life, they add descriptors to their name.

**Sample Names:** Baobab, Jackal, Onyx Elephant in Shadows, Red Thorn, Unbent Iron Reed, White Acacia, Wistful Tooth, Woodpecker

## Beliefs

Kholo have an unsentimental, matter-of-fact approach to life and prioritize results over methods. They are usually loyal and generous to their people and ruthless toward outsiders—whether this behavior is considered acceptable varies depending on who they view as "their people."

Many kholos pay homage to Lamashtu, both as the originator of their people and a guide in a chaotic world. However, some kholos often give homage to Calistria and Shelyn. Nethys is the patron of bonekeepers
