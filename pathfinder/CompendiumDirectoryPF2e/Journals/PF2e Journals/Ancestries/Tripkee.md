# Tripkee
Tripkees are a shy and cautious people who generally seek to avoid being drawn into the affairs of others. Despite their cautious outlook and small stature, adventurous tripkees still take bold and noble action when the situation demands it.

Tripkees are reclusive treetop survivalists who harvest their homes' bounty, utilizing their canopy homes as natural fortifications against the threats posed by larger predators. Their reliance on cunning and simple tools has led to tripkees often being mischaracterized as rudimentary, though this does poor justice to their skill in the cultivation of hidden orchards and camouflaged causeways tucked away in treetop nations. Tripkees are most likely to emerge from their forest homes to trade, explore, and combat threats that would despoil the world.

If you want a character who is small in stature but large in spirit, and possesses qualities of a tree frog, you should play a tripkee.

## You might...

*   Seek out clever ways to exploit your environment when overcoming challenges.
*   Make friends slowly, concerned by cautionary tales of exploitative strangers.
    

## Others Probably...

*   Trust in your impartial, measured approach to understanding situations and solving problems.
*   Give you space, fearing that touching you would prove toxic.
    

## Physical Description

Tripkees resemble humanoid tree frogs, with oversized eyes, wide mouths, and gangly physiques. Their slight frames and large toes can afford excellent grip while climbing, while their colorful skin provides reliable camouflage that varies by their home environmentâ€”green and brown for jungle-dwelling groups, blue and orange for riparian communities, and many other colors between. A tripkee grows quickly, reaching their adult size of approximately 2 feet in height about 3 years after hatching, though they're only considered adults around age 12. Tripkees rarely live beyond 60 years, though exceptional individuals occasionally live as long as a century.

## Society

Tripkees lead a sophisticated hunter-gatherer lifestyle within which they reshape the landscape to suit their needs: building spillways to trap fish, seeding fruit-bearing trees, sowing cover-granting foliage for future hunts, and more techniques that often escape an agriculturist's eye. These strategies rely on community cooperation as well as dispersed populations, so tripkees commonly live in small villages, each part of a complex web of alliances and relationships. Reclusiveness has preserved tripkee lives and lifestyles for millennia, yet they increasingly find themselves threatened by ancient evils and new explorers alike.

Tripkee names often include resonant vowels and chirped consonants that remain difficult for nontripkees to vocalize properly. Tripkees that travel widely often adopt one or more names more easily replicated by their associates.

## Beliefs

Taught to wait, observe, and respect natural processes of life and death, many tripkees adopt patient attitudes. Those who take a more active role suppressing cruelty may join organizations that blend religion and philosophy, such as the tripkee fiend-keepers who absorb an unholy being into their soul to contain and eventually transform its villainy through their own virtuous acts. Nature deities like Gozreh or Erastil often earn tripkees' respect, yet communities usually prefer less prominent, more intimate divinities such as empyreal lords, psychopomp ushers, or the fey Eldest
