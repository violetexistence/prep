# Lizardfolk
Lizardfolk are consummate survivors, heirs to empires considered ancient even by the elves.

Lizardfolk move through the societies of other humanoids with the steely reserve of born predators. They have a well-deserved reputation as outstanding rangers and unsentimental fighters. Though lizardfolk have adapted to many different environments, many of them still prefer to remain near bodies of water, using their ability to hold their breath to their advantage. As a result, they usually prefer equipment that is not easily damaged by moisture, eschewing leather and metal for gear made of stone, ivory, glass, and bone.

## You might...

*   Hold your people's history in high regard and look to the past for solutions to present problems.
*   Strive to adapt perfectly to your environment while also keeping your culture and traditions intact.
    

## Others Probably...

*   Assume you are beholden to tradition and have ancient knowledge.
*   See you as cold-blooded and callous due to your subdued physical reactions.
    

## Physical Description

Lizardfolk vary depending on their environment, but share toothy snouts and long, powerful tails. Many sport dorsal spikes or flashy neck frills that hint at their clan lineage. Lizardfolk reach physical adulthood at age 15 and live up to 120 years. The average lizardfolk stands 6 to 7 feet tall, but grows throughout their lifetime, gaining strength and size with age.

## Society

Known among themselves as iruxis, lizardfolk are raised communally from the moment they break from their shells. They have an oral tradition stretching back thousands of years, brought to life through epic poems, evocative carvings, and ancestral rites performed among fields of fossilized bone. Lizardfolk are passionate astrologers with one eye on the future. If they seem slow to act, it's because their long history has taught them the value of patience.

True iruxi settlements are often overlooked, as they are partially or mostly submerged in water. Lizardfolk bones often adorn the walls, as many lizardfolk believe these remains can be animated by ancestral spirits when the residents are in danger.

Lizardfolk names are typically chosen by the clan's astrologer in accordance to omens and which star signs are ascendant when an iruxi egg hatches.

### Sample Names

## Beliefs

Most iruxis are unconcerned with heavy questions of morality and focus their efforts on a local level. Iruxi religion plays a large role in their culture, but in a heavily practical way, blending animism and ancestor worship with druidic rites. Of the gods, only Gozreh is commonly revered.
