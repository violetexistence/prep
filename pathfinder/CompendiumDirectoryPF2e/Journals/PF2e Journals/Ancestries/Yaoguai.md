# Yaoguai
Yaoguai usually begin as simple animals, plants, or objects before finding a way to awaken to sapience, becoming strange shapeshifting creatures in the process. Often originating from an infusion of ambient energy into their original form, yaoguai attain their powers through training their innate magic. Taking care not to expose their true appearance and nature, yaoguai of the same origins or species sometimes form enclaves in which they dedicate their lives to honing their powers or engaging in hedonistic pursuits—though the two aren't mutually exclusive. Yaoguai who lack a solid community, meanwhile, feel compelled to cultivate themselves until they transcend their origin, which might allow them to join society and experience a new kind of freedom.

Sometimes, extraplanar beings or humanoids are transformed into yaoguai by rituals, arcane mishaps, or sheer coincidence. For some, this occurrence was their heart's desire, though others see their transformation as divine punishment for a misdeed they committed. For those wishing to change back, a long journey of atonement or discovery lies ahead, while those who accept their new forms seek ways to solidify their control over these innate gifts and amass power.

If you want to play a character who seeks to change themself fundamentally through power, experience, or transcendence, you should play a yaoguai.

## You Might...

*   Keep an ear out for ways to attain, unlock, or train your power such that you can transcend your being.
*   Distrust the intentions of others if they're capable of harming you, especially other yaoguai.
*   Be insulted when your abilities are questioned.

## Others Probably...

*   Show interest or awe at the powers you wield or have at your disposal.
*   Are shocked and dismayed to learn that your true shape isn't the form you appear to be.
*   Assume you're malicious by nature and envious of society in general.

## Physical Description

A yaoguai's original form can be virtually anything. It's faster to conclude that if something exists, so long as it basks in the perfect conditions for enough time—usually on the scale of thousands of years—it might just become a yaoguai. Yaoguai inherit a wide range of features based on their pre-awakened form; a yaoguai born of animals might have fur or pointed ears; one derived from an object might have stone- or metal-like skin. Due to their wild appearances, many adventuring yaoguai travel by night, which invites suspicion. Thus, shapeshifting into a humanoid form is one of the many arts yaoguai practice meticulously, even if all they can achieve is a form that retains many of their yaoguai features. Some yaoguai prefer such a form. Perhaps they're confident that they have nothing to hide or they like the ease of access to their yaoguai powers in this incomplete form. Others aim to perfect their humanoid form until they become indistinguishable from any other humanoid creature. Many yaoguai are born adults, though their humanoid forms can be of any apparent age. The average life span of yaoguai, in general, is often a reflection of their power. The most powerful yaoguai can easily challenge the life span of dragons, living up to several thousand years, if not becoming agelessly immortal. Rumors abound, therefore, that yaoguai might have ruled much of Tian Xia once upon a time.

## Society

Roughly three types of yaoguai exist: those who stick with other yaoguai, those who hop in and out of non-yaoguai societies, and those who live among other societies in disguise. Yaoguai who keep to themselves might be solitary with a small number of associates who live a good distance away. Yaoguai of similar origins might share a domicile and consider themselves part of a found family, with the most senior member acting as the parental or older sibling figure. Some groups have more of a master-student or ruler-retainer dynamic, particularly if the leading yaoguai is significantly more powerful.

Yaoguai who dip in and out of other cultures are often tricksters who prank the communities they frequent. As bothersome and malicious activity draws attention, most yaoguai groups wisely keep their pranks helpful or tasteful to ensure their longevity. The pranks in such cases might consist of completing tasks or punching up at a local despot. Unfortunately, there are always powerful entities willing to sponsor yaoguai with evil intent, which such yaoguai take as permission to rob and attack settlements without abandon. These infamous stories are the reason why yaoguai bounty hunting is a booming industry in Tian Xia and why yaoguai who live in non-yaoguai communities go to extreme lengths to keep a low profile. Often, these yaoguai live by themselves, in pairs, or in trios at most, as they fear numbers might betray their safety.

Yaoguai who spontaneously come to be typically pick their own name, which might cheekily refer to their natural form. Other yaoguai gain a name by what others call them, often a nickname that stems from a specific ability, physical trait, or a particular event or action that made them known. These naming schemes can feel like a trap for many yaoguai, however, as it accentuates their yaoguai nature rather than their experience or personality. Being bestowed a name that is unrelated to being yaoguai, or is uniquely theirs, identifies them as an individual and is a considerable honor for many, even more than titles or wealth. For some, restoring a lost or disgraced name is the desired equivalent.

### Sample Names

"Lamplight" Deng (lamp), Geomi (spider), Mindeulle (dandelion), Qing Yeliu (green snake), Qiu Haitang (pogonia), Sekiko (stone)

## Beliefs

There's the misconception that yaoguai are wicked by nature, no matter their intent or actions. This is far from the truth, especially with regard to yaoguai who live among humanoid communities or seek to transcend their being. Most yaoguai can be as heroic as any other of Tian Xia's wandering adventurers. If a yaoguai came from an established yaoguai community, they might lean toward pragmatism, though there are also a few reckless tricksters. Yaoguai who spent much of their formative years by themselves or with a very small group of compatriots are often impulsive unless they follow a cultivation school or philosophy that demands otherwise. Some yaoguai are particularly susceptible to the influence of their environment and peers, meaning they change their opinions more easily and rapidly than other ancestries.

Various yaoguai enclaves revere Shizuru and Tsukiyo, as it's believed that the power of sunlight and moonlight grants most yaoguai their awakening. Qi Zhong is often cited and worshipped as the guiding teacher of the first yaoguai who ascended to divinity, Sun Wukong. Though Sun Wukong ascended through dubiously ethical methods, nearly all yaoguai know of his tales and exploits, even if the Monkey King isn't a particularly popular subject of worship.

**Popular Edicts**

discover your name, leave a good impression wherever you go, seek ways to cultivate your power and transcend your nature

**Popular Anathema**

accept the limitations placed upon you, defy the laws of your enclave, dismiss an opportunity for growth

## Yaoguai Mechanics

**Rarity** Rare

**Hit Points** 8

**Size** Medium

**Speed** 25 feet

**Attribute Boosts** Charisma, Constitution, Free

**Attribute Flaw** Intelligence

**Languages** Common, Additional languages equal to your Intelligence modifier (if it's positive). Choose from Aklo, Draconic, Elven, Fey, Kitsune, Naga, Sakvroth, Tengu, Ysoki, and any other languages to which you have access (such as the languages prevalent in your region).

**Traits** Humanoid, Yaoguai

**Change Shape** (concentrate, occult, polymorph, yaoguai) You transform to or from your true yaoguai form into a humanoid alternate form, which is a common Medium humanoid ancestry prevalent where you were born (typically human). This form is the same apparent age and body type as your yaoguai form and has roughly analogous physical traits, such as hair color. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the Impersonate use of Deception. You can remain in your humanoid form indefinitely, but you revert to your yaoguai form after 1 hour of unconsciousness or 1 minute after death.

## Yaoguai Heritages

Yaoguai literally come in all shapes. The entity you were before awakening as a yaoguai determines your origin. Choose one of the following yaoguai heritages at 1st level. You gain the benefits for a form only while in that form.

If you're a yaoguai with a versatile heritage, you still select a yaoguai heritage to inform your character's story, but you don't gain any of its mechanical effects. You can take the Awakened Yaoguai Heritage feat to gain these effects and qualify for feats that require a specific heritage.
