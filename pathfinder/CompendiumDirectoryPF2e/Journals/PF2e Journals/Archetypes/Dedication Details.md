# Dedication Details
Each archetype's dedication feat represents your character's dedicated effort learning a new set of abilities, making it impossible to split your focus and pursue another archetype at the same time. Once you take a dedication feat, you can't select a different dedication feat until you complete your dedication by taking two other feats from your current archetype. You can't retrain a dedication feat as long as you have any other feats from that archetype.
