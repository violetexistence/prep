# Ritualist
*   Uncommon

While some learn the art of ritual casting through rigorous study, other gifted individuals may find that a combination of natural talent and luck grants them surprising skill at performing rituals, whether they want that power or not. Undertaking rituals always carries an element of risk, but the potential rewards are undeniable and difficult to resist. You have learned how to perform rituals and can decide how to best use their powerful benefits.

## [[Feats/Ritualist Dedication|Ritualist Dedication]] Feat 4

**Prerequisites** expert in Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion

* * *

You have begun to master the difficult art of casting rituals. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to all checks to perform a ritual. You learn two uncommon rituals of 2nd rank or lower. You must meet all prerequisites to be the primary caster of a ritual to select it, and you can't teach it to anyone else or allow someone else to serve as primary caster unless they know the ritual as well.

At 8th level and every 4 levels thereafter, you learn two more rituals with the same restrictions and with a maximum rank of half that level.

## [[Feats/Flexible Ritualist|Flexible Ritualist]] Feat 6

*   archetype

You can perform two aspects of a ritual yourself. When you cast a ritual, you can reduce the number of secondary casters by 1. When you do, you must fulfill any requirements for the secondary caster, and you attempt the secondary check normally performed by that secondary caster. You can't replace a secondary caster who is the target of the spell (as in the [[Spells/Atone|Atone]] ritual).

## [[Feats/Resourceful Ritualist|Resourceful Ritualist]] Feat 6

*   archetype
*   skill

You can cast difficult rituals that might otherwise be just beyond your skill. You can attempt checks to cast a ritual that requires expert proficiency if you are trained, master proficiency if you are an expert, or legendary proficiency if you are a master.

## [[Feats/Efficient Rituals|Efficient Rituals]] Feat 8

*   archetype

You can perform particularly extensive rituals in less time. If the ritual normally requires 1 day to cast, you can cast it in 4 hours. If it takes longer than 1 day, you cast it in half the number of days, rounded up.

At 14th level, if a ritual has a casting time measured in days, you can cast it in an equal number of hours. If this results in a ritual longer than 8 hours, you split the ritual between multiple days, as normal for a ritual.

## [[Feats/Assured Ritualist|Assured Ritualist]] Feat 10

*   archetype

You can cover for a secondary caster's error. If you are the primary caster, after all the secondary checks are rolled, you can choose one check that was a failure or critical failure, and improve the result to one degree of success better than what the secondary caster rolled.

## [[Feats/Enterprising Ritualist|Enterprising Ritualist]] Feat 14

*   archetype

Elegant and expensive components are no replacement for your skill and practice at ritual casting. If a ritual has a Cost entry that has a value in gp, reduce the amount you need to spend by 10%. If you critically succeed at the primary check for a ritual, the gp value of components the ritual consumes is reduced by the same amount. For example, using resurrect to bring back a 14th-level creature normally costs 1,050 gp, but would cost you only 945 gp; and if you critically succeeded at the primary Religion check, you would spend only 840 gp.
