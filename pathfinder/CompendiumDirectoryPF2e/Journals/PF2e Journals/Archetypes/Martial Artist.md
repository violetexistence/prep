# Martial Artist
You have trained in the martial arts, making your unarmed strikes lethal. You seek neither mysticism nor enlightenment, and you don't view this training as some greater path to wisdom. Yours is the way of the fist striking flesh, the hand turning aside the blade, and the devastating kick taking your enemy down. Your training is focused and practical, and since you have turned every part of your body into a weapon, you never find yourself without one. While you might have learned your techniques in a dojo or school focused on training the body, you might just as easily have learned them in street brawls and bar fights, combining instincts with intense athleticism for a deadly combination.

Regardless of your origins, your path is one of iron, transforming your body into a deadly weapon. The techniques available are many, but the results are all the same. Whether you attack with your fist, fang, or foot, your prowess is undeniable. Many martial artists seek to master a stance to put form to their flurry of attacks. Such techniques allow one to channel their strength. However, some prefer freedom in form and reject stances altogether. You may find your own style or master one of the forms used by legendary martial artists.

*   Uncommon

## [[Feats/Follow-Up Strike|Follow-Up Strike]] Feat 6

*   archetype
*   flourish

**Requirements** Your last action was a missed Strike with a melee unarmed attack.

* * *

You have trained rigorously to use all parts of your body as a weapon, and when you miss with an attack, you can usually continue the attack with a different body part and still deal damage. Make another Strike with a melee unarmed attack, using the same multiple attack penalty as the missed Strike, if any.

## [[Feats/Thunder Clap|Thunder Clap]] Feat 6

*   archetype
*   sonic

You slam your hands together to unleash a deafening blast. Creatures in a 15-foot cone cone take 3d6 sonic damage, with a `Fortitude check` against your class DC. Creatures that critically fail their save are also [[Conditions/Deafened|Deafened]] for 1 minute. You can't use this ability again for 1d4 rounds as your hands recover from the thunderous vibrations.

At 8th level, and every 2 levels thereafter, the damage from Thunder Clap increases by 1d6.

## [[Feats/Adamantine Body|Adamantine Body]] Feat 8

*   archetype

**Trigger** An attack or effect would deal damage to you.

* * *

With your strong will and even stronger body, you shrug off an otherwise devastating blow. You gain resistance equal to 2 + half your level against all damage from the triggering attack or effect.

## [[Feats/Grievous Blow|Grievous Blow]] Feat 8

*   archetype
*   flourish

You know how to deliver focused, powerful blows that bypass your enemies' resistances. Make an unarmed melee Strike. If this Strike hits, it deals two additional weapon damage dice and ignores an amount of resistance to physical damage (or to a specific physical damage type) equal to your level. This Strike counts as two attacks when calculating your multiple attack penalty.

If you are at least 18th level, increase the additional damage to three weapon damage dice.

## [[Feats/Black Powder Flash|Black Powder Flash]] Feat 10

*   archetype
*   visual

**Requirements** You're in Powder Punch Stance.

* * *

You ignite a pinch of black powder in a foe's face. Choose an adjacent creature. It must attempt a `Fortitude check` save against your class DC.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature is [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] for 1 round.

**Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] for 1 round and dazzled for 1 minute. The creature can rub its eyes as an Interact action to end this blinded condition.

**Critical Failure** The creature is blinded for 1 round and dazzled for 1 hour.

## [[Feats/Path of Iron|Path of Iron]] Feat 14

*   archetype
*   flourish

**Frequency** once per minute

* * *

With a burst of effort and speed, you weave a nimble path through your many enemies, striking each in turn as you move past them. You Stride; this movement doesn't trigger reactions. You can attempt a melee Strike up to three times at any point during your movement, each against a different enemy. Each attack counts toward your multiple attack penalty, but your multiple attack penalty doesn't increase until you have made all your attacks.

## [[Feats/Echoing Violence|Echoing Violence]] Feat 18

*   archetype
*   death
*   incapacitation

**Frequency** once per minute

**Trigger** You critically succeed with an unarmed Strike against an opponent.

* * *

Your powerful attack causes damage that reverberates through your opponent's body, shaking muscle from bone. The creature takes 10d6 bludgeoning damage with a `Fortitude check` save against your class DC. If it critically fails, it immediately dies as your blow tears apart its body internally.
