# Aldori Duelist
*   Uncommon

You have sworn the Aldori swordpact and studied the art of Aldori dueling, a famed school of bladecraft that has been passed down for over a millennium from the teachings of Baron Sirian Aldori. The Aldori Academy, widely regarded as the region's finest war college, is the pride and joy of Restov. You're filled with pride and determined to challenge yourself at every opportunity. One day, you hope to demonstrate your skill at swordplay to become acknowledged as a true swordlord.

Aldori duelists have much in common with swashbucklers, and many Aldori duelists have the swashbuckler class or archetype. Much like a swashbuckler's daring deeds, classic Aldori duelist maneuvers are often showy feats intended to impress or intimidate.

Many feats in this section refer to being in a duel or dueling actions. For more information about duels and dueling actions, see the [[PF2e Journals/GM Screen/dueling subsystem|dueling subsystem]].

## [[Feats/Duelist's Form|Duelist's Form]] Feat 16

*   archetype
*   stance

**Requirements** You are wielding only an [[Equipment/Aldori Dueling Sword|Aldori Dueling Sword]] and have your other hand or hands free; you are not [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]].

* * *

Many assume that a duelist's habit of fighting with one hand behind their back or on their hip is an insult or self-restriction. This could not be further from the truth. Fighting with a single hand dictates mastery and heightens the duelist's focus by narrowing points of interest, allowing them to move and react to changing situations with unnatural speed. While in this stance, you are [[Conditions/Quickened|Quickened]]. You can use this extra action only to Step or use a single-action activity gained from the Aldori duelist archetype. If you use your free hand for anything, this stance ends. When this stance ends, you become fatigued until you rest for at least 10 minutes.

## [[Feats/Tempo Duelist|Tempo Duelist]] Feat 16

*   archetype

You move with an unpredictable tempo, shifting between unnervingly slow and rapid movements. You are [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] for 1 round. As the nature of this effect still leaves your location obvious, you can't use this concealment to [[Actions/Hide|Hide]] or [[Actions/Sneak|Sneak]].

If the Strike is successful, attempt a Dueling Lore check against the target's Will DC. On a success, the target becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]]. This is an emotion, fear, and mental effect.
