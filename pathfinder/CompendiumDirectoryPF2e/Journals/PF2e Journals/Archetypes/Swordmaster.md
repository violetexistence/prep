# Swordmaster
*   Uncommon

Though the ultimate goal of the Pathfinder society is to learn, knowledge cannot be spread if those who discover it fail to come back alive. The Master of Swords teaches recruits to survive, to defend other Pathfinders, and to defeat the Society's enemies. The swordmaster embodies these skills, focusing on practicality and ignoring ideals or methods that interfere with their ability to overcome any challenge.

## Pathfinder Society Archetypes

The following archetypes are uncommon, but are available to members of the Pathfinder Society. Qualifying characters with the archetype can select one of these dedication feats even if they have not gained three feats from the [[PF2e Journals/Archetypes/Pathfinder Agent|Pathfinder Agent]] archetype, and each of these archetypes' feats fulfills the [[Feats/Pathfinder Agent Dedication|Pathfinder Agent Dedication's]] special requirement despite not being from the Pathfinder agent archetype.
