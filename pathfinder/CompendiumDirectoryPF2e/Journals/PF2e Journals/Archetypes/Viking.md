# Viking
To go 'viking' is to raid by sea, and thus vikings have spread far and wide. Some have even settled in the very communities they once raided. Vikings traditionally travel in longboats; a score of these warriors might live aboard their ship for days at a time, sailing the seas (or, as they call it, the 'whale-road') to ambush coastal communities. Once they arrive at a settlement, they charge ashore, plundering all they can find and slaying anyone foolish enough to get in their way. The ferocity of viking raids is legendary.

**Additional Feats:** **4th** [[Feats/Reactive Shield|Reactive Shield]]; **6th** [[Feats/Shielded Stride|Shielded Stride]]; **10th** [[Feats/Quick Shield Block|Quick Shield Block]]

## [[Feats/Viking Dedication|Viking Dedication]] Feat 2

*   archetype
*   dedication

**Prerequisites** trained in Athletics

* * *

Vikings spend long periods of time at sea, only to leap from their boats at a moment's notice, charge through the surf, and take their enemies by storm. You gain the Additional Lore general feat for Sailing Lore and Warfare Lore.

When using your land Speed, you ignore difficult terrain from shallow water, such as in bogs or on beaches. In addition, if you roll a success on an Athletics check to Swim, you get a critical success instead.

## [[Feats/Hurling Charge|Hurling Charge]] Feat 4

*   archetype

You make a ranged Strike with a thrown weapon you already have in your hand, Stride, and then [[Actions/Interact|Interact]] to draw another weapon.

* * *

**Special** If you are [[Actions/Rage|Raging]], and end the Stride adjacent to an enemy, that enemy is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] against the next Strike you make against it with the weapon you drew before the end of your next turn.

## [[Feats/Viking Weapon Familiarity|Viking Weapon Familiarity]] Feat 4

*   archetype

From childhood, you have been exposed to traditional viking combat techniques, and you soon learned to handle axe, sword, and shield in battle. Now, you can raid proudly alongside your fellows. You gain the [[Feats/Shield Block|Shield Block]] reaction. Additionally, you have familiarity with the [[Equipment/Battle Axe|Battle Axe]], [[Equipment/Hatchet|Hatchet]], [[Equipment/Longsword|Longsword]], [[Equipment/Shield Boss|Shield Boss]], [[Equipment/Shield Spikes|Shield Spikes]], and [[Equipment/Shortsword|Shortsword]]â€”for the purposes of proficiency, you treat any of these weapons as simple weapons.

At 5th level, whenever you get a critical hit with one of these weapons, you get its critical specialization effect.

## [[Feats/Second Shield|Second Shield]] Feat 6

*   archetype

**Trigger** Your [[Feats/Shield Block|Shield Block]] causes your shield to break or be destroyed.

* * *

You're used to your shield breaking in the middle of battle, and you're prepared to use a backup or any convenient nearby object to defend yourself.

You can [[Actions/Interact|Interact]] to draw a shield on your person or an unattended shield within your reach. If there is an object within your reach that could serve as an improvised shield-for example, a table or chair-you can Interact to draw it with this feat. The GM determines if something can be used as an improvised shield.

Your new shield isn't raised until you use the [[Actions/Raise a Shield|Raise a Shield]] action, as normal.

## [[Feats/Into the Fray|Into the Fray]] Feat 8

*   archetype

**Requirements** You are wielding a one-handed melee weapon in one hand and a shield in another hand.

* * *

You charge into battle with shield-splintering fury. You [[Actions/Leap|Leap]], Stride, or Swim. Make two melee Strikes during this movement, one with your one-handed melee weapon and one with your shield or a weapon attached to the shield (like a shield boss or shield spikes). You can make these Strikes at any points during your movement, and each must target a different enemy. Both attacks count toward your multiple attack penalty, but don't increase your penalty until you have made both attacks.

## [[Feats/Viking Vindicator|Viking Vindicator]] Feat 8

*   Uncommon
*   archetype

You are one of the raiders eagerly planning to launch an assault by sea on the Whispering Tyrant's Isle of Terror. You gain the [[Feats/Sudden Charge|Sudden Charge]] fighter feat, though it's a viking feat for you instead. As normal when gaining an additional feat from an archetype feat, gaining Sudden Charge doesn't count toward fulfilling the special requirement for Viking Dedication. If you already had Sudden Charge, you can retrain it as part of gaining this feat. When you use Sudden Charge to Strike a target in shallow water, the target is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] against your Strike, as you use the water kicked up by your passage to camouflage your angle of attack. If you have [[Feats/Viking Weapon Familiarity|Viking Weapon Familiarity]] or Viking Weapon Specialist, add the bastard sword and rapier to the list of weapons in those feats.
