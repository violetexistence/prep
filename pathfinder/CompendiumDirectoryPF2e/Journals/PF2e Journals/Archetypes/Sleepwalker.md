# Sleepwalker
Many think of mental realms and mindscapes as rare and elaborate constructions, forgetting that everyone creates their own mental realm when they sleep, one where even the strangest occurrences seem perfectly normal. Anything is possible inside these dreamscapes, but few sapient creatures have the will and insight to take control and truly explore their unconscious mind.

Sleepwalkers dedicate themselves to unlocking the secrets of the sleeping mind, taking control of their dreams and walking through the slumbering vistas of others. Some are nefarious manipulators, whispering to the slumbering for personal gain. Others use their powers for good, seeking evildoers and those who corrupt dreams to nightmares. As their power grows, a sleepwalker's appearance gradually becomes slightly indistinct, as though they were blurred around the edges, and those who encounter them find it difficult to recall exact details about their appearance.

## [[Feats/Infiltrate Dream|Infiltrate Dream]] Feat 6

*   archetype
*   mental
*   occult

Entering a dream is as natural to you as stepping through a doorway. If you're adjacent to a sleeping creature, you can enter a lucid dreamlike state, a process taking 10 minutes, to mentally walk into their dreamscape. While in the target's dream, you witness its contents, plots, and emotional experiences as an observer, though nothing within the dream can perceive or interact with you. Your target becomes temporarily immune to Infiltrate Dream for 1 week. You can't enter the dreams of a creature that doesn't have a conscious mind or doesn't dream.

While within the dream, you can attempt an `Occultism check` check against the target's Will DC to interpret symbolism and learn information about a single topic. If the target has no knowledge of the topic, you learn they don't know about the topic unless your result is a critical failure.

* * *

**Critical Success** You learn a piece of information directly relevant to the topic unless the target would want to hide it. If so, you learn something related to the topic but not a direct answer.

**Success** You receive a hint or clue about the topic. This clue will not be inaccurate, but it's cryptic, vague, or may be understandable only with additional information.

**Critical Failure** The dreams mislead you, and you learn an erroneous piece of information.

## [[Feats/Vision of Foresight|Vision of Foresight]] Feat 6

*   archetype
*   fortune
*   occult

**Requirements** You're in a Daydream Trance

* * *

You use your daydreams to predict the success of actions, rapidly envisioning the possibilities. Once before the end of your next turn, you can call upon these predictions before you roll a saving throw or skill check. You can roll the saving throw or skill check twice and take the better result.

## [[Feats/Dream Magic|Dream Magic]] Feat 8

*   archetype

You learn dream-related magic to aid your studies. Choose [[Spells/Dream Message|Dream Message]] or [[Spells/Sleep|Sleep]] upon taking this feat; you learn this spell as a 4th-rank innate occult spell. If you choose sleep, you can cast the spell only while in a Daydream Trance. You become trained in occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs, and your spellcasting ability for these spells is Wisdom.

* * *

**Special** You can take this feat twice, gaining the spell you didn't select initially the second time.

## [[Feats/Waking Dream|Waking Dream]] Feat 8

*   archetype

While in your trance, you can blur the line between dreams and reality for others. You gain the [[Spells/Waking Dream|Waking Dream]] focus spell, which you can use only while you're in a Daydream Trance. You gain a pool of Focus Points with 1 Focus Point and you can Refocus by taking a nap for 10 minutes. You become trained in occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs, and your spellcasting ability for these spells is Wisdom.

## [[Feats/Oneiric Influence|Oneiric Influence]] Feat 12

*   archetype
*   incapacitation
*   mental
*   occult

While Infiltrating a Dream, you can also implant a suggestion in the target's mind. The target must attempt a `Will check` save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher, to resist your modification, which has the effects of a [[Spells/Subconscious Suggestion|Subconscious Suggestion]] spell, but even on a critical success, the target doesn't realize you were trying to control them and may not recognize your presence in the dream. The suggestion remains in the target's subconscious for 1 week or until triggered. Their memories of carrying out the suggestion are hazy and dreamlike and they may not remember doing it unless later reminded.

## [[Feats/Ward Slumber|Ward Slumber]] Feat 12

*   archetype
*   occult

Just before going to sleep, you can perform a 10-minute ward to protect the slumber of up to eight creatures within 30 feet of you. All creatures affected by the ritual gain a +4 status bonus on saving throws against [[Spells/Nightmare|Nightmare]], a night hag's dream haunting, or other effects influencing dreams (such as those provided by this archetype) until your next daily preparations. They heal double the usual amount of Hit Points from resting.

## [[Feats/Dream Logic|Dream Logic]] Feat 14

*   archetype
*   mental
*   occult

You can transmit a sense of dreamy nonchalance. If you do something especially strange or dangerous while you're in your Daydream Trance, such as entering a restricted area or fighting someone in the street, any creature that isn't one of your allies must attempt a `Perception check` check against your class or spell DC (whichever is higher). On a success, it realizes something is amiss, and on a failure, it believes nothing is out of the ordinary. The creature can attempt a new check if you start doing something else strange, but not if you continue on the same course of action it already failed to notice was peculiar.

Any hostile action by you or your allies against an affected creature automatically ends the effect for that creature. The GM might allow the creature a new check if someone else brings your actions to its attention, such as if someone you're attacking calls out for help. When your trance ends, affected creatures retain their memories of events but likely still view them as unremarkable; unless they are prompted to relate the events, they might not report them.

## [[Feats/Shared Dream|Shared Dream]] Feat 16

*   archetype

You've learned to create a shared dreamscape to communicate with others. You can cast [[Spells/Dream Council|Dream Council]] as an innate occult spell.

## [[Feats/Ever Dreaming|Ever Dreaming]] Feat 18

*   archetype

You draw no distinction between the sleeping and waking worlds. Your Daydream Trance has an unlimited duration, and you no longer need to take an action to enter it. If you're [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]] due to sleep, you don't take the -4 penalty to AC, Perception, and Reflex saves, and don't have the [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] condition. You're still [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] while asleep. You can act on your turn while asleep, though you're [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 2]] until you fully awaken.
