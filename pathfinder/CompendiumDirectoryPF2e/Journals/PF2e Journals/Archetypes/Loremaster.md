# Loremaster
Knowledge is power, and you labor in pursuit of that power. No matter the situation, you can usually procure some tidbit of knowledge to inform your actions. You specialize in secrets, both uncovering them and hiding them away, and your command of the written word borders on the supernatural. As you discover deeper secrets of lore, you might develop a power over knowledge that becomes outright magical, allowing you to understand and disguise information even more effectively.

**Additional Feats:** **4th** [[Feats/Loremaster's Etude|Loremaster's Etude]]; **8th** [[Feats/Assured Knowledge|Assured Knowledge]]; **14th** [[Feats/Enigma's Knowledge|Enigma's Knowledge]]; **16th** [[Feats/True Hypercognition|True Hypercognition]]

## [[Feats/Loremaster Dedication|Loremaster Dedication]] Feat 2

*   archetype
*   dedication

**Prerequisites** trained in at least one skill to Decipher Writing

* * *

You've compiled a vast repository of information that touches on nearly every subject. You are trained in Loremaster Lore, a special Lore skill that can be used only to [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]], but on any topic.

If you have legendary proficiency in a skill used to [[Actions/Decipher Writing|Decipher Writing]], you gain expert proficiency in Loremaster Lore, but you can't increase your proficiency rank in Loremaster Lore by any other means.

You can take feats in the loremaster's additional feats entry even if you don't meet the [[Class Features/Enigma|enigma muse]] prerequisite.

If you have the [[Feats/Bardic Lore|Bardic Lore]] class feat, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to skill checks with Bardic Lore.

## [[Feats/Quick Study|Quick Study]] Feat 4

*   archetype

During your daily preparations, you can study a particular subject to gain the trained proficiency rank in one Lore skill of your choice. You must have interacted with that subject in some way on the previous day, whether by reading about it, talking to someone knowledgeable on the topic, or experiencing it yourself.

Alternatively, you can reference your notes to instead choose a Lore skill you've prepared before with Quick Study. This proficiency lasts until you prepare again. Since this proficiency is temporary, you can't use it as a prerequisite for a skill increase or a permanent character option like a feat.

## [[Feats/Greater Magical Edification|Greater Magical Edification]] Feat 10

*   archetype

You've continued to expand your compendium of tools to compile knowledge. You can cast [[Spells/Translate|Translate]], [[Spells/Mindlink|Mindlink]], and [[Spells/Secret Page|Secret Page]] as innate occult spells, each once per day. When you cast _secret page_, it is automatically heightened to the same spell rank as your cantrips from Magical Edification.
