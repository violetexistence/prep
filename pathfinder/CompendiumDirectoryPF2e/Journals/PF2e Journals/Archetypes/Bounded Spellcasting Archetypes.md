# Bounded Spellcasting Archetypes
Some archetypes, such as the magus and summoner multiclass archetypes, grant you spellcasting abilities based on the way magi and summoners cast spells, albeit delayed compared to a character from those classes. In this book, both archetypes are bounded spellcasting archetypes, but future books might introduce bounded spellcasting archetypes that aren't multiclass archetypes. A bounded spellcasting archetype allows you to use scrolls, staves, and wands in the same way that a member of a spellcasting class can, and the basic bounded spellcasting feat counts as having a spellcasting class feature.

Bounded spellcasting archetypes always have a basic bounded spellcasting feat, an expert bounded spellcasting feat, and a master bounded spellcasting feat. These feats share their name with the archetype. For instance, the magus's master spellcasting feat is called Master Magus Spellcasting. All spell slots you gain from bounded spellcasting archetypes have restrictions depending on the archetype. For example, the summoner archetype grants you spell slots you can use only to cast spells from your summoner repertoire, even if you are a sorcerer with spells of the same tradition in your sorcerer repertoire.

## Basic Bounded Spellcasting Feat

Usually gained at 6th level, these feats give you a 1st-rank spell slot and a 2nd-rank spell slot from that magical tradition. If you have a spell repertoire, you can select one spell from your repertoire as a signature spell. Archetypes refer to these benefits as the "basic bounded spellcasting benefits." At 10th level, you replace your 1st-rank spell slot with a 3rd-rank spell slot.

## Expert Bounded Spellcasting Feat

Usually taken at 12th level, these feats make you an expert in spell attack rolls and DCs of the appropriate magical tradition. You gain an additional 3rd-rank spell slot. If you have a spell repertoire, you can select a second spell from your repertoire as a signature spell. At 14th level, you replace your spell slots with two 4th-rank spell slots and one 5th-rank spell slot, and at 16th level, you replace your spell slots with two 5th-rank spell slots and one 6th-rank spell slot. Archetypes refer to these benefits as the "expert bounded spellcasting benefits."

## Master Bounded Spellcasting Feat

Usually taken at 18th level, these feats make you a master in spell attack rolls and DCs of the appropriate magical tradition and grant you an additional 6th-rank spell slot. At 20th level, they replace your two 5th-rank spell slots with two 7th-rank spell slots. Archetypes refer to these benefits as the "master bounded spellcasting benefits."
