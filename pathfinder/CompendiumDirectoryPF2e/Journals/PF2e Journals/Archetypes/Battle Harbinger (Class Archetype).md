# Battle Harbinger (Class Archetype)
Battle harbingers are elite, specially trained members of their faith, usually carrying out missions that require extra martial prowess. Built for the battlefield and used to working alongside other warriors, as well as tackling dangerous solo operations, battle harbingers typically spend more time training outside their temples than praying within them. What they lack in spellcasting prowess they make up for with expertise in weaponry and defense.

Even less combat-oriented faiths understand that battle harbingers can be a necessity, especially if there's a dangerous quest that must be undertaken alone. Because battle harbingers rigorously train their bodies to withstand hardship, they tend to have more capability to support themselves, leaving more traditional priests to handle group-wide supportive magic and prayers.

Battle harbingers specialize in bolstering themselves with their deity's power and weakening their opponents in the same vein.

A battle harbinger's training varies greatly from that of a typical cleric. While this training initially resembles that of a warpriest cleric, the martial and spellcasting philosophies of a battle harbinger soon differ. A battle harbinger is taught to rely less on their spells, instead focusing on a select array of spells to supplement their combat abilities. Their main magical abilities focus on battle auras, spells that create areas centered on the battle harbinger that either empower their allies or hamper their foes. Battle harbingers are generally expected to take the fight directly to a foe, and their auras supplement these tactics.

The main component of a battle harbinger's training involves their battle creed. While a battle creed varies from faith to faith, the core aspects of these creeds remain the same regardless of dogma. A battle creed declares a battle harbinger to be a living weapon for their god or faith. The battle harbinger is expected to enter combat on behalf of their god and to adhere to strict training regimens that support this goal. Battle harbingers train to make use of powerful armor and their god's favored weapon. Supplemental training focuses on the body, allowing battle harbingers to stave off fatigue and dangers that target one's health directly. Some battle harbingers, such as those who follow Erastil, prefer to make use of ranged tactics, but they still learn more direct combat should the need arise.

Although a battle harbinger's spellcasting capabilities are more limited than their fellow clerics, their magic generally isn't less potent. Battle harbingers are still capable of calling down strong divine power, but they rely on this magic less often than their brethren. This is mostly due to their martial training, which focuses on their bodies, combat, and defense. As such, a battle harbinger doesn't carry as much magic potential as other clerics. The exception to this is their training in battle auras, which many battle harbingers are able to make greater use of as their prowess grows.

While most battle harbingers are associated with a given temple, it's not unusual for one to be a lone mercenary, enacting their deity's will along their travels and through their contract work.

## [[Class Features/Battle Creed|Battle Creed]]1st

*   cleric

You've undergone a special training to focus your body toward combat. While you still adhere to the teachings of your faith, you also know that you serve as an instrument of your church. More so than any warpriest, the physical rigors that come with battle are key to your training. You've dedicated yourself to the battle creed, a specific approach that puts combat prowess first, even at the expense of a cleric's typical spellcasting and restorative abilities. Defeating one's enemies is more important than healing an ally in the heat of battle; the time for healing comes after. As you abide by the battle creed, your physical and martial capabilities grow stronger. You must select [[Feats/Battle Harbinger Dedication|Battle Harbinger Dedication]] as your 2nd- level class feat.

**Prerequisites:**

*   You must be a cleric.
    
*   You don't gain the [[Class Features/Resolute Faith|Resolute Faith]] class feature.
    
*   You don't gain the [[Class Features/Miraculous Spell|Miraculous Spell]] class feature.
    

**Spellcasting Adjustment**: Your spellcasting capabilities are more restricted. At 1st level, you can prepare one 1st-rank spell and five cantrips. As you increase in level, your number of spell slots and the highest rank of spells you can cast from spell slots increases, shown in Battle Harbinger Spells per Day. Because of your focus on your physical training at the expense of magical aptitude, you have no more than two spell slots of your highest rank and, if you can cast 2nd-rank spells or higher, two spell slots of 1 rank lower than your highest spell rank. For anything that requires the ability to cast spells of a certain rank that's lower than the highest slots you have, you still qualify even if you no longer have spell slots at those ranks.

**Divine Font Adjustment:** Instead of preparing [[Spells/Heal|Heal]] or [[Spells/Harm|Harm]] spells with your divine font, you instead gain the battle font, which allows you to prepare battle aura spells. You gain 4 additional spell slots each day at your highest rank of cleric spell slots. You can prepare only [[Spells/Bane|Bane]] or [[Spells/Bless|Bless]] in these slots. Any feats and effects that refer to a battle aura refers to these spells, regardless of whether they were cast with your standard spell slots or your divine font spell slots. At 5th level, the number of additional slots increases to 5, and at 15th level, the total number of additional slots increases to 6. Your battle auras use your class DC instead of your spell DC.
