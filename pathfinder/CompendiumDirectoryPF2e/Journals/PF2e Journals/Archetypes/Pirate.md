# Pirate
You live a life of freedom, taking by force and intimidation all that you could possibly desire. You may be a privateer, raiding and plundering on behalf of a particular nation or another authority, or you may answer to no one but your own capricious whims. Either way, you rely on intimidation, wits, and combat prowess to take what you want from those you deem less deserving.

Pirates have much in common with swashbucklers, and many pirates have the swashbuckler class or archetype. Much like a swashbuckler's daring deeds, classic pirate maneuvers are often showy feats intended to impress, intimidate, and gain panache. For example, if you have the panache class feature, Boarding Assault gains the bravado trait.

**Additional Feats:** **4th** [[Feats/Antagonize|Antagonize]], [[Feats/You're Next|You're Next]]

As a pirate, you sail the seas in search of enemy ships to plunder and great adventures to embark on. You gain the [[Feats/Additional Lore|Additional Lore]] general feat for Sailing Lore or for a specific coastal city you have a connection to (such as Port Peril Lore). You ignore the effects of difficult terrain or uneven ground caused by unstable ground (such as the deck of a ship). Additionally, you gain the [[Actions/Boarding Assault|Boarding Assault]] action.

## [[Feats/Broadside Buckos|Broadside Buckos]] Feat 4

*   Uncommon
*   archetype

Shimali Manux trains every Salt Breaker to fight in the cramped quarters below deck, and you've learned how to use these techniques with your crew. During your daily preparations, you can name up to five crewmates you will be working with that day. If an enemy is within reach of you and at least two of your crewmates, that enemy is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] against you.

## [[Feats/Pirate Combat Training|Pirate Combat Training]] Feat 4

*   archetype

You're particularly skilled at wielding the weapons used traditionally by pirates. You gain either the [[Feats/Combat Climber|Combat Climber]] or [[Feats/Underwater Marauder|Underwater Marauder]] skill feat, even if you do not meet its prerequisites. You have familiarity with the following weapons: [[Equipment/Hatchet|Hatchet]], [[Equipment/Rapier|Rapier]], [[Equipment/Scimitar|Scimitar]], and [[Equipment/Whip|Whip]]—for the purposes of proficiency, you treat any of these weapons as simple weapons. Your GM may add additional martial weapons to this list as appropriate for your world or region.

At 5th level, whenever you get a critical hit with one of these weapons, you get its critical specialization effect.

## [[Feats/Rope Runner|Rope Runner]] Feat 4

*   archetype
*   skill

You run and climb across ropes and rigging almost as easily as on the ground. You gain a climb Speed of 15 feet, but only when climbing ropes and similar objects. Whenever you succeed at an Athletics check to Climb or an Acrobatics check to [[Actions/Balance|Balance]], you get a critical success instead. You aren't [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] while Climbing or Balancing on a rope or similar object.

## [[Feats/Cutting Flattery|Cutting Flattery]] Feat 5

*   Uncommon
*   archetype
*   skill

Repeated entries in Firebrand bragging and flyting contests have taught you how to twist pretty words into concealed insults. When you succeed at your check to [[Actions/Coerce|Coerce]] a creature, the target's attitude toward you improves by one step, to a maximum of friendly, and they don't become unfriendly 1 day later.

## [[Feats/Watch This!|Watch This!]] Feat 6

*   Uncommon
*   archetype
*   auditory
*   emotion

**Trigger** An ally misses or critically misses an enemy you can see with their attack.

* * *

A common saying among Firebrands is, "There's always a fool who thinks they can do it better—and they're often right." You verbally commit to using an action on your next turn to make a melee Strike against the same enemy your ally has missed. If your attack hits, you deal additional damage equal to twice the number of damage dice.

## [[Feats/Walk the Plank|Walk the Plank]] Feat 8

*   archetype

You frighten a foe into moving where you want them, traditionally demanding they walk the plank.

Attempt to [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] an opponent. On a success, in addition to the normal effects, you can also force the target to Stride up to its Speed immediately. You choose the path the target takes, but you can't force it to move into an obviously harmful space (such as into hazardous terrain or a space where it would fall) unless your check was a critical success. As normal for forced movement, this movement doesn't trigger reactions.

The target then becomes temporarily immune to Walk the Plank for 10 minutes.

## [[Feats/Hook 'Em|Hook 'Em]] Feat 10

*   Uncommon
*   archetype
*   flourish

**Requirements** A rope is within your reach, or you have a rope or grappling weapon in your hand.

* * *

The Salt Breakers learned to use whatever they could during the Vidric Revolution, and they quickly mastered the art of making a rope into a useful tool in combat. You take hold of a nearby rope, throw a rope from your hand, or fire a grappling weapon at a solid surface—and then swing up to twice your Speed. If you end your movement next to an enemy, attempt an Athletics check to [[Actions/Grapple|Grapple]] that enemy, tying them up in your rope.
