# Eagle Knight
*   Uncommon

When most people around the Inner Sea think of Andoran, the first thing they picture is an Eagle Knight, resplendent in blue and silver armor. Ever since the People's Revolt, the order has existed to safeguard the core principles of Andoran: equality, justice, and liberty. These knights are recognized for their loyalty to the ideals of the nation above all else, including personal ambition or service to a commanding officer. Most Eagle Knights serve a specific branch—the home guard of the Golden Legion, the evangelical Steel Falcons, or the clandestine Twilight Talons—but all Eagle Knights dedicate themselves to the stability and integrity of Andoran. Their newest cohort, the Platinum Wing, is experimenting with firearms.

## [[Feats/Commitment to Equality|Commitment to Equality]] Feat 4

*   archetype
*   auditory
*   mental
*   skill

You help an ally shake off any impediment that would give an enemy an unfair advantage. You rally a creature within 30 feet in an attempt to reduce its [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened]] or [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied]] condition. If a creature has multiple conditions from this list, choose one. When you're a master in Diplomacy, add [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy]] and [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled]] to the list of conditions. When you're legendary in Diplomacy, add [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned]] to the list of conditions; if the stunned condition has a duration instead of a value, you can't use Commitment to Equality to reduce it.

Attempt a `Diplomacy check` check against the saving throw DC of the effect that caused the condition; if there was no saving throw DC, use the hard DC for the level of the creature, hazard, or item that caused the effect. You can't treat a condition that came from an artifact or effect above 20th level unless you're legendary in Diplomacy; even if you can, the counteract DC increases by 10. You can't treat a condition that is part of a curse or disease or is a natural state of the target. Once you attempt to treat a target's condition, that target is immune to further attempts for 1 hour, regardless of the result.

* * *

**Critical Success** Reduce the condition's value by 2.

**Success** Reduce the condition's value by 1.

**Critical Failure** Increase the condition's value by 1.
