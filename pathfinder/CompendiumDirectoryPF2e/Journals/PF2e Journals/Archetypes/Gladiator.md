# Gladiator
The roar of the crowd and thrill of competitive combat drive you to become the bestâ€”and the fame isn't bad either. You always do your best work under the fervent gaze of spectators, and by work, you of course mean violence.

## [[Feats/Gladiator Dedication|Gladiator Dedication]] Feat 2

*   archetype
*   dedication

**Prerequisites** Impressive Performance

* * *

You know how to turn combat into a form of entertainment. You gain the Additional Lore general feat for Gladiatorial Lore. If you were already trained in Gladiatorial Lore, you also become trained in a Lore skill of your choice.

At the start of a combat encounter, if you have spectators, you gain a number of temporary HP equal to your character level for 1 minute and you can roll Performance for your initiative. If there are sapient creatures observing a combat encounter, and these onlookers are neither engaged in the combat themselves nor directly assisting any participants, the combatants have spectators. The GM is the final arbiter of whether or not a combat has spectators.

*   archetype
*   skill

You show off your fighting style to discourage your foes. You can use Performance to [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]].

## [[Feats/Play to the Crowd|Play to the Crowd]] Feat 4

*   archetype
*   concentrate

**Trigger** You reduce an enemy to 0 Hit Points during a non-trivial combat encounter with spectators.

* * *

You show off for the crowd. Attempt a `Performance check` check; the DC is determined by the GM but is typically the standard DC for your level or the DC to [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] on the spectators, whichever is higher. On a success, choose one of the following benefits; on a critical success, choose two benefits:

*   A number of temporary Hit Points equal to your character level; these last for 1 minute.
    
    [[Feat_Feature Effects/Effect_ Play to the Crowd (Temporary Hit Points)|Effect: Play to the Crowd (Temporary Hit Points)]]
    
*   A +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the end of your next turn.
    
    [[Feat_Feature Effects/Effect_ Play to the Crowd (AC Bonus)|Effect: Play to the Crowd (AC Bonus)]]
    
*   A +1 circumstance bonus to your next attack roll before the end of your next turn.

## [[Feats/Stage Fighting|Stage Fighting]] Feat 4

## [[Feats/Performative Weapons Training|Performative Weapons Training]] Feat 6

*   archetype

You're skilled with flashy weapons and can use them to great effect. You have familiarity with the [[Equipment/Bo Staff|Bo Staff]], [[Equipment/Dueling Cape|Dueling Cape]], [[Equipment/Spiked Chain|Spiked Chain]], [[Equipment/Sword Cane|Sword Cane]], [[Equipment/Trident|Trident]], [[Equipment/War Flail|War Flail]], and [[Equipment/Whip|Whip]]. For the purposes of proficiency, you treat these as simple weapons. The GM may add other martial weapons to this list as appropriate for the world or region you are playing in.

Whenever you get a critical hit with one of these weapons, you get its critical specialization effect.

## [[Feats/Call Your Shot|Call Your Shot]] Feat 8

*   archetype

When you successfully Play to the Crowd, add the following to the list of benefits you can choose from:

*   Choose a creature within 30 feet that can see you to become [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]]. This effect has the emotion, fear, mental, and visual traits.

## [[Feats/Living for the Applause|Living for the Applause]] Feat 8

*   Uncommon
*   archetype

**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** You would be reduced to 0 Hit Points (but not immediately killed) during a combat encounter that has spectators.

* * *

Nothing can stop you as long as you have an audience cheering you on. The attention reinvigorates you and keeps you from being knocked out. You remain at 1 Hit Point, and your [[Conditions/Wounded|Wounded]] condition increases by 1.

In addition, attempt a `Performance check` check; the DC is determined by the GM but is typically the standard DC for your level or the DC to [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] on the spectators, whichever is higher. On a success, the crowd erupts in applause and cheers at your comeback, much to the dismay of your enemies. Concern for the crowd's reaction should your opponent deliver a finishing blow gives you a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the end of your next turn. On a critical success, you don't expend your daily use of Living for the Applause and can use the reaction an additional time on the same day.

## [[Feats/Big Debut|Big Debut]] Feat 10

*   Uncommon
*   archetype
*   mental

**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** You're about to roll initiative.

* * *

Now's your chance! You're a Firebrand, and the world must know it. You strike a dramatic pose, deliver a snappy quip, or reveal a shocking new costume, captivating everyone who can see you. You don't roll initiative. Instead, you voluntarily go last. Enemies who can see you must attempt a `Will check` saving throw against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. On a failure, the enemy is overcome with anticipation for what you'll do next on the battlefield and becomes [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]] ([[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 2]] on a critical failure). As your first action on your first turn, you can Interact to draw or stow an item of light Bulk as a free action; if this item is a small garment or accessory, such as a fan, a pair of gloves, or a wine glass, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus on Charisma-based skill checks until the end of your turn.

## [[Feats/Gladiator's Roar|Gladiator's Roar]] Feat 12

*   Uncommon
*   archetype
*   emotion
*   fear
*   mental
*   sonic

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

You can project your voice into a high-pitched screech that damages your foes. Your roar can be heard twice as far as normal, and creatures within a 15-foot cone take 6d10 sonic damage and must attempt a `Fortitude check` save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. If your Gladiator's Roar triggers Play to the Crowd, you gain a +2 status bonus to your Performance check to do so.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature takes half damage and becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]]

**Failure** The creature takes full damage and becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]].

**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage, becomes [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 3]], and is [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]].
