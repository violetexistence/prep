# Special Archetypes
Some archetype feats have the skill trait, allowing you to take them in place of a skill feat rather than a class feat. A skill feat still counts to satisfy the requirement of the dedication. Other books contain class archetypes that can modify your class's abilities as soon as 1st level. You can never have more than one class archetype.
