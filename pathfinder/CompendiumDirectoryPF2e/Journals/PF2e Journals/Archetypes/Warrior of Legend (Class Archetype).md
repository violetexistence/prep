# Warrior of Legend (Class Archetype)
It is said that the greatest heroes are often stalked by an implacable doom, the shadow cast by the light of their deeds. Such warriors of legend often garner great reputations for their prowess and ferocity in battle, spawning legends of their invincibility. These stories almost always end in tragedy, however, for the blessings that carry the warriors to victory are always accompanied by a terrible curse that all but ensures their heroic tales have grim endings.

Since the Godsrain scattered divine power across Golarion, more and more tales of such legendary warriors have sprung up all over the world, from Garund to Tian Xia, Casmaron to Arcadia, and across Avistan all the way to the Crown of the World. Hallmarks of these stories include heroes and villains who prefer lighter armor, hafted weapons, and who all seem to have an aversion or vulnerability to certain types of opponents.

The would-be ruler Gulrik the Fierce slew a linnorm in the depths of the Grungir Forest but was slain by the arrows of lowly bandits before he could claim a kingdom for himself. The warrior Mohaadjii had just begun to forge a legend by driving pillagers from Bloodcove out of the Kaava Lands, when a slingstone from a halfling raider struck her dead before she even realized she was under attack.

This cursed weakness perhaps goes a long way to explaining why certain pieces of gear are so common to the figures at the center of these stories. With each warrior of legend living under the shadow of finding their doom at the hands of a particular threat, even such staunch stalwarts might prefer a weapon that gives them enough reach to assess their opponent before closing in for the kill, and armor light enough that it won't become a burden if flight becomes the better part of valor.

## [[Class Features/Warrior of Legend|Warrior of Legend]] 1st

*   fighter

You have received a blessing that will ensure your ascension to legend, and a curse that foretells your inevitable fall. You must select Warrior of Legend Dedication as your 2nd-level class feat.

**Prerequisites:** You must be a fighter.

**Warrior of Legend Adjustments:** You aren't trained in heavy armor.

The armor expertise and armor mastery class features only improve your proficiency rank for light armor, medium armor, and unarmored defense. You don't gain Shield Block as a class feature. You are trained in both Acrobatics and Athletics, rather than one or the other.

Choose one physical damage type, which becomes your cursed weakness: bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing. You gain weakness to this damage type equal to half your level (minimum 1).

You gain [[Feats/Diehard|Diehard]] as a bonus feat, but you become [[Conditions/Doomed|Doomed 2]] whenever you take damage from your cursed weakness (unless your doomed value is already higher).

Your fighter weapon mastery and weapon legend class features grant you increased proficiency in both spears and polearms, but you can't choose any other weapon group with these class features.

You have received a blessing that will ensure your ascension to legend, and a curse that foretells your inevitable fall. You must select Warrior of Legend Dedication as your 2nd-level class feat.

You have been given a powerful blessing of battle that is also your cursed doom. As long as you aren't wearing heavy armor or wielding a shield, spears and polearms you wield gain the parry trait. If the weapon already has the parry trait, increase the bonus when parrying to +2. In addition, you deal an additional amount of damage equal to your [[Conditions/Doomed|Doomed]] value with weapons in the spear and polearm groups. This damage is the same type as the required weapon.
