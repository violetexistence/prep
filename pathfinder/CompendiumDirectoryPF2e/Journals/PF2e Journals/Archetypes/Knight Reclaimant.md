# Knight Reclaimant
*   Uncommon

Knights reclaimant spend much of their time amid the horrors of the Gravelands, rescuing civilians that remain and striking back against the Whispering Tyrant's agents. Accomplishing these goals requires the adoption of subtle tactics, with a focus on stealth and survival.

## Knights of Lastwall Archetypes

The following archetypes are uncommon but are available to members of the Knights of Lastwall. Qualifying characters with the Lastwall sentry archetype can select one of these dedications even without gaining three feats from the Lastwall sentry archetype, and each of these archetypes' feats fulfills the [[Feats/Lastwall Sentry Dedication|Lastwall Sentry Dedication]]'s special requirement despite not being from the Lastwall sentry archetype.

## [[Feats/Knight Reclaimant Dedication|Knight Reclaimant Dedication]] Feat 6

*   Uncommon
*   archetype
*   dedication

**Prerequisites** trained in Survival, trained in Stealth, any non-evil alignment, member of the Knights of Lastwall of knight rank

* * *

You have sworn the Crimson Oath and become a full member of the Crimson Reclaimers. You gain expert proficiency in Stealth and Survival. Whenever you roll a success on a saving throw against an undead's special ability, you get a critical success instead. This applies to any abilities that come from being undead, including an undead's innate spells (but not its prepared or spontaneous spells).

## [[Feats/Ashen Veil|Ashen Veil]] Feat 7

*   archetype
*   manipulate
*   skill

By smearing ash or tainted earth over your skin and armor, you shroud yourself from the dead. You become [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] to undead using vision or lifesense, allowing you to Hide and [[Actions/Sneak|Sneak]] without other sources of cover or concealment. This effect lasts only as long as you continue to take no actions other than to Hide, Sneak, or other surreptitious actions. The GM determines which actions end the effect, but attacking, casting spells, activating items, and the like always do.

## [[Feats/Voice Cold as Death|Voice Cold as Death]] Feat 7

*   archetype
*   auditory
*   concentrate
*   emotion
*   fear
*   mental
*   skill

**Requirements** You are not [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]].

* * *

Channeling the energy of the Crimson Oath into your voice, you pronounce a threat in a tone so icy it freezes the blood. Attempt an Intimidation check to [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]]; you don't suffer a penalty if the target doesn't understand the language you're speaking, but this otherwise functions as normal. You can't use Intimidating Glare or any other effect that would cause your Demoralize attempt to lose the auditory trait as part of using this feat. If you critically succeed at your Intimidation check, the target becomes [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]], or [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 2]] if the target is undead. After using this feat, you are fatigued until the end of your next turn, and you can't use this feat again until the end of your next turn.

## [[Feats/The Tyrant Falls!|The Tyrant Falls!]] Feat 20

*   archetype

You've reached the apex of the Crimson Oath's power. The oath's power is overwhelming—too much for a mortal frame—but victory is worth any price. When you use this feat, you cry out the final line of the Crimson Oath, unleashing unbridled power for 1 minute. You can Dismiss this effect. While this effect is active, you gain the following effects:

*   At the beginning of each of your turns, you become [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]] or increase the value of your drained condition by 1 if you are already drained. You can't reduce the value of your drained condition or remove it while The Tyrant Falls! is active. While The Tyrant Falls! is active, your drained condition does not penalize your Fortitude save.
*   You can cast [[Spells/Invoke the Crimson Oath|Invoke the Crimson Oath]] at will without expending Focus Points. When you do, increase the area to a 40-foot cone.
*   You gain resistance to all damage equal to half your character level.
*   Any melee weapon you wield gains the reach trait if it didn't already possess it, or increases its reach by 5 feet if it already has the reach trait. Your Strikes with that weapon deal an extra 2d6 vitality or void damage (whichever is more effective against the target).
