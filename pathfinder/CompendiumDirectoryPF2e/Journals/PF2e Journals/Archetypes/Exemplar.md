# Exemplar
*   Rare

You have awakened a tiny spark of divinity within yourself, either through your deeds or through exposure to a source of divine power. As you nurture this spark, you can become a potent divine combatant.

## [[Feats/Exemplar Dedication|Exemplar Dedication]] Feat 2

*   Rare
*   archetype
*   dedication
*   multiclass

**Prerequisites** Strength +2 or Dexterity +2

* * *

A spark of inherent divine power has lit itself within you. You become trained in martial weapons. You gain one ikon, the ability to use the ikon's immanence and transcendence actions and effects, and the [[Actions/Shift Immanence|Shift Immanence]] action. Because you have only a single ikon, when you Spark Transcendence, your divine spark recedes back to the depths of your soul and must be recalled with Shift Immanence to re-empower your ikon. You become trained in exemplar class DC.
