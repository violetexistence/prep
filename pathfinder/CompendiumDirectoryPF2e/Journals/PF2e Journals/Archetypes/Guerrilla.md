# Guerrilla
Eschewing straightforward clashes of armies on the fields of war, you favor covert, hit-and-run techniques that make your environment your battlefield. You specialize in using your surroundings to your advantage, striking from the shadows and disappearing before your foes realize what hit them.

**Additional Feats:** **4th** [[Feats/Blowgun Poisoner|Blowgun Poisoner]]

## [[Feats/Guerrilla Dedication|Guerrilla Dedication]] Feat 2

*   archetype
*   dedication

**Prerequisites** trained in Stealth and Survival

* * *

You're skilled in subtle tactics and using the environment against your enemies. You become trained in your choice of Deception or Thievery; if you are already trained in both, you become an expert in one instead. When you take this dedication, choose a single, discrete urban or wilderness location, such as "Mzali" or "the Verduran Forest"; this becomes your favored location. When you are in this location and undetected by all enemies, you can [[Actions/Sneak|Sneak]] without attempting a Stealth check as long as you move no more than half your Speed. During exploration, this also allows you to automatically approach within 15 feet of other creatures while Avoiding their Notice, as long as they aren't actively Searching or on guard.

You can change your favored location by spending 1 week of downtime in the new location you would like to set as your favored location.

## [[Feats/Poisoned Sticks and Stones|Poisoned Sticks and Stones]] Feat 6

*   archetype

You prepare your sling stones with small, edged grooves to enable them to deliver poison, and you have learned other techniques for poisoning your weapons. You can apply injury poisons to sling bullets, allowing them to deliver such poisons on a successful Strike.

During your daily preparations, you can prepare a number of simple injury poisons equal to your level that can only be applied to sling bullets or blowgun darts. These follow the rules for injury poisons, except that they deal 1d4 poison damage with no saving throw. Only you can apply these poisons properly, and they expire at your next daily preparations.

* * *

**Special** If you later gain the [[Feats/Poison Weapon|Poison Weapon]] feat (such as from the poisoner archetype or the rogue multiclass archetype), you can apply your injury poisons to any weapon that is normally a valid receptacle for injury poisons, but you do not gain additional simple injury poisons during your daily preparations.

## [[Feats/Rally Support|Rally Support]] Feat 8

*   archetype
*   skill

You often rely on the local populace for supplies and shelter.

## [[Feats/Battlefront Sabotage|Battlefront Sabotage]] Feat 10

*   archetype
*   incapacitation

**Requirements** You have a free hand.

* * *

You know methods of sabotaging your enemy's war machines and weaponry. You can attempt to sabotage a siege weapon or vehicle with a `Thievery check` check against the standard DC of the weapon or vehicle's level.

* * *

**Critical Success** The next time the weapon is Launched or the vehicle moves, it targets or moves to a square of your choice instead of its intended target.

**Success** As critical success, but the weapon or vehicle targets or moves to a random square.

**Failure** The sabotage fails.

Additionally, you can use Battlefront Sabotage to sabotage a weapon an enemy is wielding. Choose a creature wielding a melee or ranged weapon within your reach and attempt a Thievery check against their Reflex DC. On a success, the weapon's wielder must succeed at a `DC 11 Flat check` the next time it attempts a Strike with that weapon or the action is disrupted, as part of the weapon's structural integrity falters. The creature is then temporarily immune to Battlefront Sabotage of their weapons for 10 minutes.

## [[Feats/Frightful Attrition|Frightful Attrition]] Feat 12

*   archetype
*   emotion
*   fear

*   mental

Your diminishment of your foes' ranks damages their morale. Whenever you reduce a creature to 0 HP with a Strike or spell, all enemies within 30 feet of the downed creature who witnessed the attack must attempt a `Will check` saving throw against your class DC. A creature that didn't see you directly (such as if you're [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]] or remained [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] after the attack) takes a â€“2 circumstance penalty to this save. Regardless of the result, each creature is temporarily immune to your Frightful Attrition for 10 minutes.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]].

**Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]].

**Critical Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 3]] and [[Conditions/Fleeing|Fleeing]] for 1 round.
