Whether for coin, glory, or justice, you know how to track, defeat, and capture dangerous individuals. You're accustomed to perusing wanted posters, following up on leads, and pursuing your quarry to hell and back. Once you locate your prey's trail, you're unshakable. Additionally, you have the skills and experience to subdue even the most troublesome mark and bring them in to secure your reward.
