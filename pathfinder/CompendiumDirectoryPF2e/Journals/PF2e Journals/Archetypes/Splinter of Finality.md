# Splinter of Finality
During the events of the Night of the Gray Death, the final blade known as _Silent Lenore_ was overwhelmed by a surge of psychic energy that shattered it into 13 fragments. While many final blades since recovered have been rendered inert and harmless by means of the _blunt the final blade ritual_, the remnants of _Silent Lenore_—and perhaps some other final blades still unaccounted for—were recovered in secret and crafted into powerful talismans of cruelty.

The _splinter of finality_ is an archetype artifact, a type of powerful item.

## [[Equipment/Splinter of Finality|Splinter of Finality]] Item 2

*   rare
*   artifact
*   invested
*   occult

The sharpness of this dark metal splinter never dulls. By plunging it into your neck, you anchor your soul to the fragment, granting you protection from those that would harm it at the cost of weakening your body. You take a –1 status penalty to saving throws against effects that would give you the [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy]], [[Conditions/Drained|Drained]], or [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled]] condition. At 10th level, the penalty increases to –2. However, you gain spirit resistance equal to your level and a +2 status bonus to saving throws against spirits or haunts and effects that would give you the [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]], [[Conditions/Controlled|Controlled]], [[Conditions/Doomed|Doomed]], or [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied]] conditions.

* * *

**Destruction** All 13 splinters of finality must be gathered and used to reconstruct _Silent Lenore_, which must then be destroyed by means of the [[Spells/Blunt the Final Blade|Blunt the Final Blade]] ritual.

## [[Feats/Spectral Dagger|Spectral Dagger]] Feat 2

*   archetype
*   manipulate

By touching the splinter of finality in your neck, you conjure a [[Equipment/Spectral Dagger|Spectral Dagger]] into your hand that resembles the splinter wrapped in a crude hilt. This weapon acts like a _+1 ghost touch dagger_, and each successful Strike with it deals 1 additional spirit damage. If the attack is a critical hit, this damage increases to 1d6.

If the _spectral dagger_ ever leaves your hand, it vanishes and you must spend an action to conjure it again. If this occurs as the result of you making a ranged thrown Strike with the dagger, you resolve the attack before the weapon vanishes.

You can increase the power of your _spectral dagger_ with runes like you can other weapons, transferring the rune from a _runestone_ or other weapon by meditating over the rune as a downtime activity that takes 1 day.

## [[Feats/Dread Blade|Dread Blade]] Feat 4

*   archetype

Your strikes with your conjured dagger impart the chill of the grave. When you successfully Strike with your _spectral dagger_ and damage a foe with the [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened]] condition, they can't reduce their frightened condition below 1 before the end of your next turn.

## [[Feats/Soul Bleed|Soul Bleed]] Feat 6

*   archetype

Your blade can rupture an enemy's very soul, draining away its essence to empower you. When you score a critical hit with your [[Equipment/Spectral Dagger|Spectral Dagger]], you deal 1d6 persistent spirit damage. If the target wasn't already taking persistent spirit damage when you scored the critical hit, you gain temporary Hit Points equal to the spirit damage dealt by the attack that last until the beginning of your next turn.

## [[Feats/Soul Well|Soul Well]] Feat 8

*   archetype
*   concentrate
*   manipulate
*   occult

Your brush your fingers across your splinter of finality, momentarily creating a metaphysical vortex from which mortal spirits struggle to escape. For the next minute, incorporeal undead treat all squares within 30 feet of you as difficult terrain and living creatures within the same area die from the dying condition at dying 5 rather than dying 4.

As it comes close to tasting a living soul, the splinter of finality is empowered. If a living creature's dying value increases while within your Soul Well, your spectral dagger deals one additional weapon die of damage until the end of your next turn.

The echoes of the splinter of finality's original purpose resonate through the artifact.

When you use Snicker-Snack with your _spectral dagger_, the DC of the `Fortitude check` save is 37, your class DC, or your spell DC, whichever is higher.

## [[Feats/Soul Oubliette|Soul Oubliette]] Feat 20

*   archetype
*   concentrate
*   occult
*   unholy

**Trigger** You reduce a creature to 0 Hit Points with an attack from your spectral dagger.

**Requirements** Your splinter of finality doesn't contain a trapped soul.

* * *

Your mortal strike wrenches the soul from your victim's body and imprisons it in your splinter of finality, with the effects of seize soul. The splinter of finality can only hold one soul at a time, but you can release a trapped soul as a free action. If you don't free a soul willingly, it escapes automatically after 24 hours. However, if you touch the splinter of finality to an unbroken final blade while a soul is trapped within, the soul is transferred to the final blade and imprisoned indefinitely.

While your splinter of finality contains a trapped soul, you gain fast healing 15.
