# Archetype Artifacts
Archetype artifacts are powerful items that grant access to archetype feats linked to the artifact. Once an archetype artifact is invested, it can't be removed or uninvested by normal means. Gaining possession of an archetype artifact and investing it gives you access to its related archetype feats in the same way that taking the dedication feat for a standard archetype allows you to choose its feats whenever you gain a class feat. A character can invest only one archetype artifact at a time. Attempting to invest an additional archetype artifact fails as the first artifact's claim over you outweighs the second's; no benefits are granted, the second artifact is not invested, and you are aware of the failure. If the artifact is destroyed, the bonded character also loses access to any of its granted feats and must immediately retrain all feats granted by the archetype artifact for new feats that they qualify for.
