# Iridian Choirmaster
*   Uncommon

When the Iridian Fold disbanded, a splinter sect of this philosophical group called the Iridian Choir, which originated within the city of Ular Kel in Casmaron, rose to prominence in Kaer Maga. You are a member of this school of ideology and martial prowess, seeking another to form a bonded pair called a szerik. Together, you practice moving, fighting, and even speaking in complete harmony so that your souls may unite into one, a single spirit in two bodies. While this relationship can be quite intimate, the Iridian Choir believes any type of bond can bring a szerik to the true enlightenment known as "shared mind, shared heart," whether it be romantic or platonic.

You've chosen a student to train in the Iridian Choir's philosophy, which teaches that two people battling together are greater than the sum of their parts. You and your student share a deep connection, the nature of which is up to the two of you. As a symbol of your bond, you might each wear small, identical chains somewhere on your body. You and your student spend a lot of time practicing, seeking to achieve that perfect blending of souls to lead to enlightenment.

## [[Feats/Iridian Choirmaster Dedication|Iridian Choirmaster Dedication]] Feat 2

*   Uncommon
*   archetype
*   dedication

**Prerequisites** trained in Occultism

* * *

When you take this dedication, choose one willing, non-minion ally to be your student in the ways of the Iridian Choir. As part of your training in this archetype, you teach your student the necessary mindset and techniques; they gain the benefits of your abilities without having to take any feats of their own. You gain the benefits of your Iridian Choirmaster archetype feats only if both you and your student are alive and conscious.

You and your student can trade nonverbal messages as a single action, which have the effects of the [[Spells/Message|Message]] spell but are non-magical. This requires a single action, has the concentrate, mental, and linguistic traits, and requires that you be able to see each other.

If your student dies, or if you and your student choose to part ways, you can choose and develop a new student by spending 1 week of downtime training another willing, non-minion ally.

* * *

**Special** Your student can't be the student of another character with the Iridian Choirmaster Dedication, and if your student takes the Iridian Choirmaster Dedication, they must choose you to be their student.

If both of you are targeted by the same mental effect requiring a saving throw, you and your student take the better of each of your die rolls for the save. You each still add your own save modifier to the die result. This is a fortune effect.
