# Poisoner
People are so delightfully fragile when exposed to the insidious power of nature. The bite of a certain serpent makes the blood congeal to jelly. A particular stone, suitably powdered, induces powerful hallucinations and delirium. The sap of a rare tree inflicts such agony that death seems preferable. The deadly medicines of nature have been molded to create concoctions capable of both killing and debilitating. Neither option is pleasant for the unfortunate recipient. You are a student of such dark wonders, making you a dangerous foe indeed.

## [[Feats/Poisoner Dedication|Poisoner Dedication]] Feat 2

*   archetype
*   dedication

You make a point of always having a few toxins near at hand—you never know when some arsenic or the like might prove useful. You gain the [[PF2e Journals/Archetypes/advanced alchemy benefits|advanced alchemy benefits]]. You can use advanced alchemy to create four alchemical poison consumables each day. You remember alchemical poison formulas and don't need a formula book for them.

## [[Feats/Poisoner's Twist|Poisoner's Twist]] Feat 4

*   archetype

**Requirements** Your last action was a successful melee Strike that dealt damage against a target afflicted by a poison, and you know which poison.

Poisons attack specific parts of the body—one venom might target the lungs, another the circulatory system, while another deteriorates the nerves. You know how to take advantage of such weaknesses. You deal 1d6 untyped damage of the required Strike's damage type and 1d6 poison damage to the target. If you're at least 18th level, you deal 2d6 untyped damage of each type.

* * *

**Special** At 10th level or higher, you can select this feat a second time to increase the number to 8.

## [[Feats/Poison Coat|Poison Coat]] Feat 6

*   archetype

In nature, certain animals are covered in venomous spines, and just brushing against them can prove deadly. You expend a contact or injury poison and spend 10 minutes brushing that poison onto your clothing or weaving sharp, poisoned needles into the garment's fabric. You can have only one poison suffused into your clothing at a time. You can use the [[Actions/Once Bitten|Once Bitten]] reaction while you have a poison suffused in this way.

## [[Feats/Acquired Tolerance|Acquired Tolerance]] Feat 8

*   archetype
*   fortune

**Trigger** You fail a save against a poison.

* * *

A small amount of poison, taken at nonlethal doses, can help the body build up resistance against a more deadly dosage. Reroll the triggering check and use the second result. Once you use Acquired Tolerance, you can continue to use it against the same type of poison that day, but you can't use it against a different type of poison until after you make your next daily preparations. For instance, if you used the reaction on a save against [[Equipment/Giant Scorpion Venom|Giant Scorpion Venom]], you could use it again against giant scorpion venom even if it came from a different source, but you couldn't use it against [[Equipment/Wyvern Poison|Wyvern Poison]].

## [[Feats/Chemical Contagion|Chemical Contagion]] Feat 18
