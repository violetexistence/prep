# Scroll Trickster
Magic has been written down in myriad forms for a very long time. From the classic rolled parchment to strings tied with a hundred intricate knots, from baked clay tablets covered with incisions to bound collections of bamboo slips, magic is everywhere. You just need to know how to read it. You have studied the art of reading magical scrolls of various kinds. The language of magic is yours to use and manipulate, however unstable and archaic such writing tends to be.

## [[Feats/Scroll Trickster Dedication|Scroll Trickster Dedication]] Feat 2

**Prerequisites** trained in Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion

* * *

You've studied scrolls in depth. This might have been a comprehensive education in formal setting, or the sort of education where you somehow obtain a number of scrolls and try not to explode anything you didn't mean to explode. You gain the Trick Magic Item feat, and you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to skill checks to Trick scrolls. If you roll a critical failure to Trick a Magic Item that's a scroll, you get a failure instead.

## [[Feats/Basic Scroll Cache|Basic Scroll Cache]] Feat 6

*   archetype

You have a vast and overflowing collection of scroll scraps, riddled with errors and misspellings and leaking energy like a sieve. With enough care, you can coax these scroll scraps into functioningâ€”briefly.

Each day during your daily preparations, you can create a single temporary scroll containing a 1st-rank spell. The spell must be a common spell, a spell to which you have access, or a spell you are able to cast, and you must be trained in the skill corresponding to at least one of the spell's traditions. You can use [[Actions/Learn a Spell|Learn a Spell]] to add spells to those you can use with this feat, even if you aren't a spellcaster. This scroll is an unstable, temporary item and loses its magic the next time you make your daily preparations if you haven't already used it. This temporary scroll can't be used to Learn the Spell.

At 8th level, add a second temporary scroll containing a 2nd-rank spell.

## [[Feats/Master Scroll Cache|Master Scroll Cache]] Feat 18

*   archetype

Your scroll collection is incredible, brimming with eldritch power, and you can prepare far more of them than an ordinary scroll trickster.

In addition to your daily scrolls from the Basic and Expert Scroll Caches, add a single scroll with a 6th-rank spell. At 20th level, add a scroll with a 7th-rank spell.
