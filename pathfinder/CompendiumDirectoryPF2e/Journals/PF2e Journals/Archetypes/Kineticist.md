# Kineticist
You have, intentionally or accidentally, awoken a gateway to elemental power inside yourself and can now channel that power to devastating effect, adding an elemental arsenal to your abilities

## [[Feats/Kineticist Dedication|Kineticist Dedication]] Feat 2

*   archetype
*   dedication
*   multiclass

**Prerequisites** Constitution +2

* * *

You become trained in kineticist class DC and impulse attack rolls. Choose one element to be your kinetic element (air, earth, fire, metal, water, or wood). You gain a kinetic aura and the [[Actions/Channel Elements|Channel Elements]] action, though you don't get to use an [[Actions/Elemental Blast|Elemental Blast]] or stance impulse when you take that action. You gain the Elemental Blast action. Your Elemental Blast does not automatically gain additional damage dice every four levels, instead requiring you to take the [[Feats/Improved Elemental Blast|Improved Elemental Blast]] feat.

## [[Feats/Base Kinesis|Base Kinesis]] Feat 4

*   archetype

You gain the Base Kinesis impulse. For the purposes of determining when the range and Bulk improvements of the action occur, your kineticist level is equal to half your level (for example, Base Kinesis for a 10th-level character with this feat would have a range of 45 feet and could affect 1 Bulk of their chosen element).
