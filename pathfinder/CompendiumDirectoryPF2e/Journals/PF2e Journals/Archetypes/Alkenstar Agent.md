*   Uncommon
*   archetype
*   dedication

**Prerequisites** trained in Deception and at least one firearm

**Access** You have been initiated by the grand duchess of Alkenstar or one of her agents.

You put on the persona of a rough and tumble outlaw, but your real goals are to report threats to Alkenstar back to the grand duchess. You become an expert in Deception and trained in your choice of Underworld Lore or Legal Lore; if you were already trained, you become an expert instead. You gain the [[Feats/Lie to Me|Lie to Me]] skill feat.

## [[Feats/Loose Cannon|Loose Cannon]] Feat 4

*   archetype

Your unpredictable gunfire often catches enemies off guard or hits unprotected areas. Make a ranged Strike with a firearm against a creature that you haven't already attacked on this turn. You gain a circumstance bonus to damage on this Strike equal to the number of weapon damage dice. The Strike gains the following failure effect.

* * *

**Failure** The firearm misfires, but it doesn't cause the other critical failure effects listed below.

**Critical Failure** The firearm misfires and also explodes. It becomes [[Conditions/Broken|Broken]], and it deals its normal weapon damage to all creatures in a 20-foot burst centered on the firearm, with a `Reflex check` against your class DC. This damage includes any from the weapon's fundamental and property runes.

## [[Feats/Prepare Papers|Prepare Papers]] Feat 7

*   archetype
*   skill

You're practiced at creating forgeries that establish your outlaw credentials or augment your legal authority. You can [[Actions/Create Forgery|Create Forgery]] as an exploration activity. It takes you about 1 hour per page of the document that you're forging. This time is reduced to 10 minutes per page if you're legendary in Society.

## [[Feats/Flash Your Badge|Flash Your Badge]] Feat 10

*   archetype

You make a fearsome show of your authority. Roll Intimidation checks to [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] each creature in a 30-foot cone. When you do so, Demoralize gains the visual trait, and creatures are affected if they can see you. If a target creature hasn't broken a law in the past week (as determined by the GM), the result of your check against that creature is one degree of success worse than the result you rolled.
