# Archer
Bows of all types are powerful weapons. Generals and hunters alike recognize the power in dealing death from a distance, and from behind safe cover. Those dedicated to the bow—from mysterious cloaked strangers to heartless snipers—are often viewed with a mixture of respect and fear. Like any weapons adept, the archer's skill is forged through experience and constant practice. A true archer becomes one with their bow and is able to make incredible shots with their weapon that most would consider impossible, or at the very least magical.
