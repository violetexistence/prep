# Assassin
Targeted killing through stealth and subterfuge is the expertise of an assassin. While assassins are skilled in ending lives and many are evil, some live by a moral code, preying on the wicked, the cruel, or those who revel in unchecked aggression or power.

**Additional Feats:** **4th** [[Feats/Poison Resistance|Poison Resistance]]; **6th** [[Feats/Poison Weapon|Poison Weapon]], [[Feats/Sneak Attacker|Sneak Attacker]]; **10th** [[Feats/Improved Poison Weapon|Improved Poison Weapon]]

## [[Feats/Angel of Vindication|Angel of Vindication]] Feat 4

*   Uncommon
*   archetype

**Requirements** Your mark is an undead creature.

* * *

To aid with your mission of destroying undead, you've specialized in techniques to destroy them, much as other assassins learn to kill the living. When you Strike an [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] undead foe with a weapon that has the backstabber weapon trait, you deal 3 extra precision damage instead of 1. If the weapon is a +3 weapon, you deal 6 extra precision damage instead of 2. If you have the Angel of Death feat, your attacks also instantly destroy undead at 0 Hit Points, and attempts for the undead to rejuvenate-such as via a lich's soul cage or a ghost's rejuvenation ability-fail unless the effect's counteract rank is higher than half your level when you killed the creature (rounded up), or originates from an artifact or deity. Finally, if you have the Assassinate feat and an undead mark critically fails its save against your Assassinate, it is destroyed.

## [[Feats/Eclipsed Vitality|Eclipsed Vitality]] Feat 4

*   Uncommon
*   archetype
*   skill

You shroud yourself in ashes that hide the vital essence sought by life-sensing undead. You're always taking precautions when [[Actions/Avoid Notice|Avoiding Notice]], [[Actions/Hide|Hiding]], and [[Actions/Sneak|Sneaking]] to foil lifesense, and you're [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] to any creature using only precise lifesense to observe you.

*   archetype

You excel at quickly dispatching your foes. When you Strike an [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] foe with a weapon that has the backstabber weapon trait, you deal 2 extra precision damage instead of 1. If the weapon is a _+3 weapon_, you deal 4 extra precision damage instead of 2.

## [[Feats/Surprise Attack|Surprise Attack]] Feat 4

## [[Feats/Public Execution|Public Execution]] Feat 8

*   Uncommon
*   archetype
*   auditory
*   flourish
*   linguistic

**Requirements** You have designated a mark using [[Actions/Mark for Death|Mark for Death]].

* * *

Some rebel Firebrand cells make a practice of publicly declaring the main target of a given operation. You announce your intention to kill your mark for all to hear and reveal the reason they must die, perhaps listing their crimes or sharing a damning secret. Creatures within 30 feet who can see and hear you are shocked by your proclamation or otherwise reluctant to come to your mark's aid. They must attempt a `Will check` save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. On a failure, the creature can't attack you or otherwise perform hostile actions against you until the end of your next turn. If you use a hostile action against a creature other than your mark, this effect ends. Your mark becomes temporarily immune to your Public Execution for 1 day.

## [[Feats/Angel of Death|Angel of Death]] Feat 10

*   archetype

All your Strikes against a creature you have [[Actions/Mark for Death|Marked for Death]] have the death trait, causing the mark to be instantly killed when reduced to 0 Hit Points.

In addition, if the creature is killed this way, attempts to communicate with it, return it to life, turn it into an undead, or otherwise disturb its afterlife fail unless the effect's counteract rank is higher than half your level rounded up, or originates from an artifact or a deity. Use the level you were when you killed the creature, even if your level is higher at the time the attempt was made.

## [[Feats/Assassinate|Assassinate]] Feat 12

*   archetype

**Requirements** You have designated a mark using [[Actions/Mark for Death|Mark for Death]] and are completely unnoticed by your mark.

* * *

You strike with one swift movement, trying to instantly slay your mark. Make a Strike against your mark. If you hit, your mark takes an additional 6d6 precision damage with a `Fortitude check` save against the higher of your class DC or spell DC. If the mark critically fails, it dies unless its level is higher than yours. Regardless of the result of its save, the creature is temporarily immune to your Assassinate for 1 day.
