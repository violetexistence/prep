# Broken Chain (Uncommon)
*   Uncommon

Wherever tyrants abuse their power, rebels soon follow, fighting against their oppression in disorganized and sporadic outbursts, often easily quashed by the tyrant, whose power grows yet stronger. But on rare occasions, one among the ranks of the rebels rises above and beyond to meet the tyrant at their level and lights the spark of an unstoppable revolutionary passion among their people, leading them to outmaneuver and eventually overpower their oppressor. Even should they fall at the hands of the tyrant's forces, their martyrdom will inflame the movement, inspiring another to take on the mantle, for a broken chain's greatest power is their bond to their movement.

Some bards yet tell tales of broken chains who, unwilling to give up the fight against a tyrant, broke the bonds which destiny had over their mortality, and quite literally came back to life in the body of another fervent follower of the cause. A few who have claimed the mantle of broken chain whisper to their closest friends that they have prevented a terrible death from occurring by somehow turning back the hands of time; witnessing this event has haunted their nightmares ever since, and they worry that they have somehow incurred the wrath of fate itself.

The five-winged angel **Thais** , Cayden Cailean's herald, embodies freedom and courage. She has gone as far as to fight the ruler of nine Hells, Asmodeus, to liberate one thousand innocent souls who were tricked into the clutches of hell by a vaguely worded diabolical contract. In the process, she paid a personal sacrifice: the loss of one of her feathery wings.

In Galt, the poets and philosophers **Darl Jubannich** (inspirational male human poet) and **Hosetter** (deceased male aiuvarin philosopher) led the people to revolt and fight against House Thrune, eventually forming the Revolutionary Council to rule the newly independent nation of Galt. Little did they know their lofty ideals would be turned against them when the council executed Hosetter with one of their final blade guillotines, trapping the philosopher's soul. Fearing for his own life, Jubannich fled the country.

In Ravounel, a mysterious group of champions of the people called the Silver Ravens overthrew Barzillai Thrune to establish the new country, independent from Cheliax. Many claim they were aided by a band of adventurers whose names have never been discovered, but whose contributions were vital to the cause.

The Bright Lions of Mzali, lead by the devout **Sihar** (revolutionary female human fighter), wage a cloak-and-dagger war of attrition against the forces of the tyrannical God-King Walkena. Sihar has also revived the worship of the Old Sun Gods, a trio of deities once forgotten.

Any of these individuals may be considered broken chains, destined to bring low a powerful tyrant or system of oppression and light a flame of liberty that will reverberate across history.

Which oppressive regime or ruler you will bring down is up to you. Leading your roused band of rebels, no unjust bond will survive for long, and evil despots across the land will quake in their boots at your passionate fury's advance. They will send spycatchers against your infiltrated saboteurs, deadly assassins to assail your key allies, and even the full might of a nation's army. You must heed the call to lead your movement against these threats and be brave enough to take on as much of the burden of danger as you can. Inspire your followers, protect them from harm, and lead them to freedom.

  

| Lightning the Flame of Liberty |
| --- |
| The broken chain mythic destiny tells of characters who will lead a revolution against an oppressive tyrant or system, inspiring those who follow to become an unstoppable force for liberty. Oppression can appear in all places and take many forms, and so your broken chain's journey will likely be unpredictable. From freeing those who are physically enslaved from their chains and manacles, to fighting insidious (but legal) economic hardships, to mentally liberating a people fooled into complacency, broken chains must face the underhanded machinations of tyrants as they come. The only constants in their journey are their unwavering resolve in the face of brutal repression, and the people they inspire through fervent ideas and daring action. |

## [[Feats/Broken Chain Dedication|Broken Chain Dedication]] Feat 12

*   Uncommon
*   destiny
*   mythic

Your Calling was sparked by your outrage at tyrants, after having witnessed a brutal act of oppression that you could no longer abide. You may spend a Mythic Point when you attempt an [[Actions/Escape|Escape]] or [[Actions/Force Open|Force Open]] check to do so at mythic proficiency. Additionally, you gain the [[Actions/Ultimatum of Liberation|Ultimatum of Liberation]] action, but you also gain the anathema, "You must not use Ultimatum of Liberation on a creature you don't believe to be oppressing others or who has conceded their power". If you break this anathema, you lose access to abilities granted by this archetype until you atone or make amends.

Your GM has final say about what constitutes oppression, which can be a difficult and sometimes nebulous concept. In general, oppression is the cruel and unjust use of authority or power. Some examples include performing acts of violence against those without power, removing an individual's agency through mind control magic, and engaging in organized mistreatment or exploitation of others. When the members of a royal guard assault a beggar just to get him off the street, that is oppression. When a tax collector levies higher charges against the less fortunate because it's the law, they are participating in a system of oppression.

## [[Feats/Bloc Tactics|Bloc Tactics]] Feat 14

*   mythic

You have experience in undertaking direct action and know how to protect the identity and health of you and your allies when doing so. During your daily preparations, you can select a number of targets equal to half your level. You disguise the targets to hide their identities, which gives them a +4 status bonus to Deception checks to prevent others from seeing through their disguises, and lets them add their level even if untrained. Additionally, the disguises also protect from smoke, fumes, and inhaled substances, giving the targets a +3 status bonus to saving throws against them. The targets can quickly doff or don their disguises with a two-action activity.

## [[Feats/Break the Cycle|Break the Cycle]] Feat 14

*   mythic

Sometimes people with no underlying quarrel have been fighting each other simply out of spite. You come to break that vicious cycle of hate. You gain the [[Feats/Legendary Negotiation|Legendary Negotiation]] skill feat, even if you would not normally qualify. Additionally, whenever you attempt a Diplomacy check, you may spend a Mythic Point to do so at mythic proficiency.

## [[Feats/Release Me!|Release Me!]] Feat 14

*   flourish
*   mythic

**Requirements** An enemy has you [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]].

* * *

Your retribution against one who would detain you is swift and dangerous. Make a melee Strike against the creature who has you [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]. You can still make this attack even if you are restrained, though not if you are wielding a two-handed weapon. Unless your Strike is a critical failure, you can then attempt a check to [[Actions/Escape|Escape]]. If the creature who has you grabbed or restrained is the target of your [[Actions/Ultimatum of Liberation|Ultimatum of Liberation]], you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to this check. Both the Strike and the Escape count toward your multiple attack penalty, but it doesn't increase until you've made both rolls.

## [[Feats/Rites of Liberation|Rites of Liberation]] Feat 14

*   mythic

You learn the [[Spells/Freedom|Freedom]] ritual. If you spend an additional Mythic Point while casting it, you reduce its casting time to 1 hour, and both the primary and secondary casters attempt their corresponding skill checks at mythic proficiency. If you would critically fail the ritual, you fail instead. Additionally, you gain the [[Spells/Unimpeded Stride|Unimpeded Stride]] and [[Spells/Word of Freedom|Word of Freedom]] domain spells. These are focus spells, granting you a focus pool of 2 Focus Points or expanding that pool if you already have one. You can Refocus while you meditate on the concepts of freedom and liberty.

## [[Feats/United Front|United Front]] Feat 14

*   mythic

Thanks to your powerful speeches, your movement finds allies in all sectors of society and even across enemy lines, all eager to help you accomplish your goals. If you spend a Mythic Point when you use [[Actions/Ultimatum of Liberation|Ultimatum of Liberation]], you can ask four questions related to that creature, as if you succeeded at four Recall Knowledge checks. This information comes to you over the course of the next 1 to 2 hours, representing tidbits of information you glean from local supporters. After receiving this information, the first time you roll Initiative in an encounter with the target of your Ultimatum of Liberation or their allies, you and all your allies can make your Initiative check with mythic proficiency.

## [[Feats/Bring Into the Fold|Bring Into the Fold]] Feat 16

*   auditory
*   emotion
*   linguistic
*   mental
*   mythic

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

Not all who oppress are irredeemable, and given encouragement and some time, they will abandon their cause and join your fight against the very system they used to uphold. If your next action is to issue an [[Actions/Ultimatum of Liberation|Ultimatum of Liberation]], you may have up to 10 targets who can hear you attempt a `Will check` save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. You can cause any changes in attitude to last longer than the current social interaction by spending at least 10 minutes speaking with the affected targets earnestly about your cause.

* * *

**Success** The target is unaffected.

**Failure** The target's attitude toward you improves by one step.

**Critical Failure** The target's attitude toward you improves by two steps.

## [[Feats/Cry of Rebellion|Cry of Rebellion]] Feat 16

*   auditory
*   mythic
*   sonic

**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

You let loose a yell of unbridled passion, which fuels your allies, and pounds against your foes. Allies within 60 feet who can hear you gain a +2 status bonus to attack rolls, Perception checks, saving throws, and skill checks for 1 minute.

[[Feat_Feature Effects/Effect_ Cry of Rebellion|Effect: Cry of Rebellion]]

Additionally, foes within 30 feet of you take 1d4 sonic damage (`Fortitude check` save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher). This sonic damage increases by 1d4 at 17th level and every level thereafter.

## [[Feats/Lose Your Chains|Lose Your Chains]] Feat 16

*   auditory
*   linguistic
*   mythic

**Trigger** An ally gains the [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]] condition.

* * *

You rouse rebellion in the hearts of your allies, inspiring them to break free of their bonds. The triggering ally can make a check to [[Actions/Escape|Escape]] at mythic proficiency.

## [[Feats/Remember Their Names|Remember Their Names]] Feat 16

*   auditory
*   linguistic
*   mental
*   mythic

You peer into the eyes of a target of your Ultimatum of Liberation, as you say aloud the names of their victims, searing them into the oppressor's mind, cursing them to feel their victims' pain. The target takes 12d6 mental damage (`Will check` save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher). If the target fails or critically fails this check, they also take 2d6 persistent mental damage.

For the next hour, when the target stops taking this persistent damage, you or one of your allies can mention a victim's name as a single action to the target, forcing them to succeed at another `Will check` save or begin taking the persistent damage again. This is a curse effect. Once you use Remember Their Names on a target, the target is immune to it for 24 hours.

## [[Feats/Stand Firm|Stand Firm]] Feat 16

*   auditory
*   linguistic
*   mythic

Your words help your ally shake off unease and terror. You shout a bolstering comment at an ally within 30 feet of you who has the [[Conditions/Fleeing|Fleeing]] or [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened]] condition and can hear you. That ally reduces the value of their frightened condition by 2 (to a minimum of 0). If they are fleeing, they can immediately attempt a new saving throw against the effect that caused the condition. If that save is a failure, but not a critical failure, the ally needs to spend one fewer action on their turn to escape the source of the fleeing condition. This allows that ally to Strike or Cast a one-action Spell that doesn't necessarily get them further away from the source, but the ally still has the fleeing condition and can't Delay or Ready as usual. If the ally is under an effect that reduces the number of actions they have on their turn, they don't gain this benefit on a failed saving throw. Once you use Stand Firm on an ally, that ally is immune to it until the beginning of your next turn.

## [[Feats/Liberty or Death|Liberty or Death]] Feat 18

*   death
*   incapacitation
*   mythic

**Requirements** A creature has been the target of your [[Actions/Ultimatum of Liberation|Ultimatum of Liberation]] for at least 1 minute

* * *

You have given a despot enough time to think, and now is the time for them to forfeit their control or die. Spend a Mythic Point and make a Strike at mythic proficiency against the required creature. If you succeed and deal damage, the target must succeed on a `Fortitude check` save against your class DC or spell DC (whichever is higher) or die. If the target succeeds, they are immune to this ability for 24 hours.

## [[Feats/Rebellious Existence|Rebellious Existence]] Feat 18

*   mythic

You have tied yourself so absolutely to the cause of liberty that your very existence is an act of rebellion. You ignore any mental effects without the fear trait that would rob you of your agency (for example, on a failed save against [[Spells/Charm|Charm]] you would still be able to take hostile actions, and against [[Spells/Laughing Fit|Laughing Fit]] you would still be able to take reactions but would remain [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed]], but on a critical failure against [[Spells/Fear|Fear]] you would still be [[Conditions/Fleeing|Fleeing]] because it's a fear effect).

Additionally, you are immune to effects that would imprison your soul (such as [[Spells/Seize Soul|Seize Soul]], or a [[Equipment/Final Blade|Final Blade]]).

## [[Feats/Reprisal of the Fallen|Reprisal of the Fallen]] Feat 18

*   mythic

You can feel the sorrow, pain, and rage of those fallen to oppression, peering from just behind the veil of death, and you can bring them forth to exact their revenge. You can cast either a 9th-rank [[Spells/Invoke Spirits|Invoke Spirits]] or [[Spells/Wails of the Damned|Wails of the Damned]] once per day as an innate occult spell. For either spell, use your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.

## [[Feats/Break the Causal Chain|Break the Causal Chain]] Feat 20

*   concentrate
*   mythic

**Frequency** once per month

* * *

Something terrible has happened. A beloved ally has fallen, a last stand has failed, or a tyrant has beaten you to a crucial goal. Whatever it is, your heart sinks. How can this be? No, this can't be. You spend a Mythic Point to alter reality as if you got a success (but not a critical success) with the [[Spells/Wish|Wish]] ritual. You must choose to completely undo the effects of a past action or set of actions that occurred within the past week to lead to the undesirable outcome. This will bring serious consequences back to haunt you some day. Altering the rhythm of causality is likely to draw the attention of certain aeons. Fey norns won't be too happy with you fraying their precious threads of fate either. Deities whose domains include change, fate, freedom, time, or tyranny are likely to start keeping tabs on you, if they haven't already, and send their agents to meddle in your affairs.
