# Firework Technician
*   Uncommon

The brilliant display of cascading lights and flickering aerial flowers, the thunderous boom, the sizzling crackle, and piercing screechâ€”these are the stock and trade of your craft. You know how to perfectly pair light and sound to create fireworks displays that can amaze children and adults, comfort friends, and even confound your foes.

As a fireworks technician, you might be an itinerant wanderer, roaming from town to town and developing your craft on your own. In that case, you make a living on the road, selling fireworks to the townsfolk, setting up public displays upon request and receipt of payment, and even tailoring individualized performances to those wealthy or interesting enough to be worthy of receiving their own private show.

On the other hand, you might be part of an established fireworks house from Tian Xia or Vudra and rely on teamwork to perfect your various formulas and displays. Hoping to produce the next great innovation in fireworks technology, you often send back the notes from your studies and field demonstrations to esteemed colleagues from your fireworks house, seeking their opinions on your next big idea.

  

| Describing Your Fireworks Display |
| --- |
| As a firework technician, the exact visuals of your character's special abilities might matter significantly to you. No two firework technicians use exactly the same fireworks display, even if they come from the same fireworks house and both use the same feat to generate the display. In fact, it's likely that when you use a feat from the firework technician archetype, the resulting display remains a bit different each time as you tinker, perfect, and refine your technique. Even so, you probably have a few themes that you prefer for each of your firework technician feats. For instance, your Coughing Dragon Display might appear in the sinuous serpentine shape of a literal imperial dragon, coughing out glittering trails. It might also resemble a simple series of geometric shapes, an enigmatic spiraling aeon trailing off in a shape with radial symmetry, a pattern shaped like a tree blossoming with flowers in the sky, or anything else you can imagine. To help your fellow players visualize what your character is doing, you might come up with some go-to descriptions or draw art depicting some of your favorite displays. |

You've learned the secrets of making fire and sound bloom using black powder, metals, and paper.

You become trained in Fireworks Lore or become an expert if you were already trained in it. You gain the Alchemical Crafting feat, the advanced alchemy benefits, and the Quick Alchemy benefits, creating up to 4 versatile vials during your daily preparations. You can replenish these vials during exploration just like an alchemist can. You can use your versatile vials to make fireworks, [[Actions/Launch Fireworks|Launch Fireworks]], and use other feats from this archetype.

You can also create a special item called a fireworks display using your daily alchemical consumables from your advanced alchemy benefits. These displays are designed to create distinctive effects you can use to make onlookers marvel and even to gain an advantage in combat. You gain the Launch Fireworks action and learn some basic effects. You can learn additional, more complex displays that use your daily fireworks display resources through other firework technician feats. The DC for any display is equal to your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.
