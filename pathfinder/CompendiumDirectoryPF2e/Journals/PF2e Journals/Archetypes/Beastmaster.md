# Beastmaster
You attract the loyalty of animals, and as your powers increase, you can command more of them, briefly inhabit their body to perceive what they perceive, and even communicate with them over vast distances.

**Additional Feats:** **4th** [[Feats/Animal Empathy (Ranger)|Animal Empathy (Ranger)]],[[Feats/Initiate Warden|Initiate Warden]]([[Spells/Heal Companion|Heal Companion]] and [[Spells/Magic Hide|Magic Hide]] only); **6th** [[Feats/Advanced Warden|Advanced Warden]] ([[Spells/Enlarge Companion|Enlarge Companion]] only), [[Feats/Companion's Cry|Companion's Cry]]; **14th** [[Feats/Side by Side (Ranger)|Side by Side]]. Warden spells granted by these feats are beastmaster focus spells for you.

| Beastmaster Animal Companions |
| --- |
| If you're playing a beastmaster, you determine the statistics and abilities of your animal companions according to the rules on pages 206–211 of _Player Core_. As a beastmaster, it's possible for you to have more than one animal companion at one time—up to four companions—but only one of those companions, your "active companion," follows you during exploration and in encounters; the rest are nearby, usually foraging or hunting for food. As soon as you gain a second animal companion from the Beastmaster archetype, you also gain [[Actions/Call Companion\|Call Companion]] to switch your active companion. These rules apply to all your companions, regardless of whether you got the animal companion from the beastmaster archetype or from another source. |

## [[Feats/Beastmaster Dedication|Beastmaster Dedication]] Feat 2

*   archetype
*   dedication

**Prerequisites** trained in Nature

* * *

You gain the service of a young animal companion that travels with you and obeys your commands. Contrary to the usual rules for animal companions, this feat can grant you a second animal companion. If you ever have more than one animal companion, you gain the Call Companion action. See the Beastmaster Animal Companions sidebar for details on this action.

Certain beastmaster feats give you focus spells. When you gain your first beastmaster focus spell, you become trained in the spell attack modifier and spell DC statistics. Your key spellcasting attribute for beastmaster archetype spells is Charisma, and they are primal spells. You can Refocus by feeding, playing with, or otherwise tending to an animal companion.

## [[Feats/Additional Companion|Additional Companion]] Feat 4

*   archetype

Another animal joins you in your travels. It is a young animal companion that has the minion trait. See Beastmaster Animal Companions (in Beastmaster Dedication) for rules on how having multiple animal companions works.

**Special** You can select this feat more than once, gaining an additional animal companion each time, to a maximum of four total companions (including the one you gained from Beastmaster Dedication and possibly one you gained from sources other than the beastmaster archetype).

## [[Feats/Mature Beastmaster Companion|Mature Beastmaster Companion]] Feat 4

*   archetype

All of your animal companions grow up, becoming mature animal companions and gaining additional capabilities.

Your animal companion has greater independence. During an encounter, even if you don't use the Command an Animal action, your active animal companion can still use 1 action that round on your turn to Stride or Strike. It can do this at any point during your turn, as long as you aren't currently taking an action. If it does, that's all the actions it gets that round—you can't Command it later.
