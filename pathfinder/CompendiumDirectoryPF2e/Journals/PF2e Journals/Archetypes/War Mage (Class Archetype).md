# War Mage (Class Archetype)
*   Uncommon

You learned the arcane craft at a war college, focusing less on theory and scholarship and more on applied magic and how best to leverage spellcraft on the battlefield. You were schooled in arcana, tried and tested in war, and learned how and when best to employ those spells to turn the tide of battle. Your training included lessons on swordplay and the upkeep of armor alongside the preparation of spells and the deciphering of arcane runes.

There are many war colleges that provide this specialized training. Perhaps you were schooled in one of Molthune's military academies, or as part of your military training in Taldor or Qadira. Regardless of the source, your unique skills make your combat magic some of the most potent on Golarion.

### [[Class Features/War Magic|War Magic]] 1st

Your studies have focused on using magic on the battlefield along with the basics of warfare. With a sturdy breastplate to turn aside errant arrows, you confidently use your spells to turn the tide of battle. If you choose this class archetype, you must select [[Feats/War Mage Dedication|War Mage Dedication]] as your 2nd-level class feat.

**Prerequisites:** You must be a wizard.

**War Mage Adjustments:** You become trained in light and medium armor. At 11th level, you gain expert proficiency with light and medium armor, as well as unarmored defense.

You gain the [[Feats/Shield Block|Shield Block]] general feat at 1st level.

You gain the war magic class feature at 1st level.

You must choose the [[Class Features/School of Battle Magic|School of Battle Magic]] as your arcane school.

You have familiarity with martial weapons, treating them as simple weapons for the purposes of proficiency. You do not gain the [[Class Features/Arcane Bond|Arcane Bond]] or [[Class Features/Arcane Thesis|Arcane Thesis]] class features.

You do not gain the [[Class Features/Defensive Robes|Defensive Robes]] feature at 13th level.

**War Magic:** As a free action that can be taken once per round at the start of your turn, you can exchange any spell you currently have memorized for [[Spells/Sure Strike|Sure Strike]], heightened to the same level as the replaced spell. As normal, you can cast most spells while wielding a weapon in your hands. You can Refocus by studying plans of war, maps of troop movement, and reports from the field for an active conflict in lieu of studying your spellbook.

## [[Feats/War Mage Dedication|War Mage Dedication]] Feat 2

*   Uncommon
*   archetype
*   class
*   dedication

**Prerequisites** You have a spellcasting class feature.

* * *

Your studies into the battlefield applications of magic have made your spells particularly effective at disrupting enemy formations or manipulating enemy troops into positions where they are more vulnerable to wide-scale magical attacks. When you cast a non-cantrip spell that deals damage in an area, choose a number of targets equal to your Intelligence modifier who failed their saving throw against the effect. Move each one up to 10 feet from their original position after they take damage and any other effects from the spell. You can't move a creature into or through obstacles. A Medium or smaller creature counts as one target; a Large creature counts as two Medium creatures; and a Huge creature counts as four Medium creatures. You can't move Gargantuan creatures in this way.

You also gain the [[Feats/Additional Lore|Additional Lore]] general feat for Warfare Lore. If you were already trained in Warfare Lore, you become trained in a Lore skill of your choice.

## [[Feats/Mage's Field Dressing|Mage's Field Dressing]] Feat 4

*   archetype

**Requirements** Your previous action was to Cast a Spell from a wizard spell slot, and the spell affected an ally within 60 feet.

* * *

As your spell takes hold on your ally, you use some of its magic to quickly dress their wounds. You use [[Feats/Battle Medicine|Battle Medicine]] on one ally affected by the required spell. You do not need to be holding or wearing a [[Equipment/Healer's Toolkit|Healer's Toolkit]], as you conjure glowing threads, bandages, or similar supplies out of pure magic, which adds the arcane trait to Battle Medicine.

*   archetype
*   spellshape

**Requirements** You are wielding a shield.

* * *

You can empower your defensive magic by channeling it through a physical shield. If your next action is to cast the [[Spells/Shield|Shield]] cantrip, you use your shield as a locus to cast the spell, raising a magical barrier in the form of a large force projection of your worn shield. You can choose for an adjacent ally to gain the benefits of the _shield_ spell instead of yourself. If the ally would take damage from a physical attack while protected by your _shield_ cantrip, you can use your reaction to [[Feats/Shield Block|Shield Block]] with the spell on their behalf.

## [[Feats/Siege Ritualist|Siege Ritualist]] Feat 4

You learn a siege ritual of 2nd rank or lower. You must meet all prerequisites to be the primary caster of a ritual to select it.

At 8th level and every 4 levels thereafter, you learn another siege ritual with the same restriction and with a maximum rank of half that level.

Your shield becomes a bonded item capable of storing your spells. You gain the [[Class Features/Arcane Bond|Arcane Bond]] class feature and the [[Actions/Drain Bonded Item|Drain Bonded Item]] action. You must select a shield as your bonded item. When you make your daily preparations, you can prepare one fewer wizard spell to infuse that magic into your bonded item. This spell must be at least 1 rank lower than the highest-rank wizard spell slot you have. When you Drain your Bonded Item to Cast a Spell, that spell is automatically heightened to the rank of spell you infused into your shield, no matter what rank you originally prepared it at.

## [[Feats/Secrets of Steel|Secrets of Steel]] Feat 10

*   archetype

As your prowess with weapons increases, so does the ferocity of magic you channel through those weapons. When you use [[Feats/Bespell Strikes|Bespell Strikes]], you gain access to the critical specialization effect of the chosen weapon or unarmed attacks used with Bespell Strikes. If you critically hit with an attack modified by Bespell Strikes, you deal an additional 1d8 damage of the same type as the extra damage from Bespell Strikes; this damage is added after all other calculations and is not multiplied as part of the critical hit.

## [[Feats/Battlefield Arcana|Battlefield Arcana]] Feat 12

*   archetype
*   concentrate
*   spellshape

You have learned to safely cast spells even in the heat of battle. If the next action you use is to cast a wizard cantrip, or a wizard spell that is at least 2 ranks lower than the highest-rank wizard spell slot you have, that spell does not trigger reactions that normally trigger due to a spell being cast or someone using an action with the manipulate trait.

## War Mage Focus Spell

### [[Spells/Shielding Formation|Shielding Formation]] Focus 4

*   Uncommon
*   concentrate
*   focus
*   force
*   manipulate
*   wizard

You conjure magical shields of force to protect your allies around you. You and each ally who ends their turn within the emanation gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until they leave the emanation or the spell ends, whichever comes first. If an ally takes physical damage or damage from a spell or magical effect while being granted this bonus, they can choose to end the bonus for themselves as a free action to gain resistance 10 to all damage against the triggering damage. If they do, they become temporarily immune to the effects of _shielding formation_ for 10 minutes. You can do the same by spending your reaction; if you do, you can't cast _shielding formation_ again for 10 minutes, though you can continue Sustaining the benefits for others.
