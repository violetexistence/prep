# Wandering Chef
No matter where you go in Tian Xia, one thing you can always find with some reliability is good food. Tian Xia's many talented chefs practice a wide array of cooking techniques, and many can be found traveling between the continent's states and regions as frequently as any adventurer. Chefs from Zi Ha wander to expand their knowledge of cooking techniques, while culinarians from the Lung Wa Successor States visit foreign courts to display their pride in their regional cuisine.

## [[Feats/Wandering Chef Dedication|Wandering Chef Dedication]] Feat 2

*   dedication

**Prerequisites**

* * *

Whether trained in a noble kitchen or a humble home, you know how to cook delicious dishes and source ingredients from the wilderness or urban settings. You become trained in Crafting; if you were already trained in Crafting, you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You can use cookware instead of an alchemist's toolkit to craft alchemical foods. When using the [[Actions/Subsist|Subsist]] downtime activity, you can use Crafting or Cooking Lore in place of Survival, and if you roll a failure, you get a success instead.

You gain the [[PF2e Journals/Archetypes/Quick Alchemy benefits|Quick Alchemy benefits]], but can use it only to create consumables, and the consumables must be alchemical food. Any items you choose with [[Feats/Alchemical Crafting|Alchemical Crafting]] must be alchemical food, but they can be 1st level or 2nd level instead of only 1st level.

You create up to 4 versatile vials during your daily preparations. Typically, a wandering chef's versatile vials take the form of parcels of foraged ingredients.

## [[Feats/Food Preservation|Food Preservation]] Feat 6

*   archetype

Your techniques extend the storage life for certain ingredients and food through pickling, alcohol, or fermentation. When you use advanced alchemy to create alchemical food, you can designate one infused item to not automatically expire when you next make your daily preparations. When you preserve another item in this way, the previous item becomes inedible.

The number of items you can preserve during your daily preparation and the maximum number of items you can have preserved before spoiling older items increases to two if you're an expert in Crafting or Cooking Lore, to three if you're a master, and to five if you're legendary.

## [[Feats/Feast Planner|Feast Planner]] Feat 10

*   Uncommon
*   archetype

You learn the [[Spells/Fortifying Brew|Fortifying Brew]] ritual, but you instead prepare dishes for a lavish meal that have the same effect as the drinks from the normal version of the ritual. You perform both aspects of the ritual yourself, acting as both primary and a secondary caster. You must still attempt the secondary check normally performed by a secondary caster. In addition, you can use Crafting or Cooking Lore for both the primary and secondary checks. The ritual gains the primal trait as nature spirits attend to you and your guests.
