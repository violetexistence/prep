# Barbarian
There's a rage deep inside you that sometimes breaks loose, granting you some of the might of a barbarian in addition to your other abilities.

## [[Feats/Barbarian Dedication|Barbarian Dedication]] Feat 2

*   archetype
*   dedication
*   multiclass

**Prerequisites** Strength +2, Constitution +2

* * *

You become trained in Athletics; if you were already trained in Athletics, you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You become trained in barbarian class DC.

You can use the Rage action. While raging, you take a â€“1 penalty to AC.

Choose an instinct as you would if you were a barbarian. You have that instinct for all purposes, but you don't gain any of the other abilities it grants. If that instinct has anathema, you're bound by them.
