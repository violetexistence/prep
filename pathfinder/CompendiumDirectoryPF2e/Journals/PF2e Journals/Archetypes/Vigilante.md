# Vigilante
*   Uncommon

As a vigilante, you have two faces: a public persona, and a secret identity that lets you hide your extralegal actions from polite society. Your secret identity lets you adventure and carry out clandestine missions while keeping the civilians you care about safe. Whatever your purpose—fighting crime, inciting rebellion, sowing chaos—your vigilante identity makes you both hard to pin down and a mysterious, intriguing subject of gossip. While many adventurers prefer to bask in the glory or infamy of their actions, you keep that part of your life a secret. There are various reasons why you might do this. Perhaps you have something or someone in your life that you want to protect from the dangers and threats that your other life. Perhaps you are a public figure, and your alternate life could draw undue attention from your community. It could also be that you don't like attention and wish to retain the ability to step away from it all and relax in peace. Regardless of your reasons, you have a secret identity and will go to great lengths to keep it secret. Vigilantes can have many goals and agendas. Some see them as glory seekers, but more often than not, they are working towards some lofty goal. Perhaps they are trying to inspire a people to fight back against their oppressors. They could be hunting down a crime lord they have a personal vendetta against. Maybe they seek to rebalance the wealth of a nation, stealing from the rich to give to those in need. You are one such vigilante, living a hidden life so you can fight in secrecy. What will you do to keep your secret and continue down your path?

## [[Feats/Vigilante Dedication|Vigilante Dedication]] Feat 2

*   Uncommon
*   archetype
*   dedication

**Prerequisites** trained in Deception

* * *

You have two identities, each with its own name and abilities. Your social identity is an upstanding member of society, while your vigilante identity is a skilled and cunning warrior. Neither of these identities is a false front; you really are both of these people. If someone attempts to discern your other identity, they must use a [[Actions/Seek|Seek]] action to attempt a Perception check against your Deception DC, as if you were using the Impersonate action. Your Deception DC against such attempts is 20 + your proficiency modifier instead of the normal DC. Unlike with Impersonate, you don't have to attempt a Deception check to interact with someone to conceal your other identity—a check happens only if someone else specifically tries to uncover your other identity.

Changing from one identity to the other takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures. As this process involves both physical changes such as clothing and makeup, along with an altered state of mind, other effects that change your appearance don't reduce the time required to change identities.

Your two identities are completely distinct. Checks to Recall Knowledge about one of your identities don't reveal information about the other unless the person attempting the check knows both identities are the same person. Effects that detect you based on your identity work only if you are currently in the identity the effect is trying to detect; otherwise, the effect fails as if the target didn't exist.

To maintain the separation between your identities, some of your abilities have the vigilante trait. Your class feats and vigilante feats are associated with your vigilante identity, and using them while in your social identity may risk exposing you as a vigilante. If your identity is exposed to the public, you lose the benefits of Vigilante Dedication to disguising yourself, but you can spend 1 week of downtime to create a new social identity.

## [[Feats/Hidden Magic|Hidden Magic]] Feat 4

*   archetype
*   skill

You've learned to hide the magical auras of your gear. During your daily preparations, you carefully tweak any or all of your magic items to appear non-magical. Objects adjusted in this way remain so until your next preparations.

A spellcaster using [[Spells/Detect Magic|Detect Magic]] or [[Spells/Read Aura|Read Aura]] must succeed at a Perception check against your Deception DC to see through your obfuscations.

## [[Feats/Minion Guise|Minion Guise]] Feat 4

*   archetype
*   skill
*   social

When you are in your social identity, you can also grant a social identity to an animal companion, familiar, or other minion you gained from a class feature.

When changing to your social identity, you also change your minion's appearance to that of a socially acceptable creature of its type, such as grooming a wolf to appear as a large dog or disguising a familiar to appear as an exotic pet.

Commanding your minion to use unusual magical or combat abilities it gained from your class features or feats while in this social identity risks exposing your vigilante identity.

## [[Feats/Safe House|Safe House]] Feat 4

*   archetype

You establish a safe house-a secure space in which to hide your secrets from the outside world.

This safe house is roughly the size of two 10-foot cubes. It's in a location you have access to, and it can be part of a larger building or structure, like a hidden room or an underground cave.

The safe house protects objects and people inside it from magical detection. This has the effects of [[Spells/Veil of Privacy|Veil of Privacy]], using your Deception modifier for the counteract DC and half your level rounded up for the counteract rank.

Setting up or moving your safe house takes a week of downtime.

The size of the safe house expands to four 10-foot cubes if you're an expert in Deception, eight cubes if you're a master, and 16 cubes if you're legendary.

## [[Feats/Social Purview|Social Purview]] Feat 4

*   archetype

You have built a reputation for yourself in your social identity. Choose one archetype that you meet the prerequisites for. You gain that archetype's dedication feat and can select feats from that archetype, even if you haven't yet gained enough feats in the vigilante archetype to take another dedication feat.

These feats become part of your social identity and gain the social trait-for instance, a fighter vigilante could take the [[Feats/Wizard Dedication|Wizard Dedication]] feat and have a wizard social identity. Using these feats in your social identity doesn't risk exposing your vigilante identity, but using them in your vigilante identity could put you at risk for exposure.

## [[Feats/Startling Appearance (Vigilante)|Startling Appearance (Vigilante)]] Feat 6

*   archetype
*   emotion
*   fear
*   mental
*   vigilante

**Requirements** You are completely unnoticed by the target creature.

* * *

You can startle foes who are unaware of your presence. Make a Strike against your target. That creature is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] against this Strike, as normal. If your Strike hits, the target remains off-guard for the rest of your turn and is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]] (frightened 2 on a critical hit).

## [[Feats/Quick Change|Quick Change]] Feat 7

*   archetype

You can shift between your identities with ease. Instead of spending 1 minute to change your identity, you can now do so as a 3-action activity. If you are legendary in Deception, you can perform this change as a single action.

## [[Feats/Subjective Truth|Subjective Truth]] Feat 7

*   archetype
*   skill

Your disparate identities allow you to defeat magic that detects lies. As long as what you say is true from the point of view of your current identity, you can deceive effects like [[Spells/Ring of Truth|Ring of Truth]] that reveal lies.

## [[Feats/Many Guises (Vigilante)|Many Guises (Vigilante)]] Feat 8

*   archetype

You can take on any number of mundane guises.

Whenever you change your identity, instead of taking on your social or vigilante identity, you can become someone completely ordinary. This identity isn't a specific individual—rather, you become a nondescript member of your ancestry, of any gender, and from a mundane occupation such as common laborer, farmer, or peasant.

Spells and abilities detect you as if you were this ordinary identity, rather than either of your two real identities, unless they succeed at a counteract check against the same Deception DC used for Vigilante Dedication. Using class or dedication abilities ends this disguise.

## [[Feats/Frightening Appearance|Frightening Appearance]] Feat 12

*   archetype

Your dramatic appearances can frighten bystanders.

When you make a Startling Appearance, you can also attempt to [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] each opponent within 10 feet to whom you were unnoticed before your Strike.

_Source: Pathfinder Player Core 2_

## [[Feats/Stunning Appearance|Stunning Appearance]] Feat 16

*   archetype
*   vigilante

Your sudden appearance leaves your foe unable to respond. When you use Startling Appearance, if your foe's level is equal to or lower than yours, they are also [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]] on a hit, or [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 2]] on a critical hit.
