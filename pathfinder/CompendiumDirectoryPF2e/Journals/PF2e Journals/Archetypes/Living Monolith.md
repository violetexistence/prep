# Living Monolith
*   Uncommon

You have delved into ancient sphinx magic to imbue your body and soul with the patience and strength of stone, as you work to create a special magical ka stone to finalize your oaths.

## [[Feats/Living Monolith Dedication|Living Monolith Dedication]] Feat 2

*   Uncommon
*   archetype
*   dedication

**Prerequisites** Ancient Osiriani and Sphinx languages, trained in Crafting

**Access** You are from the Golden Road region.

* * *

You've begun to inscribe a magical stone called a _ka stone_ that you will some day tie to your soul. You gain knowledge of Ancient Osirion and a connection to your nascent _ka stone_. If you fail a recovery check while dying, your dying condition does not increase; if you critically fail, your dying condition increases by only 1. You become trained in Ancient Osirion Lore, or expert if you were already trained.

## [[Feats/Ka Stone Ritual|Ka Stone Ritual]] Feat 4

*   Rare
*   archetype

You inscribe your true name on your _ka stone_, as well as oaths to gods and pharaohs, and embed it in your forehead in a special ritual with a sphinx or with a living monolith who already has this feat. The _ka stone_ is an invested magic item that you automatically invest each day. It can't be removed without your permission, nor can it be dispelled, and you can never lose investiture in the ka stone. Its Bulk is negligible.

The ka stone grants you a +1 item bonus to saves against death effects and negative effects, which increases to +2 at 8th level, +3 at 14th level, and +4 at 20th level.
