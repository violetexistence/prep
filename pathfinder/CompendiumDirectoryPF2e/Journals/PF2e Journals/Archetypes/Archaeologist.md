# Archaeologist
Adventurers raid tombs for material gain, but true archaeologists treasure the knowledge attained from such sites. You might accomplish your goals with scholarly learning, by training to overcome the tricks and traps set by ancient peoples and rivals, through magical training, or even with a bit of inexplicable luck. Many archaeologists practice a combination of all these approaches. Regardless of method, all archaeologists possess a deep desire to learn more about sapient history and prehistory. Adventuring through tombs, dodging traps, and studying magic are all means to better understand ancient sites, analyze artifacts, and decipher the meaning of any remains that can be found from previous inhabitants. You decide how you will uncover the secrets of the past and what to do with the answers you find.
