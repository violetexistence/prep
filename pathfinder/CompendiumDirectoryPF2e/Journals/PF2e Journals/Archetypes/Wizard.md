# Wizard
You have dabbled in the arcane arts and, through discipline and academic study, learned how to cast a few spells.

## [[Feats/Wizard Dedication|Wizard Dedication]] Feat 2

*   archetype
*   dedication
*   multiclass

**Prerequisites** Intelligence +2

* * *

You cast spells like a wizard, gaining a spellbook with four common arcane cantrips of your choice. You gain the [[Actions/Cast a Spell|Cast a Spell]] activity. You can prepare two cantrips each day from your spellbook. You're trained in the spell attack modifier and spell DC statistics. Your key spellcasting attribute for wizard archetype spells is Intelligence, and they are arcane wizard spells. You become trained in Arcana; if you were already trained in Arcana, you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. Select a school; you don't gain any abilities from your choice of school, but qualify for feats as a member.

## [[Feats/Cunning Trickster Mask|Cunning Trickster Mask]] Feat 20

*   Rare
*   archetype
*   druid
*   wizard

Your mask carries the legacy of Verdant Spider, the Speaker of Needs, allowing you to deceive and outwit your foes. You can attempt to [[Actions/Feint|Feint]] a target from up to 30 feet away, and if you succeed or critically succeed in your Feint attempt, the target of your Feint takes a -2 circumstance penalty to saving throws against your spells until the start of your next turn. If you don't have the [[Feats/Conceal Spell|Conceal Spell]] feat, you gain it as a bonus feat, allowing you to disguise your spellcasting from others' eyes. If you already have the Conceal Spell feat, you can use Conceal Spell once per round as a free action instead of as a single action.

Your mask grants you the abilities of Whistling Kite, the Vigilant Seer, who emancipated thousands. When you are attempting a check to free someone else from an effect that immobilizes, paralyzes, or controls them, roll twice and take the higher result; this is a fortune effect. The GM might decide that this fortune effect applies when attempting checks to remove other conditions or effects to free another. Immediately after you Cast a non-cantrip Spell that targets only one creature, you can choose to permit the target to make an attempt to [[Actions/Escape|Escape]].

*   Rare
*   archetype
*   druid

Your mask is infused with restorative magic associated with Ibex, the Flourishing Field, so it constantly repairs itself. You gain fast healing 5. If you lose a limb or other body part, it regrows within 1 day. Immediately after you Cast a non-cantrip Spell that targets only one creature, you can choose to have the spell also give that creature temporary Hit Points equal to the spell's rank until the start of your next turn.

[[Feat_Feature Effects/Effect_ Protective Spirit Mask|Effect: Protective Spirit Mask]]

You also gain the [[Adventure-Specific Actions/Protector's Interdiction|Protector's Interdiction]] reaction.

You must still meet the usual requirements of the action you choose, such as having cover or concealment to Hide and being undetected or [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] to Sneak.

*   druid
*   wizard

Your mask hosts the legacy of Golden Snake, the Tireless Guide, allowing you to guide others with ease. Your allies can use Follow the Expert to follow you for any of your trained skills, in addition to skills in which you are an expert or better. When they follow you when you use a trained skill, their circumstance bonus is +1. Immediately after you Cast a non-cantrip Spell that targets only one ally, that ally can Stride as a free action.

## [[Feats/Vigilant Mask|Vigilant Mask]] Feat 20

*   Rare
*   archetype
*   druid
*   wizard

Your mask grants the extraordinary magical senses of Carmine Jaws, the Hyena who Looks Between. You gain scent as a precise sense to a range of 60 feet. If you already have scent as a precise sense, increase its range by 60 feet. You can sometimes catch a faint whiff of magic itself. Immediately after you Cast a non-cantrip Spell, your scent extends between worlds, like Carmine Jaws's own. This causes you to be able to smell ethereal creatures, those in an extradimensional space with an aperture that's within your scent range, incorporeal creatures and objects, and other creatures and objects that are insubstantial or not fully in phase with reality. Unlike your normal scent, this is an imprecise sense.
