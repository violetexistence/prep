# Jalmeri Heavenseeker
*   Uncommon

Certain martial artists dedicate themselves to fighting in Jalmeray's Challenge of Sky and Heaven. These individuals devote themselves to the esoteric mysteries of the sky.

You can select the dedication feat for the Jalmeri Heavenseeker archetype even if you haven't yet gained three feats from the [[PF2e Journals/Archetypes/Student of Perfection|Student of Perfection]] archetype.

## [[Feats/Jalmeri Heavenseeker Dedication|Jalmeri Heavenseeker Dedication]] Feat 4

*   archetype
*   dedication

**Prerequisites** Student of Perfection Dedication, or you've trained with a champion of the Challenge of Sky and Heaven

* * *

You become trained in either Acrobatics or Occultism; if you were already trained in both these skills, you become an expert in one of them instead. You gain either the [[Feats/Qi Spells|Qi Spells]] or [[Feats/Qi Spells|Qi Spells]] monk feat, which grants you a ki spell and a focus pool of 1 Focus Point that you can recover using the Refocus activity as a monk does. If you already have both feats, you can instead choose a single 1st‐level monk feat.

* * *

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you gain two other feats from the Jalmeri Heavenseeker or [[PF2e Journals/Archetypes/Student of Perfection|Student of Perfection]] archetypes.

## [[Feats/Heaven's Thunder|Heaven's Thunder]] Feat 6

*   archetype
*   electricity
*   sonic

Until the end of your next turn, your unarmed attacks and any monk weapons you wield deal additional electricity and sonic damage; the amount of each damage type is equal to the number of damage dice for the weapon or unarmed attack. Any creature who successfully [[Actions/Grapple|Grapples]] you or is successfully Grappled by you takes this damage immediately after the Grapple check is resolved (using the number of damage dice of your unarmed attack to determine the damage dealt).

If you also know the [[Spells/Qi Blast|Ki Blast]] ki spell, you can choose to deal either electricity or sonic damage with the spell instead of force while this effect is active (_ki blast_ loses the force trait and gains the electricity or sonic trait instead).

Each attack counts toward your multiple attack penalty, but the multiple attack penalty doesn't increase until after you've made all your attacks. Instead of the usual slashing or piercing damage, the damage for these Strikes is either electricity or sonic, as you choose with each Strike. If you successfully hit with all three Strikes, the target is [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 3]].
