# Knight Vigilant
*   Uncommon

Taking their lead from heroic stories of the Shining Crusade, the knights vigilant stand as a courageous example of morality and honor.

## Knights of Lastwall Archetypes

The following archetypes are uncommon but are available to members of the Knights of Lastwall. Qualifying characters with the Lastwall sentry archetype can select one of these dedications even without gaining three feats from the Lastwall sentry archetype, and each of these archetypes' feats fulfills the [[Feats/Lastwall Sentry Dedication|Lastwall Sentry Dedication]]'s special requirement despite not being from the Lastwall sentry archetype.

## [[Feats/Knight Vigilant Dedication|Knight Vigilant Dedication]] Feat 6

*   dedication

**Prerequisites** trained in Religion, any good alignment, member of the Knights of Lastwall of knight rank

* * *

You are dedicated to the cause of the Shining Sentinels. You gain expert proficiency in Religion. When you are between an ally and a foe and would provide lesser cover to your ally against the foe's attacks, you twist to become even more obtrusive, providing standard cover instead.

## [[Feats/Unshakable Idealism|Unshakable Idealism]] Feat 8

## [[Feats/Emissary of Peace|Emissary of Peace]] Feat 10

*   archetype

Even when bloodshed is inevitable, you would rather see your foes surrender. You attempt a Diplomacy check to [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] against a single foe whose Hit Points are at less than half of their maximum value, followed by an immediate Request to convince that creature to cease fighting. You take a -5 penalty to your Diplomacy check. The GM sets the DC of the Request based on the circumstances; it's generally at least a very hard DC for the creature's level. Some creatures might simply refuse, and those who agree to parley might find your arguments lacking and start fighting again.

## [[Feats/Instant Armor|Instant Armor]] Feat 10

*   archetype

A knight is nothing without their armor, and you know how to keep yours ready. You can perform a 10-minute ritual, which has the conjuration and magical traits, to divert a set of heavy armor you are wearing into an extradimensional space connected to you. While the armor is in this space, you can use a three-action activity, which has the concentrate, conjuration, and teleportation traits, to phase the armor back and instantly don it. The armor automatically phases away if you don another set of armor, if you become [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]], or if you die. If you are incapable of wearing the armor when it phases back, it appears in your square instead.

Armor you polish shines with righteous grace. You can take 10 minutes to recite prayers or oaths while polishing a suit of heavy armor that you or a willing creature is wearing.

Additionally, the creature wearing the polished armor gains an additional reaction at the start of each of their turns that can be only used for this reaction.

**Success** As critical success, but the creature wearing the polished armor doesn't gain an additional reaction at the start of each of their turns.
