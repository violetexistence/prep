# Mammoth Lord
*   Uncommon

The Kellid people of the far north are collectively known as the Mammoth Lords, but this name is something of a generalization. True Mammoth Lords are rare champions, heroes among their people who have tamed a mammoth, cave bear, triceratops, or other megafauna. They often ride these enormous creatures into battle. Astride their mighty steeds, Mammoth Lords lead their followings along migratory routes they've used for generations, and they defend their people from frost giants, white dragons, and many other perils of the far north.

You're one of these legendary heroes, a true Mammoth Lord. You've captured or befriended one of the megafauna of the far north and tamed it. This heroic deed is best done as part of an adventure, but if that isn't possible, work with your GM to determine the details of how you managed to make one of these tremendous creatures your companion. You now ride this fantastic beast into battle, fighting from atop its back.

| What Counts as Megafauna? |
| --- |
| The megafauna of the Realm of the Mammoth Lords are enormous beasts of intimidating appearance, but they can be hard to otherwise classify. While the most well-known megafauna are mammals—like the mammoth or the woolly rhinoceros—not all are. Large dinosaurs like the stegosaurus and triceratops qualify as megafauna, for example, but smaller dinosaurs like raptors don't. A list of well-established megafauna can be found below, but it isn't an exclusive list; other, more unusual, species might be permitted with GM approval. One rule is certain, however: an adult megafauna is always Large or bigger.<br/>**Cave Bear**: Use a bear's statistics for a cave bear animal companion.<br/>**Daeodon**: Use a boar's statistics for a daeodon, or giant boar, companion.<br/>**Dire Wolf**: Use a wolf's statistics for a dire wolf companion.<br/>**Mammoth**: Use a elephant's statistics for the statistics for an elephant or woolly mammoth animal companion.<br/>**Roc**: Use bird statistics for a young roc.<br/>**Smilodon**: Use cat statistics for a smilodon animal companion.<br/>**Triceratops**: Use triceratops statistics for a triceratops or other armored dinosaur, such as a stegosaurus or ankylosaurus.<br/>**Tyrannosaurus**: Use tyrannosaurus statistics for for a tyrannosaurus, allosaurus, or similar dinosaur.<br/>**Woolly Rhinoceros**: Use rhinoceros statistics for a rhinoceros or woolly rhinoceros animal companion. |

**MAMMOTH LORD ANIMAL COMPANIONS**

If you're playing a mammoth lord, you determine the statistics and abilities of your animal companions according to the basic rules for animal companions. As a mammoth lord, it's possible for you to have more than one animal companion at one time—up to four companions—but only one of those companions, your "active companion," follows you during exploration and in encounters; the rest are nearby, usually foraging or hunting for food. As soon as you gain a second animal companion from the mammoth lord archetype, you also gain [[Actions/Call Companion|Call Companion]] to switch your active companion. These rules apply to all your companions, regardless of whether you got the animal companion from the mammoth lord archetype or from another source.

## [[Feats/Mammoth Lord Dedication|Mammoth Lord Dedication]] Feat 4

*   Uncommon
*   archetype
*   dedication

**Prerequisites** Ride

* * *

You've undertaken the ultimate challenge of the Mammoth Lords and tamed a megafauna. You gain a megafauna you tamed as a young animal companion. Your megafauna animal companion must be a megafauna appropriate to the Realm of the Mammoth Lords;. While an animal companion usually starts as Small, you can begin with a Medium version of that animal (changing no statistics other than its size).

Contrary to the usual rules for animal companions, this feat can give you a second animal companion. If you have more than one animal companion, you can adventure with only one of them at a time. You can switch between them like a beastmaster does. You gain the Call Companion action, as the beastmaster archetype, and you follow all the other rules found in the [[Actions/Call Companion|Call Companion]] sidebar; see [[PF2e Journals/Archetypes/Beastmaster Dedication|Beastmaster Dedication]] for details on this action and the rules for multiple companions.

## [[Feats/Megafauna Veterinarian|Megafauna Veterinarian]] Feat 6

*   archetype
*   skill

By heeding the wise advice of elders in your following- and aided by your own experience-you've learned how to provide medical care to the megafauna of the Mammoth Lord followings. You can attempt a Nature check instead of a Medicine check for any of Medicine's trained and untrained uses, provided the subject of your medical care is a megafauna. If you're attempting an action that requires a particular proficiency rank in Medicine (such as [[Actions/Treat Wounds|Treat Wounds]]), use your proficiency rank in Nature instead. If the subject of your care is your megafauna and you roll a success on your check, you get a critical success instead.

## [[Feats/Unbreakable Bond|Unbreakable Bond]] Feat 10

*   archetype

You and your megafauna companion are bound together; as long as you live, it's much harder for your companion to die.

Additionally, your megafauna companion only dies at dying 5 rather than dying 4. Finally, the first time each day your megafauna companion would reach dying 5 and die, as long as you're still alive, your companion's dying value decreases to 0 instead.
