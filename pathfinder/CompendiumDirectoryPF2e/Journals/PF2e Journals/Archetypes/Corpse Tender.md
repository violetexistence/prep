# Corpse Tender
*   Uncommon

You tend to mindless undead, such as the zombie farmhands and farm animals throughout Geb.

## [[Feats/Corpse Tender Dedication|Corpse Tender Dedication]] Feat 2

*   Uncommon
*   archetype
*   dedication

**Prerequisites** evil alignment, trained in Religion

* * *

You have a connection to mindless undead that allows you to communicate your intentions to them on a rudimentary level. You can use Diplomacy to [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] on mindless undead and to make very simple [[Actions/Request|Requests]] of them; their mindless trait doesn't grant immunity to these mental effects. Most mindless undead are likely hostile toward you by default and must be kept at a safe distance to give you time to Make an Impression.

You become trained in Diplomacy; if already trained, you instead become trained in another skill of your choice.

## [[Feats/Command Corpse|Command Corpse]] Feat 4

*   Uncommon
*   archetype

You gain the [[Feats/Command Undead|Command Undead]] feat, but you can use it only to transform the effects of [[Spells/Harm|Harm]] spells you cast on mindless undead. These spells can control creatures with a level equal to or lower than your level -1 (instead of your level - 3).

## [[Feats/Improved Command Corpse|Improved Command Corpse]] Feat 8

*   Uncommon
*   archetype

When you use [[Feats/Command Undead|Command Undead]] on a mindless undead, if the undead succeeds at its save but doesn't critically succeed, it becomes your minion for 1 round. If the undead fails its save, it becomes your minion for 1 hour. If it critically fails, it becomes your minion for 24 hours.

## [[Feats/Imbue Mindlessness|Imbue Mindlessness]] Feat 12

*   Uncommon
*   archetype

You grasp the mind of an undead creature and temporarily wipe it as empty as a zombie's brain. You can target any undead with your divine innate [[Spells/Harm|Harm]] spell, not just mindless undead. When you target one non-mindless undead creature with this spell, you can transform its effects. Instead of harm's normal effects, the target must attempt a Will save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target is [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] for 1 round.

**Failure** The target is [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] for 1 minute. While it is stupefied, you can use your Corpse Tender feats on the target as though it were mindless.

**Critical Failure** As failure, except the target is [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 3]] for 10 minutes.
