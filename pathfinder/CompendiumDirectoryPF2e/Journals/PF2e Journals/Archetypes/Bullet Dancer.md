# Bullet Dancer
*   Uncommon

While most monastic orders and traditional fighting schools shun firearms as loud and unreliable technology for unskilled conscripts, you fuse flourishing feints and ricocheting gunplay into a whirling ballet of bullets. As a bullet dancer, you might become the target of brash duelists and gladiators looking to make a name for themselves. But you tend to welcome the attention and might have proven your reputation while dancing your deadly ballet in tournaments from Tymon to Goka. You've found your fluid motions and explosive attacks to be surefire crowd-pleasers, even as they serve to confound and shock your foes.

## [[Feats/Bullet Dancer Dedication|Bullet Dancer Dedication]] Feat 2

*   Uncommon
*   archetype
*   dedication

**Prerequisites** expert in unarmored defense

* * *

You mix guns and melee into a deadly art. You gain the Bullet Dancer Stance action. You are also granted familiarity with bayonets, reinforced stocks, martial firearms, and martial combination weapons; for the purposes of proficiency and abilities from this archetype, you treat bayonets, reinforced stocks, martial firearms, and martial combination weapons as simple weapons. You gain access to uncommon combination weapons that have a firearm ranged form.

**Bullet Dancer Stance** `pf2:1` (stance)

**Requirements** You're unarmored and wielding a simple firearm or simple combination weapon

* * *

**Effect** You enter a specialized stance for a unique martial art centered around the use of simple firearms. While in this stance, the only Strikes you can make are those using bayonets, reinforced stocks, simple firearms, and simple combination weapons. You can use [[Actions/Flurry of Blows|Flurry of Blows]] with these weapons. You can use other monk feats or monk abilities you have that normally require unarmed attacks with bayonets, reinforced stocks, and the melee component of simple combination weapons, so long as the feat or ability doesn't require a single, specific Strike. You can also use them with simple firearms when attacking within half the first range increment.

## [[Feats/Bullet Dancer Burn|Bullet Dancer Burn]] Feat 4

*   archetype

**Requirements** You're wielding a simple combination weapon or an attached bayonet or reinforced stock.

* * *

The fiery blaze of your weapon shocks your enemies. While in [[Actions/Bullet Dancer Stance|Bullet Dancer Stance]], when you successfully Strike an opponent with the melee form of a combination weapon or a bayonet or reinforced stock attached to a simple firearm, the next ranged Strike you make against that opponent doesn't trigger reactions that would trigger on a ranged attack, such as Reactive Strike. While in Bullet Dancer Stance, when you make a successful ranged Strike against an opponent within your melee reach using a firearm, the next melee attack against that opponent with that weapon or a weapon attached to it deals an additional 1 fire damage and 1 persistent fire damage per weapon damage die of the attached firearm.

The benefit on your next Strike from either use of Bullet Dancer Burn is lost if not used by the end of your next turn.

* * *

**Special** If you have [[Feats/Bullet Dancer Burn|Bullet Dancer Burn]], apply the additional fire damage to the granted Strike.

*   archetype
*   flourish

**Requirements** You're in [[Actions/Bullet Dancer Stance|Bullet Dancer Stance]].

* * *

You've learned to reload your firearms with uncanny grace, the ammunition simply falling into place as though part of a well-practiced kata. You Strike with a simple firearm, and then Interact to reload that same firearm. You don't need a free hand to reload your weapon in this way.

## [[Feats/Ranged Disarm|Ranged Disarm]] Feat 14

*   archetype

**Requirements** You're wielding a simple firearm or simple combination weapon.

* * *

When using a simple firearm, you can shoot objects right out of your enemy's hands. Attempt to [[Actions/Disarm|Disarm]] the target using a ranged attack roll with the required firearm or combination weapon, instead of attempting an Athletics check against the target's Reflex DC.
