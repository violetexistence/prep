# Campfire Chronicler
*   Uncommon

You follow in the footsteps of Isthralei, an old god of Sarkoris dedicated to protecting and assisting travelers in return for a story of their journey. Though tales of Isthralei himself are scarce, his gifts are still sometimes given to those who protect travelers and collect their stories.

This tradition of chronicling, relearned from the ghost of a Sarkorian storyteller, has flourished at the Academy of the Reclamation. Many students who enter the Sarkoris Scar now travel under Isthralei's name, both believing in the god's purpose and using his rediscovery as a symbol of the Reclamation's successes. Even that may be too small a scope, however, as travelers' tales come from far and wide. Many campfire chroniclers collect stories of other students who have returned to Sarkoris from afar, along with the stories of their families who were scattered following the opening of the Worldwound.

The mysterious benefactor accepts all stories with a listening ear, leading to many late night discussions among students about what truths might be hidden in tall tales and outright fabrications. Although Isthralei accepts falsehoods without comment, he places no requirement on the chroniclers to do the same. In fact, Isthralei has yet to provide guidance beyond the comforting warmth of his protection after stories are offered.

Although Sarkorian traditions don't place importance on dividing their gods by power level or origin, some at the Academy of the Reclamation have begun to dig deeper into each of the gods' individual circumstances. The question of where Isthralei came from has become a particularly popular one among students who hope that a god who so loves the stories of travelers wouldn't take offense at his own story being exposed.

Students prying into these matters have found some success using magical sources of information. Most recently, Cobyslarni's Echo Repository has revealed several tales of travelers and explorers who encountered a smiling figure far from any habitation. The reoccurring theme of weary travelers being offered a space next to the campfire in exchange for their tales has led several students to suggest that the wanderer is actually Isthralei. Unfortunately, the sightings are so vastly spread—occurring between continents, in the First World of the fey, or even on elemental planes—that they've provided little illumination of the god's origins.

At the academy, Isthralei's philosophy has expanded to include tenets to protect travelers' freedom of movement, be generous to others when possible, and seek wisdom in the experience of others. Although these aren't strictly necessary to gain or keep Isthralei's favor, it's difficult to find a teacher among the Academy of the Reclamation without agreeing to these tenets.

This philosophy of protecting travelers is generally seen to include the Convocation's guests in Nerosyan. Isthralei's campfire chroniclers are among the most obvious representatives of their academy and the Convocation as a whole. Although surviving tales of the old god inspire campfire conversations on the exhibit grounds, his followers also listen to stories in bars, cafes, and the schools' lodgings.

New campfire chroniclers are inundated with the stories of the ghosts below Pulura's Fall and the lessons learned there. You have resistance equal to your level to spirit and void damage caused by a haunt, spirit, or incorporeal undead. The first time you take damage from a haunt or spirit, you learn the general story of its origin (such as the type of tragedy that caused a ghost to linger or what a spirit represents).

## [[Feats/Cozy Campfire|Cozy Campfire]] Feat 6

*   archetype
*   consecration
*   divine
*   exploration
*   fire

You spend 1 hour building a campfire in a single unoccupied square and whispering the stories of those you've met on your journeys. The campfire sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius (and dim light for the next 30 feet). The campfire can't be put out or get larger through mundane means; it instead burns out after your next daily preparations or when you use this ability again.

The first time each round a creature within the campfire's bright light performs an action with the attack trait, they must then attempt a `Will check` save against your class DC or spell DC (whichever is higher). This is a divine curse effect, and you are aware of any attempt, although other creatures in the area are not.

Stories serve as beacons in the night, illuminating valuable knowledge even if the tale itself misses the mark. When you [[Actions/Offer Story|Offer a Story]] about any topic, you can choose that illumination in place of the normal benefits of Offer Story.

The creature you share a story with can choose this benefit even if you did not.

The bonus increases to +2 if you are a master of Religion and +3 if you are legendary.

## [[Feats/Flickering Stories|Flickering Stories]] Feat 8

*   archetype
*   divine

Stories, like fires, can create shadows as much as they illuminate. When you Offer a Story, you can become [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] by shifting shadows for the duration instead of the normal benefits. The action then gains the shadow trait. You can't use this concealment to [[Actions/Hide|Hide]], as normal for concealing effects that leave your location obvious. The creature you share a story with can choose this benefit even if you did not.
