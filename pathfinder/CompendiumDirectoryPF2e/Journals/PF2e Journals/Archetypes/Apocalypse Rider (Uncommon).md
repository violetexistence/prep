# Apocalypse Rider (Uncommon)
*   Uncommon

From the mightiest empire to the smallest star, everything dies. Lowly mortals, ageless angels, and primordial gods all face the same inescapable fate—to fade beyond memory and join the litany of the forgotten. The hastening of all life into this oblivion is the ultimate goal of the daemonic harbingers and their forces, including those mortals who exploit hate and hopelessness to bring calamity on the world. Chief among these demigods are the Riders of the Apocalypse, powerful fiends chosen to deliver death, famine, pestilence, and war.

While neither the Riders nor their devotees feel obligated to make or keep promises, some mortals pledge their efforts to gain personal power and further the cause of entropy. Those destined to wreak the most destruction upon the world are known as apocalypse riders. Taking on such a mantle requires the utmost commitment to death and ruin.

You are such an apocalypse rider, and you have a terrifying ally in this fight, whether sent by daemonic overlords or spontaneously formed by Abaddon itself. This creature is a beastly mount with a form that matches your personality and goals, though its loyalties lie with Abaddon first. It will serve you faithfully as long as you continue to cause significant losses of life and inflict mass destruction. However, this apocalypse mount is more than just a way to monitor your obedience to the cause of misery. Your mount serves as a badge of office, signifying to daemons that you are effectively one of them.

From astride her ferocious riding drake, **Arba Dwindletree** (destructive female gnome druid) staves off her Bleaching by wreaking havoc on crops and pitting fledgling settlements in the River Kingdoms against one another. Her delight in this chaos is tempered only when meddlesome fey creatures try to join in on the “fun.”

Posing as an Order of the Nail Hellknight, **Owyn Darkoath** (manipulative male human warrior) pushes border tensions between Andoran and Cheliax, riding a pitch black destrier into battle. His goal is to force default on the Thrunes' contract with Hell, bringing even greater war when Asmodeus' forces come to collect what they're owed.

**Deng Fo-Murk** (cruel male human necromancer) uses his alchemical skills to reanimate the corpses of nobles and diplomats to sew political conflict between Hwanggot and its neighbors. He is poised to light the fuse on a powder keg of bloody consequences, through which he will gallop through on his terror bird mount.

In Abaddon, daemonkind sometimes demonstrates an odd mix of cooperation and hostility toward one another. This remains true of their mortal champions in the Universe. War creates both famine and pestilence, drought creates war, and all worshippers of the end of all things engineer death in one form or another. An apocalypse rider may specialize in a particular rubric of death, but all daemonic servitors understand that the categories of the Four Riders frequently overlap one another. A group of riders might even cooperate to increase the scale of their deadly designs, but their apocalypse mounts carefully track who is delivering on their oath and who is not.

Apocalypse riders who fulfill the full scope of their commitment to the Riders often prove to be among the mightiest creatures on their world. Such servants of death are hardly sated once a project reaches its desired number of casualties. Successful riders often indulge in a new sort of killing or initiate a plan larger and more lethal in scope than their original commitments. A truly ambitious apocalypse rider will turn their baleful gaze to their own master, enforcing one of the few dogmas observed by daemonkind—all creatures must die, including those immortal demigods who remain unchallenged for too many centuries. Several times over the millennia, an apocalypse rider or exalted deacon has laid waste to a presiding Rider and claimed the daemon's post. An individual who assumes the office of Rider immediately becomes a unique daemon and takes over the realm of the previous Rider on the plane of Abaddon.

  

| Your Personal Apocalypse |
| --- |
| Often your apocalypse mount brings with it a command to start a war or drive a nation to lasting hunger, but the Four Riders of the Apocalypse and their daemonic servants leave the nature of the calamity to you, their new champion. The daemons demand only that the resulting evil be historic in scope and unique in its nature. All mortals can start a war by virtue of hatred or greed; an apocalypse rider's war must offer something new. Apocalypse riders often demonstrate a significant degree of finesse as they engineer destruction. Servants of the Rider of Famine might employ magic to control the weather, breed a more voracious swarm of locusts, poison the soil or a city's water supply, or employ economics to hoard a food supply away from hungry mouths. Each Rider's promise offers multiple opportunities to bring calamity to bear, and every apocalypse rider has full authority to shape events for their desired effect. |

## [[Feats/Apocalypse Rider Dedication|Apocalypse Rider Dedication]] Feat 12

*   Uncommon
*   destiny
*   mythic

In the darkest hour of the night, a fearsome and terrible steed arrives as a gift from a powerful daemonic patron. You gain an apocalypse mount, which is loyal and follows your commands as long as you work to spread death and destruction. Your apocalypse mount can be any mature animal companion with the mount special ability, though it is obviously touched by daemonic forces. Choose whether your apocalypse mount is a nimble or savage animal companion. During an encounter, even if you don't use the Command an Animal action, your apocalypse mount can still use 1 action on your turn to Stride or Strike.

You also gain the anathema "You forswear any plans to cheat death or build something that will last beyond your own death." If you break this anathema, you lose access to abilities granted by this archetype until you atone or make amends.

* * *

**Special** If you already have an animal companion with the mount special ability, it becomes your apocalypse mount as daemonic energies infuse its form. In such a case, one of your companion's unarmed attacks increases one die size.

## [[Feats/History of Violence|History of Violence]] Feat 14

*   mythic
*   void

**Frequency** once per 10 minutes

* * *

Your attacks bring with them echoes of previous battles, calling the unquiet victims of your most brutal acts to savage your opponents. Make a Strike. If this Strike hits, you deal additional void damage equal to your key attribute modifier to the target and all enemies within 30 feet. If your attack is a critical hit, you deal twice as much damage instead, and the target of your Strike takes persistent void damage equal to your key attribute modifier as your fallen foes attempt to drag the target into oblivion with them. This Strike counts as two attacks for calculating your multiple attack penalty.

Choose a number of potions or alchemical elixirs within the area equal to your key attribute modifier and attempt a counteract against each of them using `Occultism check` or `Religion check` at mythic proficiency.

You inspire your allies to greater battle prowess while trampling enemies in your way. You Command your apocalypse mount to Stride up to twice its Speed (or to Burrow, Climb, Fly, or Swim, if it has the corresponding movement type), moving through the space of any foes in your path up to one size smaller than your apocalypse mount.

On a critical failure, the creature also becomes [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the end of your next turn. You can damage a given creature only once during this movement.

In addition, all allies who witnessed your charge gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to your level and a +2 status bonus to damage against any foe damaged by your apocalypse mount this round. This has the visual trait. These benefits last until the end of your next turn.

## [[Feats/Memory of Nothing|Memory of Nothing]] Feat 18

## [[Feats/Soul Vessel Mount|Soul Vessel Mount]] Feat 18

*   mythic

Your mount has a supernatural hunger for mortal souls that you can feed. Once per day, you can cast [[Spells/Seize Soul|Seize Soul]] as a divine innate spell. The spell gains a cost of 1 Mythic Point but you can use your apocalypse mount as the item in which you store the soul. Your apocalypse mount counts as an artifact for the purpose of the spell. At any point while your apocalypse mount contains a soul, you can Sustain the spell to allow your apocalypse mount to consume the soul. It regains a number of Hit Points equal to twice your level. For the next minute, it also gains a +20-foot status bonus to its Speed and its unarmed attack Strikes are made at mythic proficiency.

## [[Feats/Immortal Ruin|Immortal Ruin]] Feat 20

*   mythic

Your commitment to ending all life earns you a measure of immortality, setting the stage for you to become a true Rider of the Apocalypse, possibly supplanting one of the Four. You gain the daemon, fiend, and unholy traits, and so does your apocalypse mount, but your fates are ever more entwined. As long as your apocalypse mount lives, you don't age and whenever your [[Conditions/Doomed|Doomed]] or [[Conditions/Dying|Dying]] condition would increase to 4 or more, it doesn't increase. If you would be killed in any other way, you are instead reduced to 0 Hit Points, become [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]], and if your apocalypse mount is conscious, it instantly teleports to your side, picks you up, and attempts to flee the scene of danger.

While you are conscious and within 30 feet of your apocalypse mount, it can't be killed. If your apocalypse mount is reduced to 0 Hit Points, it immediately stabilizes and its dying condition can't increase. If its doomed condition would increase to 4 or more, it doesn't increase. However, if you move more than 30 feet away from your apocalypse mount or go [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]] during this time, your apocalypse mount loses these benefits and might die.

Finally, when a living creature within 60 feet of you dies, it must attempt a `Will check` saving throw against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. This is an incapacitation effect. On a failure, that creature can't be brought back to life for 24 hours. On a critical failure, you can chose to have that creature's soul coalesce into a fist-sized soul gem (Hardness 2, HP 8) that appears in that creature's space. That creature's soul is trapped within the gem for 1 week, though you can make the gem permanent with a 10-minute ritual. Destroying the gem frees the soul within but doesn't return the deceased creature to life. If a caster attempts to return to life a creature whose soul is trapped within a soul gem, they fail unless they succeed at a `Religion check` check against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. A success causes the soul gem to shatter, allowing the creature to be returned to life as normal for the spell. Daemons and other fiends prize these soul gems, and they're generally worth an amount relative to the level of a gem's captive soul.
