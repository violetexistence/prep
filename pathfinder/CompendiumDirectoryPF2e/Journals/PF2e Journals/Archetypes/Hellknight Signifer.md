# Hellknight Signifer
*   Uncommon

Signifers are the powerful and enigmatic Hellknight spellcasters who support and sometimes lead other Hellknights on their missions to enforce unwavering law. Formidable in their own right, signifers are trained to be unstoppable forces of order and authority when they stand alongside their martial counterparts.

## Hellknight Archetypes

The following archetypes represent fully inducted members of a Hellknight order. You can select the dedication feats for these archetypes even if you haven't yet gained three feats from the [[Compendium.pf2e.journals.JournalEntry.vx5FGEG34AxI2dow.JournalEntryPage.ARYrFIOsT3JxpjDY]] archetype. A character can't have both the [[Compendium.pf2e.journals.JournalEntry.vx5FGEG34AxI2dow.JournalEntryPage.yWtwNUkGyj79Q04W]] and Hellknight signifer archetypes.

You gain expert proficiency in Intimidation (or in another skill in which you're trained of your choice, if you were already an expert in Intimidation) as well as in your choice of Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion.
