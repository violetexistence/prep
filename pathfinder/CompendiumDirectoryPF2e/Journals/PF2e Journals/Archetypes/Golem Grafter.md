# Golem Grafter
*   Uncommon

You have replaced a portion of your body with artifice of the kind used to create golems, fortifying your flesh with the unyielding might of magical constructs.

*   dedication

**Prerequisites** expert in Arcana and Crafting, or an ally with expert proficiency in those skills willing to augment you

* * *

Your flesh has been specially treated with the same arcane and alchemical processes used to toughen the skin of flesh golems. Increase your maximum Hit Points by an amount equal to your level. You gain resistance to physical damage (except adamantine) equal to your number of class feats from the golem grafter archetype.

## [[Feats/Accursed Clay Fist|Accursed Clay Fist]] Feat 10

*   archetype
*   curse

You have replaced one of your forearms with one made of clay and infused with cursed arcane magic. When you make an unarmed Strike with your clay fist and hit, your target takes a -2 status penalty to saving throws against curse effects for 1 hour.

**Special** The damage die for your clay fist is 1d8, and it loses the agile and finesse traits of a typical fist.
