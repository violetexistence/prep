# Weapon Improviser
As far as you're concerned, the best weapon to wield is the one that your opponents never see coming. By knowing how to fight effectively with whatever is at hand, you ensure that you're never caught unarmed, and you often get the drop on opponents who mistakenly think they've caught you unprepared.

Whether you're smashing someone over the head with a barstool, tossing a mug of ale in their face to blind them, or stabbing your foes with a broken bottle, you can find weapons anywhere and employ them creatively whenever a brawl breaks out. Because you fight with disposable weapons, you don't need handle them with care as other warriors do, and you can break them when needed to win a fight without feeling any regrets later.

**IMPROVISED WEAPON IDEAS:** Use these for inspiration.

Cavern: broken stalagmites, large mushrooms, old bones

Docks: barrel, crate, hook

Forest: branch, needles or thorns

Market: box, fruit, scale, sign

Noble Court: gavel, goblet, quill, lectern

Tavern: bottle, mug, serving tray, stool

**GM Advice** For a GM setting damage, typically a one-handed improvised weapon's damage is 1d4, 1d6, or 1d8; one that needs two hands is 1d8, 1d10, or occasionally 1d12, and an extremely ineffective one might deal 1 damage. Improvised weapons typically have zero, one, or two traits, and often have the nonlethal trait. Agile improvised weapons usually have a smaller die size. It's extremely rare for an improvised weapon to deal more than one die of damage, but powerful magical objects might. Improvised weapons should be fun and don't last long, so feel free to experiment!

## [[Feats/Improvised Pummel|Improvised Pummel]] Feat 4

*   archetype

When you make a Strike with an improvised weapon you're wielding, you gain a +1 item bonus to the attack roll, and you can have the Strike deal two weapon damage dice instead of the improvised weapon's normal number. If the attack is a critical hit, the improvised weapon breaks after the normal effects of a critical hit occur. If the item has a Hardness greater than your level, or if it's an artifact, cursed item, or other item that's difficult to break or destroy, it doesn't break but the attack is a normal hit instead of a critical hit. You can choose not to get any of the effects of Improvised Pummel on a Strike if you don't want to risk breaking the item. At 12th level, the item bonus increases to +2, and at 16th level, the Strike deals three weapon damage dice instead of the improvised weapon's normal number.

If you're benefiting from [[Equipment/Handwraps of Mighty Blows|Handwraps of Mighty Blows]], you use the handwraps' item bonus if it's higher and can choose to use its number of damage dice. Any property runes from the handwraps also apply if you use the handwraps' number of weapon damage dice, provided they could apply to the improvised weapon (as determined by the GM).
