# Razmiran Priest
*   Uncommon

You are a Razmiran priest, initiated in the 31 Steps, the doctrines of Razmir's religion. You were trained at the Exalted Lodge or another of the temples where the priests specialize in crafting masks that also serve as Razmir's religious symbol, and you are charged with spreading and enforcing Razmir's faith. Razmiran priests are zealous worshippers of their god and use the magical techniques that they are taught to spread his word and his will. You have placed service to the Living God above all other duties and entrusted your wealth, prosperity, and ambitions to his teachings, while availing yourself of the knowledge and wisdom that only his most blessed servants are ever bestowed with, accepting the power and authority that is the right of the Living God's priests. Perhaps this is a pure zealousness, or perhaps you are motivated by Razmir's promises of wealth and authority. Either way, you have donned the mask and wield the power reserved for those who follow in Razmir's footsteps.

## [[Feats/Razmiran Priest Dedication|Razmiran Priest Dedication]] Feat 2

*   Uncommon
*   archetype
*   dedication

**Prerequisites** trained in Crafting, trained in Deception

* * *

You have earned entry to the priesthood of Razmir, either at the Exalted Lodge or another temple where Razmir's holy masks are forged. You gain a [[Equipment/Razmiri Mask|Razmiri Mask]] and can Craft a replacement in 4 hours if yours is ever damaged or lost. There is no value in selling your _Razmiri mask_, and only you gain its benefits. The abilities of your _Razmiri mask_ use the higher of your class DC or spell DC.

You can take the [[Feats/Cleric Dedication|Cleric Dedication]] feat without needing to meet its prerequisites and before you take two other feats from the Razmiran priest archetype, but you must choose Razmir as your deity. All spells granted by the cleric archetype when gained in this way are occult spells instead of divine spells, and cleric feats that normally have the divine trait instead have the occult trait. Your key spellcasting attribute for these spells is Charisma, rather than Wisdom.

## [[Feats/Perfect Truths|Perfect Truths]] Feat 6

*   archetype

Your knowledge of Razmir's faith and doctrines has grown. You excel in debating priests of rival faiths, wielding truths as subtly and deftly as any charlatan might wield a lie. When you use Deception to [[Actions/Lie|Lie]], you can carefully structure your deceits so that each individual statement you make is the truth, from a certain perspective.

As long as you are wearing your [[Equipment/Razmiri Mask|Razmiri Mask]], you don't take a penalty to Deception checks while subject to the [[Spells/Ring of Truth|Ring of Truth]] spell or similar effects. Whenever you are subject to _ring of truth_ or a similar effect, you can attempt a `Deception check` check when you first begin speaking to counteract the spell's effects, with a counteract rank equal to half your level (rounded up); succeeding at this check doesn't end the spell or effect, but it does cause it to indicate that you are speaking the truth, even when you are actually lying, as you weave a web of words so delicate that even you can't be certain where the truth ends and deception begins.

## [[Feats/Mask of the 12th Step|Mask of the 12th Step]] Feat 10

*   archetype

You have reached the 12th Step and been instructed in greater secrets of Razmir's doctrine. You can Craft your [[Equipment/Razmiri Mask|Razmiri Mask]] out of silver or upgrade your existing mask to a silver one in the same time it takes to Craft one made of iron. A [[Equipment/Razmiri Mask (Silver)|Silver Razmiri Mask]] grants a +2 item bonus to Deception checks to [[Actions/Lie|Lie]] or [[Actions/Feint|Feint]], is a 10th-level item, and gains the following activation in addition to that possessed by the standard mask.

* * *

**Activate—Call Upon Razmir's Mercy** `pf2:2` (concentrate, manipulate, occult)

**Frequency** three times per day

**Effect** Exhorting Razmir to purge impurities from your target, you lay hands on a creature within reach and cast [[Spells/Cleanse Affliction|Cleanse Affliction]] as an occult spell with a spell rank equal to half your level. Unlike a normal _cleanse affliction_ spell, this doesn't reduce the stage of the affliction; instead, if the counteract check is successful, the affliction's stage is temporarily reduced by 1 and its effects are suppressed for 24 hours, after which the affliction resumes in full force. If the target would have been required to attempt additional saves against the affliction during the 24 hours it was suppressed, they must attempt all of those saving throws as soon as the 24-hour duration ends. This could mean that the target saves successfully and it is as if the affliction were truly healed, or it could mean that the affliction returns and advances multiple stages all at once.

## [[Feats/Mask of the 15th Step|Mask of the 15th Step]] Feat 14

*   archetype

You have ascended to the 15th Step and stand among the greatest of Razmir's priests. You can Craft your _Razmiri mask_ out of gold or upgrade your existing mask to a gold one in the same time it takes to Craft one made of iron. A gold _Razmiri mask_ grants a +3 item bonus to Deception checks to [[Actions/Lie|Lie]] or [[Actions/Feint|Feint]], is a 14th-level item, and gains the following activation in addition to those possessed by the standard and silver masks.

* * *

**Activate—Call Upon Razmir's Wrath** `pf2:2` (concentrate, manipulate, occult)

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You cry out to Razmir to reveal his fiery wrath, as he did upon the unbelievers at Melcat. You cast [[Spells/Sunburst|Sunburst]] as an 8th-rank occult spell, but for undead targets the spell has the incapacitation trait.

## [[Feats/Living God|Living God]] Feat 20

*   archetype

You have reached heights of power equaling Razmir himself. You can Craft your [[Equipment/Razmiri Mask|Razmiri Mask]] out of porcelain laced with precious metals, or upgrade your existing mask to a porcelain one in the same time it takes to Craft one made of iron. A [[Equipment/Razmiri Mask (Porcelain)|Porcelain Razmiri Mask]] grants a +4 item bonus to Deception checks to [[Actions/Lie|Lie]] or [[Actions/Feint|Feint]], is an 18th-level item, and is an apex item that increases your Charisma modifier by 1 or increases it to +4, whichever would give you a higher score. It also gives you the following activation in addition to those granted by the standard, silver, and gold masks.

* * *

**Activate—Power of the Living God** `pf2:1` (concentrate, manipulate, occult)

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You demand power from the world, using your mask as a locus to force reality to bend to your will. You cast [[Spells/Manifestation|Manifestation]] as a 10th-rank occult spell, but no matter what spell you emulate with it, that spell has the incapacitation trait.
