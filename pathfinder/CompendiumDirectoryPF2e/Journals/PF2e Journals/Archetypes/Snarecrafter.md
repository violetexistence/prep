# Snarecrafter
You're able to take ordinary materials and use them to create deadly snares—special traps that you can rig up quickly when the situation demands. While traps might grant you less brute force to apply in a fair fight than weapons would, you rarely allow your fights to be fair. Instead, when combat takes place at a location of your choosing, you have a major advantage thanks to your well‑placed snares. Once your foes realize that you may have trapped any location on a battlefield, their fear of accidentally setting one off can help you corral them toward the waiting blades of your allies, or even make them too paranoid to move at all, locking them in place. Fearless enemies face their own disadvantage: they run a greater risk of setting off the many traps you've deployed. Even if they somehow avoid them, some cunning snare crafters have the skills to set a trap right under their foes' feet. Others have found they can trigger dangerous snares from a safe distance due to years of practice. Truly, snare crafters make for a dangerous foe and handy ally.

## [[Feats/Snarecrafter Dedication|Snarecrafter Dedication]] Feat 2

*   archetype
*   dedication

**Prerequisites** trained in Crafting, Snare Crafting

* * *

You have studied the art of crafting snares and laying traps, and few have shown more talent in these arts than you. You gain the [[Feats/Snare Crafting|Snare Crafting]] feat. When you set a snare, the DC of any saving throw it requires uses the higher of your class DC or the snare's DC. If a snare normally takes 1 minute to Craft, you can Craft it with 3 Interact actions instead.

Each day during your daily preparations, you can prepare four snares from your formula book for quick deployment (increasing to six snares if you're a master in Crafting and eight if you're legendary). Snares prepared in this way don't cost you any resources to Craft.

When you increase your proficiency rank in Crafting to expert, master, or legendary, add three additional snare formulas to your formula book. The snares must be of your level or lower.

**Special** Rangers can adapt snare crafting techniques to create snares from natural materials. If you are a ranger, you can use Survival instead of Crafting for all prerequisites and functions of feats from this archetype. (This includes using Survival to Craft a snare.)

## [[Feats/Remote Trigger|Remote Trigger]] Feat 6

*   archetype

You've learned how to trigger snares from afar, creating ranged hazards to assail your opponents and allowing you to disarm enemies' snares harmlessly.

You can Strike a snare to trigger it prematurely. If you crafted the snare, you automatically hit. If someone else crafted it, attempt a ranged Strike against the Crafting DC, triggering the snare only if you hit.

## [[Feats/Giant Snare|Giant Snare]] Feat 10

*   archetype

You can create bigger snares for quick deployment, making it more likely for a creature to walk into your snares.

When you prepare snares for quick deployment, you can prepare some of them as giant snares. A giant snare takes up a 10-foot-by-10-foot area but costs two of your quick deployment snares. A giant snare can trigger from a creature entering any portion of its area, and all its effects apply over the full area.

You can prepare incredible numbers of snares each day out of simple ingredients. Double the number of prepared snares granted by [[Feats/Snarecrafter Dedication|Snarecrafter Dedication]].
