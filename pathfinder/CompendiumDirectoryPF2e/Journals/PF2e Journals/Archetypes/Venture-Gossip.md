# Venture-Gossip
Venture-Gossip is not only the name of a beloved agent of the Pathfinder Society who has dedicated herself to bringing all of the lurid, gruesome stories to Absalom's streets—it's also the name of a popular tabloid newsletter that appears across Golarion, primarily wherever there's a Pathfinder Society lodge. There isn't just one venture-gossip: there are hundreds. Hundreds of Pathfinders with loads of stories and rumors that they collect and then forward along to the Ink Worker's United Printing Press, a unionized printing press based out of Absalom. Formally, only one name is associated with Venture-Gossip: Agent Kitsch of the Office of Supplies and Procurement. However, no one truly believes that she's behind any of this, as the older ysoki is known to misplace just about everything, from poison flasks to important cursed artifacts.

## [[Feats/Venture-Gossip Dedication|Venture-Gossip Dedication]] Feat 4

*   archetype
*   dedication

**Prerequisites** member of the Pathfinder Society, Pathfinder Agent Dedication

* * *

Look, the motto of the Pathfinder Society is "explore, report, cooperate" and you're just reporting what you hear! Is all of it accurate or true? Maybe not, but hey, you can tell a great story and you know how to keep your readers hooked and eating out of the palm of your hand. Ambrus Valsin of the Grand Lodge may disapprove of your methods, but hey, he's not your real boss.

Eando isn't either.

We'll go with Zarta.

Wait, no, Sheila. Sheila appreciates a good gossip column. You're now from Magnimar. Always have been.

You have two identities: your day job as a Pathfinder agent, and your real job, one of the many voices that make up the Venture-Gossip tabloid. If someone attempts to figure out if you're a venture-gossip, they must use a [[Actions/Seek|Seek]] action to attempt a Perception check against one of your influence skills of your choice: Deception, Diplomacy, or Intimidation. Your DC is 20 + your proficiency modifier.

If you are discovered to be part of Venture-Gossip, you can spend 1 week of downtime convincing others that you've never even read that tabloid, much less contributed to it!

You gain the following action, allowing you to collect more information for your column.

### [[Actions/Tell Me More|Tell Me More]] 2 (fortune)

**Target** one creature that shares a language you speak

**Requirements** You're not in combat

* * *

**Effect** Just batting your eyes and giving someone a familiar nudge can get them talking, ready to spill the beans about everything and everyone around them. You roll twice on all rolls to influence the target and use the better result.

## [[Feats/Verbose Distraction|Verbose Distraction]] Feat 6

*   archetype
*   auditory

**Trigger** You are the target of a physical melee attack.

* * *

You talk so much it can be distracting to your enemies and you're often quick to remind your enemies that you're just a little guy! You don't need to be targeted! You don't need to be the focus of their frustrations! Have they tried writing to their mom or talking to a local priest of Desna? Ow!

You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your AC against the triggering attack.

## [[Feats/Hey! Over Here!|Hey! Over Here!]] Feat 6

*   archetype
*   auditory

**Trigger** An ally within 30 feet rolls a saving throw against an auditory effect.

* * *

Hey! Don't listen to that! That's bad sounds! Listen to me! Would you like to hear about how the high priest of the Abadaran church in Absalom's Petals District is having an affair with an Urgathoan cleric? Yeah, I'm thinking about calling the article "Boney Money!"

Your targeted ally treats the result of their saving throw as one degree of success better. Once an ally has been targeted by this effect, they're immune for 24 hours.

## [[Feats/A Little Bird Told Me...|A Little Bird Told Me...]] Feat 8

*   archetype
*   concentrate
*   manipulate
*   polymorph

You transform into a small bird, such as a finch or a sparrow, allowing you to eavesdrop on others and gain information you wouldn't otherwise be able to acquire. You become Tiny, gain the animal trait, and you can't make Strikes. You can Dismiss the effect to return to your normal shape, and you resume your normal shape automatically if you're reduced to 0 Hit Points.

You gain the following statistics and abilities:

AC = 20 + your level. Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction.

Fly speed 25 feet.

Weakness 5 to physical damage.

Low-light vision and imprecise scent 30 feet.

Acrobatics and Stealth modifiers of +10, unless your own is higher; Athletics modifier –4.

## [[Feats/Define “Report”|Define “Report”]] Feat 10

*   archetype
*   fortune

Look, getting caught in a lie is a normal part of venture-gossip life. Sometimes you have to give a sheepish smile and apologize for what you've done. When you fail a Deception check, reroll with your Diplomacy modifier. On a success, there are no hard feelings and the other person's attitude condition doesn't worsen. On a critical success, you can attempt the Deception again with no consequences.

## [[Feats/Catch and Kill|Catch and Kill]] Feat 12

*   archetype

**Trigger** A creature within your reach uses a move action, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.

* * *

When you've decided to quash a story, no one can escape from you with any incriminating information. Make a melee Strike against the triggering creature. On a hit, the triggering creature is Grabbed, and on a critical hit, they're [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]]. This Strike doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike.

## [[Feats/Muckraking|Muckraking]] Feat 12

*   archetype
*   auditory
*   concentrate
*   emotion
*   mental

It seems like your knowledge has come in handy after all and you have your enemy at your feet. Pulling out your fan mail, you read your fans' scathing remarks about your enemy to their face, letting them feel just how much everyone hates them and everything that they've done. They hate the way that they walk, they hate the way that they talk.

Your enemy takes 10d10 mental damage, with a basic `Will check` save. On a critical failure, they're [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the beginning of your next turn and lose all reactions, except to cry, loudly.
