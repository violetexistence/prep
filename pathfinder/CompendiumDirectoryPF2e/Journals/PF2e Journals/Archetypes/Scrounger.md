# Scrounger
*   Uncommon

You have spent countless hours disassembling and rebuilding complex items to learn how they work, giving you the skill to create just about anything from the most unlikely materials. While your improvised items don't last long, they tend to be just what you need in a pinch, and your enemies find that while they might be able to disarm you, the real challenge is keeping you that way. Locked rooms, diabolical traps, and desperate situations are each their own sort of puzzle to you, and the mundane objects around you are the pieces you use to improvise your own solutions. Few are more resourceful. Given time and a handful of gears, bits, and widgets, you can create the perfect tool for just about any situation. Your ingenuity is extremely valuable while adventuring. Adventurers never truly know what's in store for them and often find themselves ill-prepared for the task at hand. Bringing along a scrounger such as you is like bringing any tool that could possibly be needed, provided your constant attempts to break down and reassemble everything aren't a bother. You never know what you may need in the future.

## [[Feats/Scrounger Dedication|Scrounger Dedication]] Feat 2

*   Uncommon
*   archetype
*   dedication

**Prerequisites** trained in Crafting

* * *

While others need specialized tools and a dedicated space, you have found a way to build just about anything, anywhere. You can Craft items even without appropriate tools or a workshop. Additionally, you don't need a physical formula book to remember all of your formulas; you pay the same cost as normal to learn them, but you memorize them all. You gain the [[Actions/Cobble Together|Cobble Together]] activity.

An item you Cobble Together is a shoddy item, but when creating it you can choose one creature to build it specifically for. That creature doesn't take the normal penalty for using this shoddy item. Your temporary item lasts for 1d4 hours before falling apart into its raw components; the GM rolls the number of hours secretly.

## [[Feats/Reverse Engineering|Reverse Engineering]] Feat 4

*   archetype
*   skill

Your nigh-constant tinkering and fiddling with objects means you are able to reverse engineer items into formulas more effectively than most.

You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Crafting checks to reverse engineer a formula from an item, and you can attempt a Crafting check to reverse engineer an item after spending 1 day of work setting up instead of 2. Additionally, if you get a critical success on your Crafting check, you can opt to not only create the formula but also reassemble the original item at the same time, leaving you with the formula and the item instead of the formula and raw materials equal to half the item's value.

You can [[Actions/Craft|Craft]] a temporary wondrous item using the magic scrounged from all around. Once per day, you can [[Actions/Cobble Together|Cobble Together]] a temporary magic item.
