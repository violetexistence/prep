# Familiar Master
From the wise owl perched on the wizard's shoulder to the crafty gremlin that serves the witch for their own reasons, the ghastly homunculus in the alchemist's lab to the clever monkey that picks the lock of the thief's cell, familiars have always served. Yours serves better than most. This is often due to an unusually strong connection or rigorous intentional training. Regardless of the method, the extraordinary qualities of your familiar are undeniable.

You and your familiar are a team in and of yourselves. In a tough situation, you know you have each other's back, and you are nigh inseparable. Some familiar masters, however, choose to keep familiars for only a short period. They will keep their ally for a time, then release them and forge a new bond. They form strong connections quickly and attract new familiars everywhere they go. This behavior is less common but is often done out of a high level of respect for the independence of both the adventurer and the familiar, or a strong connection to the ebb and flow of life and the cycle of change that touches all things. You are among these masters and can decide which practice best suits you.

**Additional Feats:** **4th** [[Feats/Enhanced Familiar|Enhanced Familiar]]

## [[Feats/Familiar Master Dedication|Familiar Master Dedication]] Feat 2

*   archetype
*   dedication

**Prerequisites**

* * *

You have forged a mystical bond with a creature. This might have involved complex rituals and invocations, such as meditating under the moon until something crept out of the forest. Or maybe you just did each other a good turn, such as rescuing the beast from a trap or a foe, and then being rescued in turn.

Whatever the details, you are now comrades until the end. You gain a familiar. If you already have a familiar, you gain the [[Feats/Enhanced Familiar|Enhanced Familiar]] feat.

Under your tutelage, your familiar has grown attuned to the hidden currents of the world and can serve as a conduit for your magic. If the next action you use is to [[Actions/Cast a Spell|Cast a Spell]] that has a range, the spell uses the familiar as its origin point.

## [[Feats/Mutable Familiar|Mutable Familiar]] Feat 8

*   archetype

Your familiar's supernatural spirit has outgrown its corporeal body. You can conduct a special 10-minute activity to reselect certain familiar abilities, switching one or more of the following abilities for other abilities on this list: amphibious, burrower, climber, darkvision, fast movement, manual dexterity, resistance, and scent.

You can reselect only familiar abilities you would normally be able to reselect each day, not required familiar abilities for your familiar. You can't remove an ability that is required for another ability your familiar has (for instance, you can't remove manual dexterity if the familiar has lab assistant).
