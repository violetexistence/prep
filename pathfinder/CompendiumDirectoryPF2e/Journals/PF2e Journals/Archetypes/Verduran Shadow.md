# Verduran Shadow
*   Uncommon

Primal energy exists for far more than being gathered, shaped, and directed by druids; like air currents, it flows naturally through an environment. With the proper training, an explorer can perceive these currents, sensing cues carried on them like airborne scents. With further work, they can drift with these energies like a leaf on a river, or even hide themselves in the primal eddies to evade their foes' senses. Too much exposure can erode the practitioner's higher thoughts, leaving behind a predatory cunning that augments their combat abilities at the risk of wearing away their sense of self.

These techniques have developed independently, spread, and then faded to obscurity countless times, with the Verduran Forest boasting the largest population of practitioners, who are known as Verduran shadows. Developed by the hunter Treyinca centuries ago, Verduran shadow techniques are widespread among the region's guardians but rarely taught to outsiders. Treyinca's fate is unknown, and some speculate she transformed into a primal spirit that mentors woodland warriors to this day.

## [[Feats/Verduran Shadow Dedication|Verduran Shadow Dedication]] Feat 2

*   Uncommon
*   archetype
*   dedication

**Prerequisites** trained in Stealth, trained in Survival

* * *

Your awareness of primal energies allows you to explore forests with preternatural ease. You become an expert in Survival. You can substitute your proficiency in Survival for your proficiency in Stealth when meeting feat prerequisites and gaining additional benefits from feats for being an expert, master, or legendary in Stealth; however, unless you also fulfill the Stealth prerequisite, you can only use those feats in forest terrain. While in forests, you can use your Survival modifier in place of your Stealth modifier when you [[Actions/Avoid Notice|Avoid Notice]], [[Actions/Hide|Hide]], [[Actions/Sneak|Sneak]], or would use Stealth to roll initiative.

## [[Feats/Canopy Predator|Canopy Predator]] Feat 4

*   Uncommon

You are as at home in the treetops as you are beneath their branches. You gain a climb Speed of 15 feet when moving through trees, vines, and other foliage. Whenever you succeed at an Athletics check to Climb a tree or an Acrobatics check to [[Actions/Balance|Balance]] on a branch, you get a critical success instead. You aren't [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] while Climbing or Balancing on a tree.

## [[Feats/Underbrush Trailblazer|Underbrush Trailblazer]] Feat 4

*   Uncommon
*   archetype

You gain the [[Feats/Terrain Stalker|Terrain Stalker]] feat, selecting the underbrush terrain; if you already have Terrain Stalker for underbrush, you can select a different type of difficult terrain. If you [[Actions/Avoid Notice|Avoid Notice]] while exploring, and if any allies use [[Actions/Follow the Expert|Follow the Expert]] to follow you as you do so, you can extend your Terrain Stalker feat's benefits to one ally so long as they remain within 10 feet of you. If you have master proficiency in Stealth, you can extend the effect to two allies. If you have legendary proficiency in Stealth, you can extend it to four allies.

## [[Feats/Verduran Ambush|Verduran Ambush]] Feat 6

*   Uncommon
*   archetype

You prepare to ambush a foe. You Ready an activity that takes 2 actions, though that activity must either be Death from Above or an activity with the requirement that you be [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] or [[Conditions/Undetected|Undetected]] by all your opponents (such as [[Feats/Scout's Pounce|Scout's Pounce]]). After using the reaction, you cannot use this feat again for 10 minutes.

## [[Feats/Death from Above|Death from Above]] Feat 8

*   Uncommon
*   archetype

**Requirements** You are standing, climbing, or balancing on a surface at least 10 feet above your target.

* * *

You leap down on your target, using their body to cushion your fall and your momentum to empower your attack. Attempt an Athletics check to [[Actions/Leap|Leap]] to a space adjacent to the target. If you land adjacent to the target, compare the `Athletics check` check result against your target's Reflex DC.

When you leap onto a creature in this way, you do not also deal damage for falling on a creature. Regardless of your result, the target is temporarily immune to your Death from Above for 1 minute.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target falls and lands [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]], reducing the falling damage you take by an amount equal to twice your level. You then can make a melee Strike against the target. The Strike gains the deadly d8 weapon property and deals an additional 1d6 bludgeoning damage. This additional damage increases to 2d6 if you are a master in Athletics, and to 3d6 if you are legendary in Athletics.

**Success** The target is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the beginning of your next turn, reducing the falling damage you take by an amount equal to your level. You can then make a melee Strike against the target, adding the deadly d8 weapon property to the attack.

**Failure** You can make a Strike against the target.

**Critical Failure** You fall prone, whether you take falling damage or not.

## [[Feats/Sense the Strike|Sense the Strike]] Feat 10

*   Uncommon
*   archetype

**Trigger** A creature targets you with an attack and you can see the attacker.

* * *

You sense how an incoming attack moves through ambient primal energy, predicting how best to dodge. The triggering attack targets your Survival DC instead of your AC. Though this allows you to avoid taking penalties to your AC, it doesn't remove any conditions or other effects causing such penalties. For example, an enemy with sneak attack would still deal extra damage to you for being [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]], even though you wouldn't take the â€“2 circumstance penalty when defending against the attack.
