# Mauler
You shove your way through legions of foes, knock enemies on all sides to the ground, and deal massive blows to anyone or anything that comes near. You know that when it comes to taking down an enemy, it never hurts to have a bigger weapon.

**Additional Feats:** **4th** [[Feats/Slam Down|Slam Down]], [[Feats/Vicious Swing|Vicious Swing]]; **12th** [[Feats/Crashing Slam|Crashing Slam]]; **14th** [[Feats/Brutal Finish|Brutal Finish]], [[Feats/Unbalancing Sweep|Unbalancing Sweep]]

## [[Feats/Mauler Dedication|Mauler Dedication]] Feat 2

*   archetype
*   dedication

**Prerequisites** Strength +2

* * *

You specialize in melee weapons that require two hands. You have familiarity with all melee weapons that require two hands to wield or have the two-hand trait. For the purposes of proficiency, you treat any of these that are martial weapons as simple weapons and any that are advanced weapons as martial weapons.

If you are at least an expert in such a weapon, you gain access to the critical specialization effect with that weapon.

## [[Feats/Clear the Way|Clear the Way]] Feat 6

*   archetype

**Requirements** You're wielding a melee weapon in two hands.

* * *

You put your body behind your massive weapon and swing, shoving enemies to clear a wide path. You attempt to [[Actions/Shove|Shove]] up to five creatures adjacent to you, rolling a separate Athletics check for each target and ignoring the requirement that you have a hand free. Then Stride up to half your Speed. This movement doesn't trigger reactions from any of the creatures you successfully Shoved. Each attack counts toward your multiple attack penalty, but don't increase your penalty until you have made all your attacks.

## [[Feats/Hammer Quake|Hammer Quake]] Feat 14

*   archetype
*   flourish

**Requirements** You're wielding a non-finesse melee weapon in two hands.

* * *

You smash the ground with your weapon, knocking nearby creatures to the ground. Choose a square within your reach, including your own space. If there's an enemy in the chosen square, you can Strike that enemy with your two-handed weapon. Regardless of whether you attempted a Strike, you then attempt to [[Actions/Trip|Trip]] every enemy in the chosen square plus each square adjacent to that square, ignoring Trip's requirement that you have a hand free.

Hammer Quake counts as three attacks toward your multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after you've made the Strike, if any, and all the Trip attempts.
