# Ghost Eater
*   Uncommon

The warriors of Minata frequently contend with lost spirits of the Taumatan people that haunt their shattered lands to this day. These Minatan warriors, known as ghost eaters around Bonmu, travel the countless islands of Minata and offer their skills to exorcists and priests. When working in such a partnership, ghost eater's main task is to destroy a spirit in order to give their holy comrade time to learn about the individual soul and finally put it to rest.

Characters can gain access to this archetype from Ingdani after they retrieve the [[Equipment/Phoenix Necklace|Phoenix Necklace]] from the temple of Irori.

## [[Feats/Reach Beyond|Reach Beyond]] Feat 4

*   archetype

You've learned to move your spiritual energy past yourself to attack spirits where others can't. You can make melee Strikes against incorporeal creatures that are inside solid objects as long as the object is within your reach. An incorporeal creature inside of a solid object is hidden, requiring you to succeed at a `DC 11 Flat check` when you target it. You can spend an action, which has the concentrate trait, to focus on a creature inside of a solid object. If you do, the next melee Strike you make this turn requires you to succeed at only a `DC 6 Flat check` to affect the creature.

You call forth vitality energy from within to help you destroy undead. Your weapon and unarmed Strikes gain the effects of a _disrupting_ property rune until the start of your next turn.

If you're 14th level or higher, your Strikes instead gain the effects of a _greater disrupting property rune_. The DC for the rune's effect is equal to your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.
