# Seneschal (Class Archetype)
*   Rare

Whether dead or simply missing, your patron has gone silent, and you can no longer hear its whisper. While other witches might find this silence disquieting and lose hope without direction, you embrace this new challenge. Without a governor, you can now realize the true potential of your magic by tapping into the connection you once shared with your absent patron. You are no longer bound by the your patron's desires; you are free to forge your own path.

**Additional Feats: 10th** [[Feats/Martyr|Martyr]]; **16th** [[Feats/Premonition of Clarity|Premonition of Clarity]]; **18th** [[Feats/Inviolable|Inviolable]]

## [[Class Features/Seneschal|Seneschal]]1st

*   witch

Your witch patron has gone mysteriously silent. You still have access to your abilities, and your familiar is still funneling your patron's power to you. As you learn how to tap into that power, you influence your familiar to mold the power by itself, continuing to learn new spells and provide you with other witch class features.

Without your patron watching over your power, you gain more control but also miss important lessons. You must select [[Feats/Seneschal Witch Dedication|Seneschal Witch Dedication]] as your 2nd-level class feat.

**Prerequisites:** You must be a witch who has lost contact with your patron.

**Adjustments:** Instead of your patron's lesson, you gain the [[Spells/Manifest Will|Manifest Will]] hex cantrip and your familiar learns one common 1st-rank spell of your choice from your spell list.

*   dedication

**Prerequisites** seneschal witch

* * *

As you work to understand the connection with your missing patron, it's increasingly easy to form bonds with those around you. Raw magical energy spills easily through the connection but, without a patron's control, it sometimes resists your demands for it to form proper spells.

You gain the Witch's Charge feat, but can't choose your familiar or another creature with the minion trait as a charge. When you cast or Sustain manifest will, as long as your charge is within 30 feet, you can choose to center the spell's emanation on your charge instead of yourself.

## [[Feats/Patron's Glamour|Patron's Glamour]] Feat 4

*   archetype
*   auditory
*   illusion

Gathering up threads of your old connection, you can temporarily disguise yourself as your missing patron. You gain [[Spells/Illusory Disguise|Illusory Disguise]] as an innate spell of your patron's tradition, automatically heightened to the rank of your witch cantrips, but you can use it only to disguise yourself as the humanoid representation of your patron. Detection spells of lower rank than this _illusory disguise_ give your patron's information rather than your own.

## [[Feats/Seneschal Spell|Seneschal Spell]] Feat 4

*   archetype
*   spellshape

**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

You can channel even complex spells through your connection to your charge. If your next action is to Cast a Spell and your charge is within 30 feet, you can have the spell originate from your charge instead. That creature can use their reaction to roughly complete the spell's incantation, which gives the spell the subtle trait for you (but not for them) as the manifestation appears solely around your charge.

## [[Feats/Multifaceted Will|Multifaceted Will]] Feat 6

*   archetype

Without the firm hand of a patron, your power begins to reflect deeper complexities, sometimes latching onto entirely unexpected sources of magical potency. When you cast or Sustain [[Spells/Manifest Will|Manifest Will]], you can choose any tradition's manifestation. While the spell is active, you and allies in its area gain a +1 status bonus to saves against spells with that tradition trait.

## [[Feats/Spiritual Secret|Spiritual Secret]] Feat 6

*   archetype
*   spellshape

**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

You gain deeper insights into your patron's abandoned power, allowing you to draw on that power more directly. If your next action is to cast a witch cantrip or witch spell that deals damage, it deals spirit damage instead of its normal type. It also loses any traits related to its damage, such as the fire or mental trait, and gains the sanctified and spirit traits instead.

## [[Feats/Watcher on the Wall|Watcher on the Wall]] Feat 8

*   archetype

You claim a patron's symbol that you can etch onto any surface. Etch a symbol onto an adjacent surface; you can see and hear what you could from the symbol's location as long as you are on the same plane. This effect lasts until you place another symbol or the surface is destroyed.

## [[Feats/Patron's Whisper|Patron's Whisper]] Feat 10

*   archetype
*   auditory

You gain the ability to speak to your charge over great distances. You gain [[Spells/Message|Message]] as an innate cantrip of your former patron's tradition. You can send a _message_ to a creature regardless of range if they have ever been your charge. If you [[Actions/Lie|Lie]] as part of the message, the target receives a –2 circumstance penalty to their Perception DC and to [[Actions/Sense Motive|Sense Motive]] checks to reveal the lie.

## [[Feats/Unstable Patronage|Unstable Patronage]] Feat 14

*   archetype
*   spellshape

You can act as a magical patron for your charges. When you finish your daily preparations, choose a spell your familiar knows and one of your charges. Once before your next daily preparations, that creature can Cast the Spell as an innate spell; this spell can be of no higher a rank than the highest rank of spells you can cast –2.

## [[Feats/Patron Reborn|Patron Reborn]] Feat 20

*   archetype

You have fully realized the ability to serve as a patron.

Your newfound abilities enhance your senses, rolling back the veil of a realm hidden to most mortals where great beings vie for unimaginable influence over vast worlds. You gain darkvision, constant [[Spells/Truesight|Truesight]], and the ability to see into all other transitive planes that overlap the one you are in.

You can be a patron for other witches. Choose a single type of patron you represent, such as [[Class Features/The Resentment|The Resentment]] or [[Class Features/Starless Shadow|Starless Shadow]]. An allied witch you can observe who has that patron counts as and gains the benefits of your [[Feats/Witch's Charge|Witch's Charge]] feat, even if you did not select them as your charge during your daily preparations.

You learn the [[Spells/Wish|Wish]] ritual and can impart that knowledge to your charges. Once per month, when one of your charges performs the _wish_ ritual, you can roll the skill check in their place.

# Seneschal Witch Focus Spells

### [[Spells/Manifest Will|Manifest Will]] Focus 1

You unleash energy from the broken connection to your patron. You are [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] from creatures beyond the edge of the emanation but can't use that concealment to [[Actions/Hide|Hide]]. Any creature that begins its turn in the emanation is affected based on your patron's tradition.

[[Spell Effects/Aura_ Manifest Will|Aura: Manifest Will]]

*   **Arcane** Raw energy and magical formulae circulate around you. A creature that begins its turn in the emanation gains weakness 1 to spell damage for 1 round.
*   **Divine** Divine power crashes in a cycle of life and death. A living or undead creature that begins its turn in the emanation gains 2 temporary Hit Points for 1 round. This effect has the spirit trait.
*   **Occult** Esoteric symbology etches the air. An allied creature that begins its turn in the emanation has [[Other Effects/Effect_ Cover|Lesser Cover]] while inside the emanation, and for 1 round after it leaves.
*   **Primal** Plants and fungus symbolic of your patron constantly grow and wither in the emanation. A creature that begins its turn in the emanation has a –10-foot status penalty to all its Speeds for 1 round or until it [[Actions/Escape|Escapes]]. This effect has the fungus, plant, and wood traits.

[[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Manifest Will|Spell Effect: Manifest Will]]

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** An arcane manifestation increases its weakness by 1 and a divine manifestation increases its temporary Hit Points by 2.
