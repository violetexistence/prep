# Mortal Herald
*   Rare

When a follower earns the respect and trust of their god, the god sometimes grants that worshipper a great boon in the form of enhanced divine power. This chosen follower becomes a mortal herald, a living instrument for their god. Like a champion or cleric of a deity, a mortal herald has great divine power coursing through them, allowing the individual to enact the god's will within the Universe. Unlike a champion or cleric however, the god recognizes that their chosen mortal herald has skills and abilities that may be unique to them. Not every mortal herald is clad in impenetrable armor or capable of casting divine magic. Instead, the god grants gifts to their mortal herald that best match the individual's strengths. Regardless of who the person was before becoming a mortal herald, they are now a powerful divine being in their own right. Due to the specific needs of a deity and the dedicated nature of a mortal herald, a follower of a covenant or pantheon can't become a mortal herald.

In some cases, the god grants greater potential to their mortal heralds in the form of mythic power. A mythic character can select the mortal herald archetype as their mythic destiny. You must be a mythic character to select feats from this archetype that have the mythic trait. More information about mythic destinies can be found in Pathfinder War of Immortals.

## [[Feats/Mortal Herald Dedication|Mortal Herald Dedication]] Feat 12

*   Rare
*   dedication
*   archetype

**Prerequisites** worshipper of a specific deity, master in Religion or your deity's divine skill

* * *

You become a mortal herald of your deity, gaining power in return for your service. Others intuitively sense your connection with your deity, which subtly influences the way they act around you. You become bound by your deity's anathema. Depending on your deity, their sanctification can make you holy or unholy. This gives you the holy or unholy trait, which commits you to one side of a struggle over the souls of the planes and can be referenced in other abilities. If you "can be" holy or unholy according to your deity, you make that choice, and if you "must be" holy or unholy you gain the trait automatically. If you gain the opposing trait in some way, you lose the previous trait until you complete an [[Spells/Atone|Atone]] ritual.

In addition, once per day, you can cast [[Spells/Heal|Heal]] as a 6th-rank innate divine spell. You can only target yourself with the spell, but you gain the benefits of the 2-action version when you spend 1 action to cast it. In addition, if you would be reduced to 0 Hit Points but not immediately killed, you can cast the spell as a free action before you become [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]]. This spell is automatically heightened to a rank equal to half your level.

* * *

**Special** If you have void healing, you instead cast [[Spells/Harm|Harm]].

## [[Feats/Domain Embodiment|Domain Embodiment]] Feat 14

*   archetype

Your deity contains multitudes, and you can express any aspect of them you desire. During your daily preparations, you can gain two initial or advanced domain spells from any of your deity's domains or alternate domains. You can cast these as innate spells until your next daily preparations.

Domain spells are a type of focus spell. Casting any of your focus spells costs you 1 Focus Point. The maximum number of Focus Points in your pool is equal to the number of focus spells you know or 3, whichever is lower. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to pray to your deity or do service toward their causes. Your domain spells are divine spells. If you were not already, you become trained in spell attacks and spell DCs. Your spellcasting attribute for domain spells is Wisdom.
