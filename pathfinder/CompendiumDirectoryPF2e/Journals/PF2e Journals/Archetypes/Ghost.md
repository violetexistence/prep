# Ghost
*   Rare

Your ties to the living world cling to you in death, your unfinished business reducing you to a spirit. Your soul carries on, but your body is gone. Your mind, too, may have changed: though death can impact thoughts and desires in all sorts of ways, most ghosts experience stronger, more volatile emotions and are frequently overcome by their past ties. A need to reconcile the past overwhelms other needs. Motivations can change over time but are always strong. Pragmatism, compassion, and foresight fall before a ghost's fundamental desires.

## [[Feats/Ghost Dedication|Ghost Dedication]] Feat 2

*   Rare
*   archetype
*   dedication

**Prerequisites** You died and returned as a ghost.

* * *

You have risen as a shell of your former self, a spirit of mist and anguish. You gain the ghost, spirit, and undead traits, and the [[Ancestry Features/Basic Undead Benefits|Basic Undead Benefits]]. Your undead craving is to settle your unfinished business. You also gain the incorporeal trait, except you can't pass through solid objects unless you select the Pass Through feat. Being a ghost has the following major effects.

**Floating** You can float but are still tethered to the ground. Replace your land Speed with an equal fly Speed. You can't rise more than a few inches above the ground when you Fly. This means you can move above many types of difficult or hazardous terrain without moving slowly or being damaged, even though you can't fly without limit. You can [[Actions/Leap|Leap]], [[Actions/High Jump|High Jump]], [[Actions/Long Jump|Long Jump]], and take similar actions, and use your fly Speed for any calculations that would normally require your land Speed.

**Items** You can transmute physical items to make them part of your incorporeal form. This requires spending 10 minutes with the items within reach, during which you transform the items into part of your form; you can return items you already have incorporated to a corporeal state at the same time. The items retain all their runes and other abilities, need to be invested normally if they have the invested trait, and need to be worn, held, or stowed appropriately. Once you've incorporated the items, you and other incorporeal creatures can use them normally-you can Interact with them, Release them, and so on. Your incorporated weapons gain the benefits of the ghost touch property rune, allowing you to use them normally against both corporeal and incorporeal creatures. Incorporated items become corporeal again only if you transmute them back or are destroyed, in which case, they drop to the ground under you.

**Attacks** Your unarmed attacks become magical and deal void damage instead of their normal type.

**Strength** Unlike most incorporeal creatures, your Strength modifier is not -5; you keep the same Strength score you had before you became a ghost, though you can only attempt Strength-based skill checks-typically Athletics checks-against other incorporeal creatures, as normal for an incorporeal creature. Against incorporeal creatures, use your Strength normally to determine the results of Athletics checks, Strikes with melee weapons, and any other checks or damage rolls dependent on Strength.

**Ties that Bind** When you become a ghost, work with your GM to choose a bound site and unfinished business, both of which matter for your character's story, as well as some ghost archetype feats. Your bound site tethers you to the physical world and is typically either a location important to you in life or the place where you died. Unfinished business keeps you from passing to the afterlife. If someone resolves your unfinished business, you decide whether to accept the change and pass on, or to fight it. If you pass on, you get a few minutes to say your goodbyes, and then move into the River of Souls and the afterlife. Your character ceases to be. If you fight the change, you remain, though you and the GM might determine a new unfinished business. If you are physically destroyed, you cease your existence as a ghost but still might not be able to pass on to the afterlife if your unfinished business is incomplete. In this liminal state, you might come across strange energies and become another sort of creature, or anchor to a summoner and become an eidolon.

## [[Feats/Frightful Moan|Frightful Moan]] Feat 4

*   archetype
*   auditory
*   divine
*   emotion
*   fear
*   mental

**Frequency** once per 10 minutes

* * *

You lament your fate, forcing each living creature in a 30-foot emanation to attempt a `Will check` save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.

**Success** The creature is unaffected and temporarily immune to Frightful Moans for 1 minute.

**Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]].

**Critical Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]].

## [[Feats/Ghostly Resistance|Ghostly Resistance]] Feat 4

*   archetype

Your ghostly form becomes innately weaker but also gains resistance to many forms of damage. Your maximum HP is reduced by your level. You gain resistance 1 to all damage except for force, vitality, and any damage done by a weapon with the ghost touch rune (or any other source that acts like a ghost touch rune). This resistance increases to 2 if the source is non-magical.

At 10th level, the resistance increases to 2, or 4 if the source is non-magical. At 16th level, the resistance increases to 3, or 5 if the source is non-magical.

## [[Feats/Headless Haunt|Headless Haunt]] Feat 4

*   Rare
*   archetype

**Access** You were executed with a [[Equipment/Final Blade|Final Blade]].

* * *

You were condemned to death and executed with one of Galt's infamous _final blades_, where your soul was trapped for years or even decades. You might have been released alongside a host of other spirits when your prison was destroyed after the Night of the Gray Death, or powerful magic or other unique circumstances might have facilitated your escape. Whatever the method, you have unfinished business preventing you from passing on to the afterlife. You gain the [[Actions/Remove Head|Remove Head]] action.

## [[Feats/Fling Head|Fling Head]] Feat 6

*   archetype
*   auditory
*   manipulate

You Interact to remove your head, if it isn't already detached, and fling it at an enemy within 30 feet, where it emits a bone-chilling wail before dematerializing and returning to your body. Your target must attempt a `Will check` save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. You can affect one additional creature within 20 feet of your original target for each additional action you spend.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]].

**Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] and can't reduce their frightened value below 1 while they remain within 30 feet of you.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 3]].

## [[Feats/Ghostly Grasp|Ghostly Grasp]] Feat 6

*   archetype

Your control over your ghostly form grows. You gain the [[Ancestry Features/Advanced Undead Benefits|Advanced Undead Benefits]] and can interact with physical objects, with limits. You can attempt Strength-based skill checks against physical creatures and objects. You can Interact with physical objects, but the action has no effect unless you succeed at a `DC 20 Athletics check` or `DC 20 Thievery check` check.

## [[Feats/Ghost Flight|Ghost Flight]] Feat 8

*   archetype

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

You can suppress your tether to the ground, overcoming your resistance to fly free. For 10 minutes, your fly Speed doesn't restrict you to only a few inches off the ground, allowing you to travel to any height you choose.

_Source: Pathfinder Book of the Dead_

## [[Feats/Haunting Memories|Haunting Memories]] Feat 8

*   archetype

Your soul bears metaphysical impressions of the innumerable other spirits imprisoned with you in the [[Equipment/Final Blade|Final Blade]] from which you escaped, allowing you to draw upon their memories. When you make your daily preparations, you can either gain the expert proficiency rank in one skill in which you're untrained or raise your proficiency rank to master in one skill in which you're trained or better. You also gain one skill feat with a minimum requirement of your new rank in the chosen skill. For the purpose of meeting level prerequisites for this feat, your level is equal to half your level.

This proficiency and feat last until you make your daily preparations again. Since the proficiency is temporary, you can't use it as a prerequisite for any permanent character option.

## [[Feats/Klingegeist|Klingegeist]] Feat 10

*   archetype
*   concentrate
*   possession

Your imprisonment inside a [[Equipment/Final Blade|Final Blade]] used to perform countless executions has instilled in you an aptitude for entering and possessing similar sharp implements of murder. You project your mind and incorporeal body into an unattended weapon of 2 Bulk or less that deals slashing damage.

While possessing a blade, you have a space of 5 feet, but you don't block or impede enemies attempting to move through your space, nor do you benefit from or provide flanking. You're trained in the use of the weapon, unless your proficiency was already better, and you can make Strike actions with the weapon as if you were wielding it.

You gain a Fly speed of 30 feet and can only take Strike and Fly actions, which don't trigger reactions. You have an AC of 18 + your level and the Hardness and Hit Points of the weapon you're possessing, which for most one-handed slashing weapons is Hardness 5 and HP 20. You can't be Disarmed, nor can your true body be directly injured except by spirit damage, which bypasses both the weapon's Hardness and Hit Points to damage you directly.

If you're reduced to 0 Hit Points or the weapon you're inhabiting is broken or destroyed, you're immediately ejected from it and [[Conditions/Paralyzed|Paralyzed]] for 1 round. Otherwise, the effect lasts for 10 minutes or until you Dismiss it.

## [[Feats/Pass Through|Pass Through]] Feat 10

*   archetype

**Frequency** once per 10 minutes

* * *

Filtering your form through the substance of an object, you can pass through walls, doors, and more. You Fly up to your Speed. During this movement, you can try to move through one object. Attempt an Acrobatics check as you try to enter its space. The DC is typically 30 to move through a wall of up to 5 feet, 15 for an ordinary door, and 10 for thinner structures like windows; the GM might set the DC higher for especially dense materials like adamantine or lead, or for barriers that are magically reinforced. You can't Pass Through an obstacle made of magical force, such as a [[Spells/Wall of Force|Wall of Force]].

Move through wall

Move through door

Move through window

**Success** You move through the object, treating the square within it as difficult terrain. If you end your turn inside an object, you can move out of it only if you Pass Through again or use some other means of moving through a solid object. As normal for being incorporeal, starting your turn inside an object makes you [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] for that turn.

**Failure** Your movement ends, and you trigger reactions as if you moved out of the square you started in.

## [[Feats/Ghostly Condemnation|Ghostly Condemnation]] Feat 12

*   archetype
*   divine
*   emotion
*   fear
*   mental

You shriek a death sentence upon a single target within 120 feet, forcing it to experience the final moments of your mortal life as you were dragged through a howling mob and forced to kneel before the final blade that took your life and head. The target is subject to the effects of a 5th-rank [[Spells/Vision of Death|Vision of Death]] with a DC equal to your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. If you slay a significant foe with this ability, its physical body is gruesomely decapitated, forcing its allies within 15 feet to attempt a Will save against the same DC or be [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]] ([[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] on a critical failure).

## [[Feats/Rejuvenation|Rejuvenation]] Feat 12

*   Rare
*   archetype

The call of your unfinished business recreates you after destruction. When you're destroyed, you reform after 2d4 days within your bound site, fully healed. If your unfinished business is resolved while you're waiting, you pass on immediately unless you and the GM determine you have new unfinished business.

## [[Feats/Unlimited Ghost Flight|Unlimited Ghost Flight]] Feat 14

*   archetype

You put your connection to the material world farther behind you. Your fly Speed no longer restricts the height you can fly. When you use [[Feats/Ghost Flight|Ghost Flight]], instead of its normal effect, you gain a +10-foot status bonus to your fly Speed for 10 minutes.
