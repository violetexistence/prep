# Necrologist
*   Rare

Though some may think it morbid, you spend your time compiling and studying lists of the dead, from town or church records that date back hundreds of years to more recent records of battlefield casualties. You have become so invested in the lives and stories of these unfortunates that you can tap into your own animating force to bring them all temporarily back from the dead at once. This usually entails enacting esoteric arcana, occult rites, or divine pacts with gods of the undead. Necrologists can be valuable assets in any battle, as their hordes are essentially expendable and in endless supply.

## [[Feats/Necrologist Dedication|Necrologist Dedication]] Feat 6

*   Rare
*   archetype
*   dedication

**Prerequisites** ability to cast spells from spell slots, ability to cast summon undead

* * *

Your studies of the lists of the dead allow you to call forth a horde of undead with a brief incantation. You can summon your horde with the [[Actions/Raise the Horde|Raise the Horde]] activity, and you can use the [[Actions/Mobbing Assault|Mobbing Assault]] action while your horde is raised to command it to attack. The eerie connection you have with your horde precludes you from also having an animal companion or any other companion (such as a follower; page 76), though if an ability allows you to have more than one follower (such as with the Additional Follower feat of the captain archetype), you can count your horde as one. You have enough control over your horde that it doesn't attack you or your allies.

When raised, your horde is Huge and has a speed of 20 feet. It has the mindless and undead traits. It can be attacked. Though it's made of several undead creatures, it can't share the same space as other creatures (unless you have certain feats). Due to your eldritch connection with your horde, it uses your AC, saves, and other defensive statistics like skill DCs, but is immune to the [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grappled]], [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]], and [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]] conditions. The horde has resistance equal to your level to physical damage, but weakness equal to your level to area and splash damage. You share an animating force, so any damage that would be dealt to the horde is dealt to you instead, though you take damage only once from any ability that includes both you and the horde in the area of effect (though you take the greater amount of damage).

**Trigger** Your last action was a Mobbing Assault made by your horde that reduced at least one living creature to 0 Hit Points.

## [[Feats/Grasping Corpses|Grasping Corpses]] Feat 8

*   archetype

Your foes are left reeling from the attacks made by the zombies or skeletons of your horde. A creature that is damaged by your horde's [[Actions/Mobbing Assault|Mobbing Assault]] is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the beginning of your next turn.

## [[Feats/Shambling March|Shambling March]] Feat 8

## [[Feats/Deathguard|Deathguard]] Feat 10

*   archetype

The twisting rotted limbs, clattering bones, or swirling ectoplasm of your horde can hide you from others' vision. You and your allies can occupy the same space as your horde, becoming [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] to all creatures when you do so.

## [[Feats/Ghostsong|Ghostsong]] Feat 10

*   archetype
*   magical

You have come to understand the pain and fury of spirits and can raise them to do your ghastly work. When you Raise your Horde, you can choose spirits instead of skeletons or zombies. When you do so, your horde gains the incorporeal trait and immunity to disease, poison, and precision damage, and your horde's Mobbing Assault deals void damage.

## [[Feats/Preserve the Horde|Preserve the Horde]] Feat 10

*   archetype
*   concentrate

**Trigger** You cast summon undead.

**Requirements** Your horde is raised.

* * *

The act of summoning additional undead minions doesn't make you lose the focus required to maintain the animation of your horde. You Sustain your horde.

## [[Feats/Danse Macabre|Danse Macabre]] Feat 12

*   archetype
*   concentrate
*   flourish
*   manipulate
*   visual

**Frequency** once per 10 minutes

**Requirements** Your horde is raised.

* * *

Your horde can drag unwilling victims along with it as it shambles forward. Your horde Strides up to its Speed and can move through the spaces of Large and smaller creatures, but it must end its movement in an unoccupied space. Each creature whose space it moves through is subjected to the horde's [[Actions/Mobbing Assault|Mobbing Assault]], attempting a basic Reflex save as usual. A creature who fails the saving throw is also [[Actions/Reposition|Repositioned]] to an unoccupied square of your choice adjacent to the horde's final position. You can't move the creature into or through obstacles.

## [[Feats/Wailing Dead|Wailing Dead]] Feat 12

*   archetype

*   emotion
*   fear
*   flourish
*   magical
*   mental

**Frequency** once per 10 minutes

**Requirements** Your horde is raised and consists of spirits.

* * *

The voices of the spirits you command spark fear in the hearts of your enemies. You Sustain your horde and command those spirits to shriek in unison. Each living enemy within a 20-foot emanation from your horde takes 5d10 mental damage, depending on its `Will check` saving throw against your spell DC. This damage increases by 1d10 at 14th level and every 2 levels thereafter.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature takes half damage and is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]].

**Failure** The creature takes full damage and is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]].

**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 3]].

## [[Feats/Death Rattle|Death Rattle]] Feat 14

*   archetype
*   concentrate
*   magical

**Requirements** Your horde is raised.

* * *

When the time comes for your horde to be returned to its temporary rest, its departure carries those nearby closer to death. Dismiss your raised horde, which draws life energy toward it as it crumbles to the ground and fades away. Each living creature within your horde's space or in a 5-foot emanation around it must attempt a `Fortitude check` saving throw against your spell DC or become [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]] ([[Conditions/Drained|Drained 2]] on a critical failure).

## [[Feats/In the Horde's Grip|In the Horde's Grip]] Feat 14

*   archetype
*   concentrate
*   flourish

When your skeletons and zombies attack, their skeletal claws and rotting hands clutch and tear flesh. Weaker foes are caught in their grip. You command your horde to perform a [[Actions/Mobbing Assault|Mobbing Assault]]. Instead of being [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]], a creature who takes physical damage from failing the saving throw is [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] by your horde ([[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]] on a critical failure). The DC to [[Actions/Escape|Escape]] from your horde is equal to your spell DC. Creatures grabbed by your horde that fail a saving throw against the horde's Mobbing Assault take 2d6 persistent bleed damage.
