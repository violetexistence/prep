*   dedication

**Prerequisites** member of the Bright Lions, not a worshipper of Walkena, trained in Stealth, Bright Lion Background

**Access** Bright Lion background

You become trained in your choice of Deception or Diplomacy and in Mzali Lore; if you were already trained, you become an expert instead. You incorporate enough worship of Walkena in your daily life to avoid suspicion. You typically don't need to [[Actions/Lie|Lie]] or [[Actions/Impersonate|Impersonate]] to pass yourself off as a worshipper of Walkena. Against careful inspection, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to Deception checks specifically to pass yourself off as a version of yourself faithful to Walkena.

If you die, the tattoo immediately casts [[Spells/Peaceful Rest|Peaceful Rest]] on your corpse, heightened to the same spell rank.
