# Bloodrager (Class Archetype)
There is a visceral power in blood. It sustains life through its flow. Bloodragers exist throughout societies in different forms. Matanji orcs are demon hunters that turn the power of fiendish blood against its vessels. The Skoan-Quah protect the tombs of their dead, preserved with containers of their fallen companions' blood. This blood is used by their closest living comrades in combat to utilize lost power and knowledge or drank during festivities to celebrate once more with their companions in battle. In Ustalav, cloaked ministers perform rituals with the blood of extraplanar entities to feed and strengthen their congregation against all manner of maladies and horrors. In Casmaron, divine entities coordinate with mortals to provide their blood as catalysts in wars against hidden threats.

Whatever the path, bloodragers have awakened magical powers to become dangerous forces of physical and magical might wherever there is blood to be found.

## [[Class Features/Bloodrager|Bloodrager]]1st

*   barbarian

You use the power of ingested blood to generate magical power and fuel you in combat, transforming you into a horrifyingly fearsome opponent. You must select Bloodrager Dedication as your 2nd-level class feat.

**Prerequisites:** You must be a barbarian.

**Bloodrager Adjustments:** You are trained in Athletics, Medicine, and a number of additional skills equal to 2 plus your Intelligence modifier, instead of your normal starting skill proficiencies. You must choose the bloodrager instinct for your barbarian instinct.

## Bloodrager Instinct

Drinking the potent magical blood of supernatural creatures has changed you and awakened magical power within you, along with a grim thirst.

**Blood Rage (Instinct Ability):** When raging, your physical attacks deal extra persistent bleed damage equal to half your additional damage from Rage. When you Cast a Spell that requires a spell attack roll while raging, apply the additional damage from Rage to that spell, even on a failure.

**Specialization Ability:** When using blood rage, increase the additional damage from Rage from 2 to 4. If you have greater weapon specialization, instead increase the damage from 4 to 8.

**Raging Resistance:** You resist slashing damage and persistent bleed damage, as well as damage dealt by the creature whose blood you last drank using Harvest Blood (see below), regardless of the damage type.

## [[Feats/Bloodrager Dedication|Bloodrager Dedication]] Feat 2

*   archetype
*   class
*   dedication

**Prerequisites** Bloodrager

* * *

Drinking powerful blood has awakened magical potential within you. You gain a spell repertoire with two cantrips of your choice, from either the arcane or divine spell list. You choose these cantrips from the common spells for your tradition or from other spells you have access to on that tradition's spell list. At least one cantrip must require a spell attack roll. You're trained in spell attack modifier and spell DC. Your key spellcasting attribute for these spells is Charisma. Spells in your repertoire gain the rage trait while you are raging, and when you Cast a Spell from your repertoire, you become [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]] (or increase the value of your drained condition by 1); you can reduce the value of this condition only by [[Actions/Harvest Blood|Harvesting Blood]]. You become trained in Arcana if you chose arcane cantrips or Religion if you chose divine cantrips. If you were already trained in this skill, you become trained in a skill of your choice. You also gain the Harvest Blood action.

## [[Feats/Spelldrinker|Spelldrinker]] Feat 8

*   archetype

**Requirements** Your last action was to Harvest Blood.

**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

You temporarily add a 3rd-rank spell to your spell repertoire, as determined by the type of creature whose blood you just drank (see table below). If the creature has more than one of the listed traits, choose one and gain the appropriate spell. If the granted spell is not on your chosen tradition's list, you cast the spell as though it was from your chosen tradition. The spell is removed from your spell repertoire after 24 hours, the next time you use Spelldrinker, or when you next make your daily preparations, whichever comes first.

## [[Feats/Hematocritical|Hematocritical]] Feat 10

*   archetype

*   rage

**Requirements** Your last action was a Strike that critically hit a creature that isn't immune to bleed damage.

* * *

You bathe in the arterial fluids of your enemy, drinking deep of their freed essence to empower your magic and increase your spellcasting efficacy. If your next action is to Cast a Spell that requires a spell attack roll, you roll the spell attack roll twice and use the better result; this is a fortune effect. Alternatively, if your next action is to cast a spell that requires the creature damaged by the triggering strike to attempt a save, they roll twice and take the lower result; this is a misfortune effect.
