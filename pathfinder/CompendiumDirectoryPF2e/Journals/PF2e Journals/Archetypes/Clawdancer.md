# Clawdancer
Nature provides many creatures weapons for hunting and defense, but few are as common and simple as the claw. Whether for climbing, catching, or rending, claws are an indispensable tool for any limbed denizen of the wild. Humanoid species with these weapons often take pride in such a gift, developing clawed combat into an art.

Catfolk of southern Tian Xia are particularly adept at fighting with their claws. They call their style the Knives of Valash and prioritize rapid strikes mixed with sharp grapples to pin a foe in place. The style's practitioners, sometimes called Knives themselves, patrol the wilds honing their skills against the many dangers there. Once an acolyte rises sufficiently in rank, they're sent out across Golarion to explore and "sharpen their claws." Those who perfect their art over the years often return to Tian Xia to teach the next generation of the style.

You've practiced the art of fighting with your natural claws, hooking them into prey and thrashing at targets surrounding you. You gain the following two actions, which let you assume specific stances to strike more effectively with your claws.

[[Actions/Claw Stance|Claw Stance]] 1 (stance)

**Effect** You extend the claws in your hands and focus your attention to take down single targets. The only Strikes you can make are frenzied claw unarmed attacks.

[[Actions/Talon Stance|Talon Stance]] 1 (stance)

* * *

**Effect** You sway in a loose stance that lets you sweep in wide arcs with the claws on your feet. The only Strikes you can make are spinning talon unarmed attacks. These deal 1d8 slashing damage, are in the brawling group, and have the finesse, sweep, and unarmed traits. You don't need a free hand to use spinning talon strikes.
