# Oatia Skysage
*   Uncommon

The tradition of Oatia skysages stems from a small sect of dedicated stargazers on Castrovel. To better study the celestial mantle, these eccentric astronomers broke away from their Sovyrian kin and migrated to the wild continent of Ukulam, where the night skies were clear of light pollution. Though reclusive, Oatia skysages have been known to pass on their esoteric knowledge and unique worldview to similar-minded adventurers. Such adventuring skysages search for secrets and omens in the stars and can even call down stars' light to aid them in battle.

**Trigger** A creature targets you with an attack and you can see the attacker.

**Frequency** once per hour

**Requirements** You can see the night sky.

Portents written in the night sky show you how to avoid an attack. The triggering attack roll targets your Occultism DC instead of your AC. Though this allows you to avoid taking penalties to your AC, it doesn't remove any conditions or other effects causing such penalties. For example, an enemy with sneak attack would still deal extra damage to you for being [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]], even though you wouldn't take the â€“2 circumstance penalty when defending against the attack.

Whenever an adjacent creature attacks you, the attacker must attempt a `Will check` save against your spell DC at the end of its action. On a failure, it becomes [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] until the end of its next turn. Regardless of the result of the save, the attacker is temporarily immune until the end of its next turn. The dazzling effect has the light and visual traits.

When you reach 17th level, the resistance increases to 10.
