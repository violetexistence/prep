# Herbalist
The plants around you can provide more remedies than the finest hospital or temple, and you are skilled in their use. Nature always provides to those who know how to look, and you have always had a talent for seeing these gifts before you. You can put it to good use, healing those around you with nothing more than what the world provides.

## [[Feats/Herbalist Dedication|Herbalist Dedication]] Feat 2

*   archetype
*   dedication

**Prerequisites** trained in Nature, Natural Medicine

* * *

You can create natural remedies. You gain the [[Compendium.pf2e.journals.JournalEntry.vx5FGEG34AxI2dow.JournalEntryPage.Jkl5KOZih7MoMqAJ]] benefits. You can use advanced alchemy to create 4 alchemical consumables with the healing trait, though the number is reduced by 2 if you didn't make your daily preparations in the wilderness. These consumables are called your herbal items. You remember herbal item formulas and don't need a formula book for them.

You become an expert in Nature and can use Nature instead of Crafting to Craft alchemical consumables with the healing trait. You don't need to be trained in Crafting to do so, and you can use healer's tools instead of alchemist's tools.

## [[Feats/Poultice Preparation|Poultice Preparation]] Feat 4

*   archetype

When you create an herbal elixir, you can prepare it as a poultice instead. A poultice gains the oil trait (but remains alchemical, not magical) and loses the elixir and ingested traits. You can apply a poultice by [[Actions/Interact|Interacting]] with one hand.

When you apply a poultice, in addition to the item's normal effects, the recipient can attempt an immediate flat check to recover from a single source of persistent acid, bleed, or fire damage, with the DC reduction from appropriate assistance.
