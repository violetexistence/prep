# Spirit Warrior
*   Uncommon

Warriors can draw powers from the joy and the sadness in their hearts, spiritual gifts and burdens they can share and give to others. They cultivate experiences from their adventures to nurture and grow their spiritual power, learning to channel it through martial arts techniques tailored to their style and personality. Once they've created a martial art that combines a favored weapon and specialized unarmed techniques, spirit warriors learn to channel spirit energy through their limbs and weapons. Spirit warriors are typically found in the Forest of Spirits, the Chuyokai Forest, and the Valashmai Jungle.
