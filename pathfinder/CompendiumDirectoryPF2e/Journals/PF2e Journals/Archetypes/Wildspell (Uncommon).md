# Wildspell (Uncommon)
*   Uncommon

Magic was woven into the Universe from its creation, a source of power to be tapped by those with the skill, knowledge, or gift. This power isn't distributed evenly, however. Ley lines, mana droughts, and magic storms represent areas where this power waxes and wanes.

Spellcasters usually use tiny fragments of this power in defined, controlled ways, but a few can draw greater amounts than what normal spells require, channeling this energy to fuel diverse effects.

You've tapped into a nigh-unlimited well of magical energy and become so attuned to it that magic flows through the fabric of your being, a trickle of mystic power constantly radiating from you. You might have reached this state through intense study, years of meditation, revelation, as a gift from a powerful entity, or just through the natural progression of your inherent abilities. By accessing this raw power, you can raise the ambient level of magical energy and use it to empower, alter, and hinder spells nearby.

Wildspells are surrounded by faintly visible evidence of their connection, though the precise nature of the manifestation varies with the nature of their magic.

Some have a faint aura that makes colors more intense, others are shadowed by barely perceptible smoke, and others might have garments or hair constantly moving, seemingly of their own accord. Places long inhabited by a wildspell are often home to strange occurrences: small objects animating, weather altered by their mood, plants growing larger, animals with unnatural colorations, and so on.

Wildspells revel in the use of their abilities, knowing that the power they tap into sets them above lesser casters. Most wildspells seek out new ways to shape the energies they unleash, knowing that their control is their only limit.

**Alejandro the Green** (excitable male human druid) poured out raw magic into his forest refuge in the River Kingdoms, over time causing the trees to walk and attracting hordes of curious fey from the First World. With the help of these newly made arboreals and fey visitors, he's been able to drive out numerous hostile invaders. However, his wild magic has recently attracted the attention of malevolent proteans from the Maelstrom, and he'll need more allies than he currently has to keep his home safe from their unpredictable predations.

**Ernhilda Truestone** (patient female dwarf sorcerer) used her wildspell powers to create an oasis of stable magic in the Mana Wastes, allowing her to give succor to harried travelers. Her home in the wastes grew to a bustling trading post, protected by her powers, though it rapidly faded after her passing. Some believe that Ernhilda's spirit now resides in a cave somewhere under the settlement and that she could be brought back to life with the proper ritual. Finding the proper site for such magic has been hindered by the subterranean tunnels, which seem to shift randomly and without warning.

Teachers at the Magaambya are concerned about a young student named **Mkosa** (curious nonbinary halfling student) who has begun to exhibit signs of being a nascent wildspell. They don't wish to hinder Mkosa's education but are afraid of accidental explosions of magic harming others. The teachers haven't informed Mkosa about their worries, and the time to make a decision is rapidly approaching.

Power and magic are yours to unleash, but only time will tell if you can master them to become a true wildspell. You'll undergo trials of the spirit and body that have every chance of breaking you, either tearing your flesh apart with unfiltered magic or breaking your mind with arcane revelations about the Universe. If you survive, your story will be one for the legends.

  

| The Source of Magic |
| --- |
| The wildspell is only for spellcasters, specifically spellcasters who cast spells from spell slots, whether spontaneously or prepared. The source of your wildspell powers could be a magical place, a lost ritual, an arcane discovery from long research, a gift from a higher power, or as part of a pact with an unknown patron. However you come upon these powers, they give you new options for empowering and varying your magic, regardless of tradition. |

## [[Feats/Wildspell Dedication|Wildspell Dedication]] Feat 12

*   Uncommon
*   destiny
*   mythic

**Prerequisites** ability to cast spells from spell slots

* * *

You gain the ability to tap into a powerful well of magic. You gain the [[Spells/Spellsurge|Spellsurge]] focus spell. This spell is of your main casting tradition.

## [[Feats/Burning Surge|Burning Surge]] Feat 14

*   mythic

**Trigger** A creature Casts a Spell within your [[Spells/Spellsurge|Spellsurge]] aura.

* * *

You cause a surge of magical energy to flare up, harming that creature and those near it. The triggering creature and all creatures adjacent to it take 1d6 untyped damage per rank of the spell (`Will check` save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher). The damage is of the same type as dealt by the spell (or one type of damage of your choosing if the spell deals multiple types of damage). If the spell doesn't deal damage, the damage is mental. The effect gains the trait of the damage dealt. If you spend a Mythic Point as part of using this reaction, calculate the DC with mythic proficiency; you can also choose to deal acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage instead of the type that would normally be dealt, and creatures that fail the saving throw take persistent damage of the same type as the base effect equal to the rank of the triggering creature's spell.

## [[Feats/Extend Surge|Extend Surge]] Feat 14

*   concentrate
*   mythic

**Requirements** Your [[Spells/Spellsurge|Spellsurge]] aura is active.

* * *

You tap deeper into the vortex of magical energy within you. Until the start of your next turn, the radius of your _spellsurge_ aura increases to 30 feet. If you spend a Mythic Point as part of this action, the radius increases to 60 feet instead until the start of your next turn and is then 30 feet for the duration of the spell.

## [[Feats/Invigorating Surge|Invigorating Surge]] Feat 14

*   concentrate
*   mythic

**Requirements** Your [[Spells/Spellsurge|Spellsurge]] aura is active.

* * *

You alter the aura of magic surrounding you to protect a nearby ally. You grant one creature within your _spellsurge_ aura temporary Hit Points equal to your level. These temporary Hit Points last for as long as the target is in the aura. Using this ability again cancels the temporary Hit Points from any previous usage. If you spend a Mythic Point as part of this action, you grant the temporary Hit Points to a number of creatures up to half your level that are within the aura.

## [[Feats/Mythic Heightening|Mythic Heightening]] Feat 14

*   concentrate
*   mythic
*   spellshape

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

You overload your minor spells to give them greater effect. Spend a Mythic Point. If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell, that spell is heightened to the highest spell rank that you can cast. Any spell attack roll is made with mythic proficiency, and the spell's DC is calculated with mythic proficiency. The spell slot used to cast the spell isn't changed.

## [[Feats/Spell Network|Spell Network]] Feat 14

*   mythic
*   stance

**Trigger** You cast [[Spells/Spellsurge|Spellsurge]].

* * *

Your aura links your friends together with mystic strands. While you're in this stance, an ally within your _spellsurge_ aura can treat any other ally within the aura as the point of origin for a spell they cast, calculating range and cover from the other creature's space instead of their own. This allows all allied creatures within your _spellsurge_ aura to act as though they're in touch range of each other since each creature is in touch range of itself. Additionally, while you're in this stance, an ally casting a spell that targets only the caster can have that spell affect any other ally within your _spellsurge_ aura instead.

## [[Feats/Imbue Spell|Imbue Spell]] Feat 16

*   concentrate
*   mythic

**Trigger** Your previous action was to Cast a Spell.

* * *

You pass the energy of your magic onto an ally, allowing another to release the spell. Upon completing the Casting of a Spell, instead of the normal effects of the spell, you imbue the energy of that spell to an ally that's adjacent to you or within your [[Spells/Spellsurge|Spellsurge]] aura. You expend the spell, spell slot, or Focus Point as normal. At any time during the next hour, that ally can release the energy of the spell with a single action that has the concentrate and manipulate traits; they don't need to expend any spell slots or Focus Points. All attributes of the spell are determined based on your original casting of the spell, including any spellshape feats used, but the ally is treated as the spellcaster for determining the origin of the spell and for making any choices the spell requires. If the spell must or can be Sustained, your ally takes the action to Sustain it. You can't target yourself with this ability. If the spell isn't released by the ally within 1 hour, the energy dissipates. You can only have one spell imbued at a time; additional uses of this ability cause previously imbued spells to dissipate immediately

## [[Feats/Mystical Flare|Mystical Flare]] Feat 16

*   concentrate
*   light
*   mythic
*   spellshape
*   visual

**Requirements** Your [[Spells/Spellsurge|Spellsurge]] aura is active.

* * *

You release a torrent of magic to fill the air with tiny, distracting explosions of light. All creatures within your _spellsurge_ aura become [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]], and all creatures outside the aura are concealed to creatures within it. However, you can ignore this concealment. This effect lasts until the end of your next turn, but you can extend the duration for an additional round by Sustaining it once per round.

## [[Feats/Rapid Switch|Rapid Switch]] Feat 16

*   mythic

**Frequency** once per round

**Requirements** Your [[Spells/Spellsurge|Spellsurge]] aura is active.

* * *

You've honed your control over your _spellsurge_ aura and can rapidly alter its effects. Sustain _spellsurge_ to choose a different effect for its aura.

## [[Feats/Recharging Transference|Recharging Transference]] Feat 16

*   concentrate
*   mythic

You can break your spells down into raw magical potential and transfer it to an ally. Expend one prepared spell, spell slot, or Focus Point, and choose an adjacent ally or an ally within your [[Spells/Spellsurge|Spellsurge]] aura. If you expended a spell or spell slot, the ally regains one expended spell or spell slot with a rank equal to or lower than the spell or spell slot you expended. If you expended a Focus Point, the ally regains a Focus Point. This feat can't grant more spell slots or Focus Points than the target can normally possess. You can't target yourself with this ability. Only one spell, spell slot, or Focus Point can be transferred with each use of this ability.

## [[Feats/Thundering Surge|Thundering Surge]] Feat 16

*   mythic
*   sonic
*   spellshape

**Requirements** Your [[Spells/Spellsurge|Spellsurge]] aura is active.

* * *

Your magic explodes in bursts of excess energy, creating thunderous waves. If your next action is to Cast a Spell, attempt a `DC 5 Flat check`.

**Critical Success** Enemies within a 10-foot radius burst centered on the target of the spell or within the spell's area of effect take sonic damage equal to twice your level (`Fortitude check` saving throw against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher). Those who fail the save are also knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]].

**Success** Enemies within a 10-foot radius burst centered on the target of the spell or within the spell's area of effect take sonic damage equal to your level (basic Fortitude saving throw against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher). Those who critically fail the save are also knocked prone.

**Failure** All creatures within a 10-foot radius burst centered on you take sonic damage equal to your level (basic Fortitude saving throw against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher). Those who fail the save are also knocked prone.

## [[Feats/Galvanize Spell|Galvanize Spell]] Feat 18

*   concentrate
*   mythic
*   spellshape

**Frequency** once per day

**Requirements** Your [[Spells/Spellsurge|Spellsurge]] aura is active.

* * *

You reabsorb the magic of your _spellsurge_ aura to power a piece of powerful magic. Spend a Mythic Point. Your _spellsurge_ ends. If your next action is to Cast a Spell that's at least 2 ranks lower than the highest spell slot you have, you reduce the number of actions to cast it by 1 (minimum 1 action). You then immediately regain the ability to cast that spell again (with the normal parameters) or the spell slot used.

## [[Feats/Mana Detonation|Mana Detonation]] Feat 18

*   mythic

You can violently discorporate your form. You gain the [[Spells/Arcane Explosion|Arcane Explosion]] focus spell.

_Source: Pathfinder War of Immortals_

## [[Feats/Mythic Counter|Mythic Counter]] Feat 18

*   mythic

You can overwhelm the magical designs of others with sheer magic power. When you attempt a counteract check against a spell, you can spend a Mythic Point to attempt the check at mythic proficiency. If the target of the counteract check is within your [[Spells/Spellsurge|Spellsurge]] aura, critical failures on this check are treated as failures.

## [[Feats/Mystic Life Force|Mystic Life Force]] Feat 20

*   Uncommon
*   mythic

Magic energy sustains you, supporting your form far beyond the capabilities of mere flesh. You can't die except due to old age as long as you're under the effects of an ongoing spell or within your [[Spells/Spellsurge|Spellsurge]] aura; if your [[Conditions/Dying|Dying]] or [[Conditions/Doomed|Doomed]] condition would increase to a high enough value to kill you, it doesn't increase, and any effect that would instantly kill you instead just reduces you to 0 Hit Points.

If you die for any reason, you transform into a magical font attached to an allied creature of your choice within 1 mile. This creature gains knowledge of the [[Spells/Embodied Font|Embodied Font]] ritual to return you to your corporeal state. Until you're restored, once per hour, you can cast _spellsurge_, centered on the chosen creature. You still make all choices for the _spellsurge_ and can take actions allowed by the spell, though you can take no other actions.

## [[Feats/Surging Interference|Surging Interference]] Feat 20

*   mythic

**Trigger** A creature Casts a Spell within your [[Spells/Spellsurge|Spellsurge]] aura.

* * *

You absorb the scattered energy of others' failed spells, using it to recharge your own magic. You attempt to counteract the spell. If you're successful, you absorb the dispersed magical energy, regaining one spell or spell slot of 8th rank or lower of your choice. If you spend a Mythic Point when you successfully counteract the triggering creature's spell, you instead regain a 9th-rank spell or spell slot of your choice.

# Wildspell Spells

## [[Spells/Spellsurge|Spellsurge]] Focus 9

*   uncommon
*   concentrate
*   focus
*   mythic

Magic surges to life around you, feeding on the raw power you radiate. Choose one of the following abilities to affect creatures in your aura. You can choose a different effect, ending the previous one, by Sustaining the spell. You can Dismiss the aura.

*   **Interference** The excess magic surrounding you creates a mental static. All saving throws against mental effects gain a +2 circumstance bonus.
*   **Mana Well** You become a source of pure magic that allows spells to be cast more freely. Allied creatures that would normally be required to attempt a flat check to Cast a Spell (such as from the [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied]] condition) automatically succeed.
*   **Overpower Resistance** Surging magic penetrates most defenses. Any time a spell affects a creature within the aura, that spell ignores an amount of the creature's resistance equal to your level. This applies to all damage the spell deals, including persistent damage and damage caused by an ongoing effect of the spell. This doesn't cause the spell to ignore immunities.
*   **Ward** Stray magical energy diffuses damaging spells. Any time a spell affects a creature within the aura, the damage dealt by the spell is reduced by an amount equal to your level. This applies to all damage the spell deals, including persistent damage and damage caused by an ongoing effect of the spell.

## [[Spells/Arcane Explosion|Arcane Explosion]] Focus 9

*   uncommon
*   concentrate
*   force
*   manipulate
*   mythic

Your body is temporarily converted into a ball of pure magic, rapidly exploding outward and reforming as a glowing sphere, after which you eventually regain your normal form. All creatures and objects in the emanation take 16d6 force damage (basic Fortitude saving throw). Creatures that fail are also pushed 10 feet directly away from you; creatures that can't complete this forced movement are knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] (but creatures who reduce this movement, such as with an ability or feat, don't fall prone). You become unfiltered magic; you gain the incorporeal trait, are immune to disease, poison, and precision damage, and gain resistance to all damage equal to your level (except force damage, spirit damage, and damage from Strikes with the [[Equipment/Ghost Touch|Ghost Touch]] property rune), with double the resistance against non-magical damage. While incorporeal, you can't Strike, Cast a Spell, or take any actions with the manipulate trait. Any creature that ends its turn adjacent to you while you're in this state takes 6d6 force damage. You remain as pure magic until you Dismiss your new form, returning to your normal state at maximum Hit Points.

**Critical Success** The target materializes within range, with full Hit Points, 1 Mythic Point, and as if having just completed daily preparations.

**Success** As critical success, but all the target's spells and spell slots are expended.

**Failure** As success, but the target is [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]], [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 1]], [[Conditions/Doomed|Doomed 1]], and [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 1]] for 1 week.
