# Blackjacket
*   uncommon

Members of the Mercenary League undergo some of the best military training in Golarion. Recruits might come in with little experience, but all leave with the capacity to act as a personal bodyguard, to operate within a security detail, or to defend their nation as part of an army. They're not just physically capable fighters; they're excellent strategists who can make difficult tactical decisions in the heat of battle.

**Additional Feats: 4th** Intimidating Strike; **6th Reactive Striker**; **8th** Shatter Defenses

## [[Feats/Mercenary Motivation|Mercenary Motivation]] Feat 4

*   archetype
*   concentrate
*   exploration

A large part of being in the Mercenary League entails doing mercenary work. You spend 1 minute planning a course of action that will allow you to complete a task you've been hired or requested to do. Work with your GM to determine the circumstances of any job or task if need be, but typically, they can involve protecting a place or person, defeating a foe or enemy force, or retrieving an item. The course of action you plan must be something you believe you can accomplish.

**Active Plan** You can have only one course of action planned at a time. If you use Mercenary Motivation to plan a second course of action, you no longer receive the bonus to checks related to the first course of action.

**On the Job** Whenever you attempt a Perception check or skill check that will advance your course of action, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the check. The exact checks this bonus applies to depend on your current job and are determined by the GM.

**Finishing a Plan** When you complete the course of action you planned to do, you don't lose the bonus or other benefits until you make a different plan with Mercenary Motivation or voluntarily Dismiss the current plan.

You telegraph your next attack to let your allies in on your strategy. Make a melee or ranged Strike with a â€“2 circumstance penalty.

## [[Feats/Nothing Personal|Nothing Personal]] Feat 8

*   archetype
*   concentrate

**Requirements** You have an active course of action planned.

* * *

When you're on a job, you can't allow anyone to stop you. Designate a single creature you can see as being an impediment to your active course of action. The first time you Strike your impediment in a round, you deal an extra die of weapon damage. At 14th level, this increases to two extra dice, and at 20th level, this increases to three extra dice.

You can have only one creature designated as an impediment at a time. If you use Nothing Personal against a creature when you already have a creature designated, the prior creature loses the designation, and the new impediment gains the designation. Otherwise, your designation lasts for 1 hour.
