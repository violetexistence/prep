# Gelid Shard
The Varki wizard T'aak Chamin once traveled from the Lands of the Linnorm Kings northward, past the Winterwall Glacier and deep into the frozen wastes of the Crown of the World. T'aak was seeking immortality without the risk of undeath, and he followed the hints and clues of ancient legends that spoke of "the frozen immortals," and of ancient magics of ice crafting that were once commonly traded between these rumored immortals and the Erutaki people, who share ancestral roots with the Varki.

Little is known of T'aak's journeys in the northern wastes, though all accounts that record anything of the wizard and his trek indicate that the man who returned was different in many ways than the man who first traveled north. T'aak spoke of beings known as saumen kar, of a "great whale" sealed beneath the ice, and of strange corruptions. An account left by his wife mentions that T'aak often awoke screaming about "malignant sludge" and a "disease clawing at the ancient gates." Despite all this, T'aak's primary quest did result in at least one notable accomplishment: the crafting of the first _gelid shard_.

_Gelid shards_ are arcane focuses of refined magical cold in physical form. Unfortunately for their creator, gelid shards do not grant immortality, though mortal creatures bonded to them do often have slightly longer lifespans thanks to the preserving cold that inundates and surrounds them.

## [[Equipment/Gelid Shard|Gelid Shard]] Item 2

*   rare
*   arcane
*   artifact
*   cold
*   invested

This crystal shard shimmers with its own light even as it seems to draw the heat out of its surroundings. Plunging it into your heart grants you the tranquil lethality of deepest winter, but the more you draw upon its power, the colder your heart grows. Your frozen heart dulls your emotions. When you gain a bonus from an emotion effect, that bonus is reduced by 1, to a minimum of 0. At 10th level, the bonus is reduced by 2. Your dulled emotions make it hard to relate to others; the DC of checks to [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] or [[Actions/Request|Request]] a favor of other creatures, or to Aid in such attempts, is increased by +2. You gain resistance to cold equal to your level and a +2 status bonus to all saves against emotion effects.

**Destruction** The _gelid shard_ must be left exposed in the Plane of Fire for a week and a day, then smashed with an adamantine hammer by someone who felt true love for the shard's creator.

## [[Feats/First Frost|First Frost]] Feat 2

*   archetype

The gelid shard within your heart may sap your ability to feel and experience emotion, but it also lets you create and manipulate cold. You learn to cast arcane spontaneous spells, and you gain a spell repertoire with the [[Spells/Frostbite|Frostbite]] and [[Spells/Frost's Touch|Frost's Touch]] cantrips. You're trained in spell attack modifier and spell DC. Your key spellcasting attribute is Charisma.

## [[Feats/Snowcaster|Snowcaster]] Feat 4

*   archetype

Your magical power grows as the shard's icy influence spreads ever deeper into your being. You gain the basic spellcasting benefits. Each time you gain a spell slot of a new level from this archetype, add a spell of the appropriate spell rank (including heightened versions of lower-rank spells) to your repertoire, either a common spell of the arcane tradition that has the cold trait or another cold spell you have access to.

## [[Feats/Snow Step|Snow Step]] Feat 6

*   archetype

Snow and ice are no hindrance to you. You ignore difficult terrain caused by snow and ice, treat greater difficult terrain created by snow and ice as difficult terrain, and leave no tracks when moving through areas of snow or ice.

## [[Feats/Frozen Breadth|Frozen Breadth]] Feat 8

*   archetype

Your attunement to arcane cold enhances the depths of your growing power. Increase the number of spells in your repertoire and number of spell slots you gain from _gelid shard_ archetype feats by 1 for each spell rank other than your two highest _gelid shard_ spell slots.

## [[Feats/Winter's Embrace|Winter's Embrace]] Feat 10

*   archetype

Your eyes are accustomed to the harsh glare of the sun on snow and ice. You gain a +1 status bonus to saving throws against effects that inflict the [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] condition. Snow doesn't impair your vision; you ignore concealment from snowfall. Your skin becomes cold to the touch, and sometimes frost forms on you. You are protected from severe cold and heat.

## [[Feats/Winter's Kiss|Winter's Kiss]] Feat 14

*   archetype

Whether in the heart of a volcanic passageway or the glacial tundras of the Crown of the World, the only temperature you ever personally experience is an oddly comfortable chill. You are now protected from extreme cold and extreme heat, and you gain resistance to fire equal to half your level. If you would already have resistance to fire equal to half your level from a heritage, ancestry feat, class feat, or another archetype feat, you instead gain resistance to fire equal to your level.

# Spells

## [[Spells/Frost's Touch|Frost's Touch]] Cantrip 1

*   rare
*   arcane
*   cold
*   conjuration

Cast 1

Range 30 feet; Targets 1 object

* * *

Your _gelid shard_ drinks down nearby heat in a futile attempt to sate itself and achieve a level of frigid cold unheard of in the Universe. This allows you to cool a drink, make a hot pot safe to handle, or other, similar minor effects. Once cooled, the object's temperature is subject to its environment as usual. You can also solidify ambient moisture into a solid object; this temporary object is of negligible Bulk, made of non-magical ice. The object looks crude and artificial and is extremely fragileâ€”it can't be used as a tool, weapon, or locus or cost for a spell. Once created, it melts as normal for ice for the ambient conditions.

* * *

**Heightened (3rd)** You can create simple objects of ice with up to 1 Bulk and of a level not exceeding 1. Such objects must be rigid. You can only have one such object created at a time; if you create another, the previous object melts instantly.

**Heightened (5th)** Items you create can be up to 4 Bulk and 4th level.

**Heightened (7th)** Items you create can be up to 8 Bulk and 8th level.

**Heightened (9th)** Items you create can be up to 20 Bulk and 12th level.
