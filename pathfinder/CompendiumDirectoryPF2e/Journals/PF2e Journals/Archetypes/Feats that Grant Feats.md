# Feats that Grant Feats
Sometimes an archetype feat lets you select another feat, such as a class feat of a lower level. You must always meet any prerequisites of the feat you gain in this way. These always count as only one feat for the purposes of your dedication; for example, taking the barbarian archetype's Basic Fury feat to gain the Sudden Charge class feat counts as only one feat, not two.
