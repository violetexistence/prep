# Cavalier
You are a skilled and dedicated warrior on the battlefield who specializes in fighting astride a powerful animal companion that serves as your mount. You and your mount are an unparalleled team, moving with shared intent to become a powerful force in combat. You might wield a banner in the name of an order of which you're a member, a liege to whom you've sworn your service, or an ideal you uphold. Or you might fight solely to further enrich your own prestige, reputation, and coffers. Traditionally, cavaliers are envisioned riding atop majestic or fearsome horses, but in reality, all kinds of animals can serve this honorable role, from riding dogs to dinosaurs. What's important is not the type of mount but the connection between the cavalier and their companion. This bond is their true strength.

  

| Cavalier Pledges |
| --- |
| Many cavaliers pledge themselves in service to a specific organization or individual, such as a noble family or sovereign ruler, a knightly order or another organization, or particular ideal. A cavalier pledged to an order or ideal must uphold its edicts and is beholden to any anathema it has; for example, a cavalier pledged to the druid's animal order would be tied to that anathema, while a cavalier pledged to the church of Abadar would be held to the same standards as a cleric of that god. If you pledge yourself to an entity or cause without a stated anathema, you should work with your GM to determine the edicts and anathema associated with your pledge. Cavaliers who have pledged themselves can gain access to certain abilities related to that pledge, such as Cavalier's Banner. If you violate the anathema of your pledge, you lose access to those feats until you benefit from an _[[Spells/Atone\|Atone]]_ ritual. Changing the subject of your pledge is equivalent to retraining a class feature. |

## [[Feats/Cavalier Dedication|Cavalier Dedication]] Feat 2

*   archetype
*   dedication

**Prerequisites** trained in Nature or Society

* * *

You gain a young animal companion that serves as your mount. You can choose from animal companions with the mount special ability, as well as any additional options from your pledge (see Cavalier Pledges), as determined by your GM. You must choose an animal companion that's at least one size larger than you, but if the animal usually starts as Small, you can begin with a Medium version of that animal (changing no statistics other than its size).

* * *

**Special** If you have pledged yourself to a cause, you can take a second dedication feat closely tied to that cause even if you haven't taken two additional Cavalier feats. For instance, if you pledged yourself to fight crime with a group of vigilantes, you could take the vigilante dedication without first completing the cavalier archetype. The GM determines what archetypes, if any, are valid choices.

**CAVALIER PLEDGES**

Many cavaliers pledge themselves in service to a specific organization or individual, such as a noble family or sovereign ruler, a knightly order or another organization, or a particular ideal. A cavalier pledged to an order or ideal must uphold its edicts and is beholden to any anathema it has; for example, a cavalier pledged to the druid's animal order would be tied to that anathema, while a cavalier pledged to the church of Abadar would be held to the same standards as a cleric of that god. If you pledge yourself to an entity or cause without a stated anathema, you should work with your GM to determine the edicts and anathema associated with your pledge.

Cavaliers who have pledged themselves can gain access to certain abilities related to that pledge, such as Cavalier's Banner. If you violate the anathema of your pledge, you lose access to those feats until you benefit from an [[Spells/Atone|Atone]] ritual. Changing the subject of your pledge is equivalent to retraining a class feature.
