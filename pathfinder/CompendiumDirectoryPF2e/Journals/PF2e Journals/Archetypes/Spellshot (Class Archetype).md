# Spellshot (Class Archetype)
*   Uncommon

Spellshots aren't ordinary gunslingers. They come from a tradition of ancient secrets and principles, which they temper with modern innovation and perspective. Spellshots combine magical power into the art of gunplay to create a distinct and mystical way known only to spellshots, enigmatic and unavailable to other gunslingers. The first to identify themselves as spellshots tied their magical traditions to the history of the Star Code and the Crowned Regents in Arcadia. Ancient, reclusive crafters known as the Crowned Regents created star guns, the legendary magical firearms that shoot white-hot blasts of energy. Wielders of star guns became bound together by the Star Codeâ€”a set of cultural expectations that defined how one should behave while using these powerful weapons. You can find more information about star guns, the Crowned Regents, and the Star Code in Guns & Gears. While spellshot traditions spread from Arcadia, they're still rare in the Inner Sea region.

## [[Class Features/Way of the Spellshot|Way of the Spellshot]] 1st

*   uncommon
*   gunslinger

You've learned the intricacies of magic and technology, blending the two together with deadly results. You combine a knowledge of arcane theories with a strong connection to your chosen weapon that allows you to manifest unique effects, combining deadly skill with a firearm alongside an array of moderate spellcasting. You can imbue energy into your weapon and conjure bullets from thin air. As you progress, you eventually learn to phase bullets through walls or even to teleport yourself along the path of your bullets. You must select [[Feats/Spellshot Dedication|Spellshot Dedication]] as your 2nd-level class feat.

**Prerequisites** You must be a gunslinger.

**Spellshot Adjustments** Instead of choosing a way from the options listed in the gunslinger class, you have the way of the spellshot. It has the following way skill, slinger's reload, and deeds. You gain these abilities at the same levels as normal for the class. You use Intelligence for your class DC.

**Way Skill** Arcana

**Slinger's Reload** [[Actions/Thoughtful Reload|Thoughtful Reload]]

**Deeds** _Initial_ [[Actions/Energy Shot|Energy Shot]]; _Advanced_ [[Actions/Recall Ammunition|Recall Ammunition]]; _Greater_ [[Actions/Dispelling Bullet|Dispelling Bullet]]

You cast arcane spells like a wizard, gaining a spellbook with four common arcane cantrips of your choice. You gain the Cast a Spell activity. You can prepare two cantrips each day from your spellbook. You're trained in the spell attack modifier and spell DC statistics. Your key spellcasting attribute for spellshot archetype spells is Intelligence, and they are arcane spells. You become trained in Arcana; if you were already trained in Arcana, you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. This counts as the wizard archetype for the prerequisites of [[Feats/Basic Wizard Spellcasting|Basic Wizard Spellcasting]].

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat other than [[Feats/Beast Gunner Dedication|Beast Gunner Dedication]] until you've gained two other feats from the [[PF2e Journals/Archetypes/Spellshot|Spellshot]] or [[PF2e Journals/Archetypes/Beast Gunner|Beast Gunner]] archetypes.

## [[Feats/Phase Bullet|Phase Bullet]] Feat 14

*   archetype
*   magical

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

You can aim your bullets not just in three normal dimensions, but in additional dimensions as well, removing all obstacles between you and your target. Attempt a crossbow or firearm Strike against a foe who's observed or [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] to you (but not undetected). The ammunition travels to your target in a straight line, passing through any non-magical barriers or walls in its way, though magical barriers and force effects stop the bullet. The shot ignores all cover, the [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] condition, the hidden condition, and circumstance bonuses to AC from shields. It has a +4 status bonus to hit creatures wearing any type of armor. The Strike's damage can't be reduced with a Shield Block reaction using a non-magical shield.
