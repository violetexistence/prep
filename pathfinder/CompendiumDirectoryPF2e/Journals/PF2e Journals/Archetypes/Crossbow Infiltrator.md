# Crossbow Infiltrator
*   Uncommon

Crossbow infiltrators are typically highly trained members of specialized units or organizations who favor stealthy tactics and quiet weapons. Whether you were trained as an assassin, a spy, or for some other purpose related to espionage and infiltration, you specialize in using unobtrusive forms of crossbow weaponry to eliminate targets.

While all crossbow infiltrators learn to use the hand crossbow and gauntlet bow, some take part in more aggressive and dangerous infiltrations and request specialized equipment like the repeating hand crossbow or crescent cross—a unique weapon that combines a bladed gauntlet with an arm-mounted crossbow apparatus—to complete their objectives. It's also incredibly common for crossbow infiltrators to either have access to poisons and poison training from the organizations they serve, or to have their own supplier to supplement their tool sets.

The use of small, easily [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] or disposed-of weapons and tools makes it easy for crossbow infiltrators to slip into a location unnoticed, complete whatever objective they have been given, and then slip away without being detected, either climbing over a castle wall or blending into a crowded marketplace.

# Crossbow Infiltrators in the Inner Sea

Most crossbow infiltrators in the Inner Sea region of Golarion come from either Ustalav, where the techniques started as a specialized form of vampire hunting, or the Five Kings Mountains, where dwarven ingenuity spurred the advancement of several kinds of specialized crossbows.

Other crossbow infiltrators typically come from nations close to one of these two locations, where the equipment and techniques spread along trade routes. Andoran and Taldor both include "special operations" units within their military and espionage hierarchies; the members of such units are supplied with specialized equipment from their nations' dwarven allies that is then supplemented with deadly poisons that dwarven engineers didn't consider implementing due to their own ancestral resistance to poisonous substances.

## [[Feats/Lethargy Poisoner|Lethargy Poisoner]] Feat 8
