# Ghoul
*   Rare

You died from the necrotic disease known as ghoul fever and rose anew as a ravenous ghoul, forever craving the flesh of sapient creatures. While you can temper your hunger with long-dead flesh stolen from ancient graves, you much prefer devouring those who are freshly dead, whether as a scavenger or because you killed the creature yourself to ensure a fresh meal.

Whether they stalk through the graveyards and crypts of Golarion or work together with other ghouls to build empires in the Darklands, ghouls care most about the consumption of dead flesh. The moment you become a ghoul, your existence focuses upon satisfying this endless craving. Ghouls who go more than a few days without feeding on freshly dead humanoid flesh find themselves in constant pain; those who go for more than a week might be driven to the edge of delirium, becoming bestial in their craving.

When you succumb to ghoul fever and become a ghoul, you don't lose your mind or memories. You keep your personality only to have it warped by the never-ending need to consume flesh. A brave warrior remains brave, but under the curse of the fever, that brave warrior's prime directive is to consume flesh. A rogue might go from finding clever ways to pick pockets to finding ways to waylay opponents and devour them.

Since most societies don't allow cannibalism, ghouls who wish to continue their old lives must satisfy their cravings in secret, finding a way to balance society's rules while feeding the constant gnawing hunger inside them. Some take up professions that allow them to secretly eat dead flesh or create dead bodies to feed upon. There are tales told of ghoul mercenary troops who satisfy their cravings and profit, while ghoul spellcasters can use their magic to procure and preserve flesh.

Ghouls who won't restrain themselves with rules of the living may join or establish ghoul societies. These caste systems base their hierarchy on how much flesh one has consumed and can provide for other ghouls. Hunger and ambition drive ghouls to rise through the ranks, which allows them to feed their hunger even more.

## [[Feats/Ghoul Dedication|Ghoul Dedication]] Feat 2

*   Rare
*   archetype
*   dedication

**Prerequisites** You were killed by ghoul fever.

* * *

You have succumbed to ghoul fever, dying and returning as a ghoul, an undead cursed with a never-ending hunger for dead flesh that slowly overrides your reason and willpower until you would do anything for the meal you crave. In addition to the personality changes, your body changes as well. Your ears become pointed, and your skin grows blueish and pale. Your fingernails sharpen into claws; your teeth become razor sharp, ready to tear flesh off the bone; and your tongue grows long and pointed.

You gain the ghoul and undead traits and the [[Ancestry Features/Basic Undead Benefits|Basic Undead Benefits]]. Your undead craving is for the flesh of dead creatures; freshly dead corpses from sapient creatures fulfill your cravings much more than non-sapient or rotted corpses, but any dead creature can stave off the hunger for at least a little while. You gain two unarmed attacks in the brawling weapon group. The first unarmed attack is a claw that deals 1d4 slashing damage with the agile and finesse traits, and the second unarmed attack is a set of jaws that deal 1d6 piercing damage and have the finesse trait.

You gain the [[Actions/Consume Flesh|Consume Flesh]] action. Satisfying your craving is difficult. Consuming Flesh temporarily satiates you. Many ghoul feats have extra abilities or functions that can be used when you are satiated, though using those abilities also causes you to lose your satiated status. You can always Consume Flesh, but eating more than a normal amount has no further effect; a ghoul's hunger is satiated, or it is not.

## [[Feats/Replenishing Consumption|Replenishing Consumption]] Feat 4

*   archetype

When you devour corpses and satiate your hunger, you also recover from some of your wounds, your necrotized blue flesh knitting back together almost immediately as soon as you begin shoveling the chunks of dead flesh down your throat. Once every 10 minutes, when you [[Actions/Consume Flesh|Consume Flesh]], you regain 1d6 Hit Points for every 2 levels you have, rounded up. Leveled Healing

## [[Feats/Swift Leap|Swift Leap]] Feat 4

*   archetype

Your undead physiology allows you to leap quickly toward or away from your opponent. You [[Actions/Leap|Leap]]. This movement doesn't trigger reactions.

If you are satiated, you can choose to end your satiation to instead [[Actions/High Jump|High Jump]] or [[Actions/Long Jump|Long Jump]] without triggering reactions, as you take a quick, enormous jump before any foe can react to your movement.

## [[Feats/Feverish Enzymes|Feverish Enzymes]] Feat 6

*   archetype

Your claws and fangs exude an infectious enzyme, related to the necrotic effects of ghoul fever, that causes a creature's wounds to heal slowly. Strike with your claw or jaws. This attack deals void damage instead of its normal type; on a hit, the target halves any healing it receives until the start of your next turn. The target or an adjacent ally can spend two interact actions to squeeze the enzymes from the wound and remove the effect.

If you are satiated, when you hit you can choose to end your satiation and boost your enzymes, increasing the duration to 1 minute.

## [[Feats/Grave Strength|Grave Strength]] Feat 6

*   archetype

The flesh you've consumed over the course of your existence as a ghoul has made you stronger, gifting you with strange insights from the minds of the sapient creatures you've devoured and bringing you closer to a state of undead perfection. You gain the [[Ancestry Features/Advanced Undead Benefits|Advanced Undead Benefits]]. In addition, you gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speed while you're satiated.

## [[Feats/Paralyzing Slash|Paralyzing Slash]] Feat 8

*   archetype
*   incapacitation
*   occult

Your enzymes can paralyze your foes rather than merely making it harder for them to heal their wounds. Strike with your claw or jaws. If you hit a living non-elf creature, it becomes [[Conditions/Paralyzed|Paralyzed]] unless it succeeds at a `Fortitude check` save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. Regardless of the result of the save, the creature is temporarily immune to Paralyzing Slash for 24 hours. A creature that becomes paralyzed can attempt a new save to end the paralysis at the end of each of its turns, and the DC cumulatively decreases by 1 on each such save.

## [[Feats/Sickening Bite|Sickening Bite]] Feat 8

*   archetype

Your saliva causes severe nausea and mild fever in the living, weakening them so that you can more easily finish them off. When you critically hit a creature with your jaws, the creature is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]]. This is a disease effect.

If you are satiated, you can end your satiation to make the target [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] on a regular hit instead.

## [[Feats/Flailtongue|Flailtongue]] Feat 10

*   archetype

Your tongue has mutated into a lashing weapon reminiscent of Kabriri's bone-laden flail. You can use a free action to unhinge your lower jaw and sprout rigid bones from your tongue. You gain an unarmed attack that deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage. Until you use an Interact action to reset your jaw and retract your tongue, you can't make a jaws Strike. Your flailtongue is in the flail weapon group and has the disarm, sweep, and trip traits.

## [[Feats/Glutton for Flesh|Glutton for Flesh]] Feat 10

*   archetype

You have developed a capacity to store more flesh within your gaunt body to leave yourself satiated longer. If you [[Actions/Consume Flesh|Consume Flesh]] while satiated, you become fully satiated. You stay fully satiated for 3 hours, after which you become satiated for 1 hour. If you're fully satiated when an ability would end your satiation, you cease being fully satiated but remain satiated. If you have [[Feats/Grave Strength|Grave Strength]], you gain a +10-foot status bonus to your Speed when fully satiated instead of a +5-foot status bonus for being satiated.

## [[Feats/Grave Sight|Grave Sight]] Feat 10

*   archetype

Your ability to sense undead has improved. You sense undead as an imprecise sense with a range of 60 feet: an uncomfortable sensation brushes against your spirit and stinks of rot. When in proximity to an undead, you can sense its presence, but it has the [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] condition instead of the [[Conditions/Observed|Observed]] condition. An undead using a disguise or otherwise trying to hide its presence must attempt a Deception or Stealth check against your Perception DC to hide its presence from you. If the creature succeeds, it's undetected, and you have to use the [[Actions/Seek|Seek]] basic action to detect the creature. As with hearing and other imprecise senses, you still need to Seek to locate an undetected creature.

## [[Feats/Competitive Eater|Competitive Eater]] Feat 12

*   archetype

Gorging on flesh after your stomach is full fortifies you, making you hardy enough to withstand more punishment. When you become fully satiated, you gain an amount of temporary Hit Points equal to 10 + your level.

## [[Feats/Corpse Stench|Corpse Stench]] Feat 12

*   archetype
*   aura
*   olfactory

Your body exudes an overwhelming scent of decay in a 10-foot emanation, so putrid that it nauseates creates within that range. Any creature that starts its turn in the aura must succeed at a `Fortitude check` save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher, or be [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] (plus [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] on a critical failure). While within the aura, the creature takes a -2 circumstance penalty to saves against disease and to recover from the sickened condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune to Corpse Stench for 1 minute.

## [[Feats/Secret Eater|Secret Eater]] Feat 12

*   Rare
*   archetype

You have discovered and found favor with the cult within the church of Kabriri known as the Secret Eaters. You have maggots that writhe under your skin with the power to wriggle out from between your teeth, glean secrets from those you devour, and whisper them telepathically into your mind. Once per hour when you Consume Flesh, you can select a single Intelligence-, Wisdom-, or Charisma-based skill whose secrets you wish to uncover. You become subject to the effects of corpse communion as if you had critically succeeded at casting the ritual: you learn a significant piece of lore, a forgotten secret, or some other tantalizing nugget of knowledge that is of immediate use to you.

## [[Feats/Tunneling Claws|Tunneling Claws]] Feat 12

*   archetype

You have elongated claws and enhanced senses, making you uncanny at digging the underground passageways needed to construct ghoul warrens and rob graves without arousing suspicion. You gain a burrow Speed of 15 feet and a tremorsense (imprecise) of 60 feet. You can [[Actions/Burrow|Burrow]] through any earthen matter, including rock, while moving at your full burrow Speed. When you move in this way, you can choose either to leave tunnels behind you that are large enough to allow creatures of your size or smaller to move through them or move through the ground while leaving no tunnels or signs of your passing.

## [[Feats/Bodysnatcher|Bodysnatcher]] Feat 14

*   Rare
*   archetype
*   divine
*   polymorph

Your secret-stealing maggots reveal how to devour more than just the flesh and secrets of a victim; you can ingest and assume their whole physical appearance. When you [[Actions/Consume Flesh|Consume Flesh]] of a creature of your size or smaller, you can assume the physical form of the creature immediately after becoming satiated or fully satiated. Using Bodysnatcher counts as creating a disguise for the Impersonate use of Deception. Your transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine you are a member of the ancestry or creature type into which you transformed, and you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to your Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through your disguise. You do not gain the special abilities, skills, voice, memories, or other characteristics of the creature you consumed, only their physical form. Unlike Change Shape, Bodysnatcher can be used to gain the appearance of a specific individual whose flesh you've consumed. This effect lasts until you are no longer satiated and can only be used once per individual creature.

## [[Feats/Graveshift|Graveshift]] Feat 14

*   Rare
*   archetype
*   divine
*   teleportation

**Frequency** Once per day

**Requirements** You are standing at the bottom of an open grave adjacent to up to four willing target creatures or objects roughly the size of a creature.

* * *

The maggots inhabiting your body impart you with the knowledge to travel from grave to grave, drawing upon the mystical power of the labyrinthine network of magical warrens and tunnels that connect Everglut to the Material Plane. You can spend 10 minutes channeling this power to transport you and all target creatures or objects that are inside the grave you are standing in to a chosen grave you are aware of (unoccupied or occupied) within 100 miles. When you target an occupied or filled grave, you and all transported creatures and objects appear scattered aboveground around the targeted grave (or belowground in adjacent tunnels or passageways if available).

## [[Feats/Breath of Hungry Death|Breath of Hungry Death]] Feat 16

*   Rare
*   acid
*   archetype
*   divine
*   incapacitation
*   occult

**Frequency** Once per hour

* * *

You have uncovered occult mysteries that allow you to unleash the devastating hunger of Kabriri upon your foes with a single exhalation, releasing a massive cloud of flesh-eating gas that glows with a sickly green light. You deal 7d6 acid and 7d6 void damage to all creatures within a 30-foot cone (`Reflex check` save with a DC equal to your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher). A creature that gets a critical failure on this Reflex save is also [[Conditions/Paralyzed|Paralyzed]] for 1 round. A creature that succeeds at this save becomes temporarily immune to Breath of Hungry Death for 24 hours.

When a creature is killed using Breath of Hungry Death, its body is reduced to a smoldering pile of ash wafting with necrotic fumes. You can use a reaction to immediately inhale these fumes and become satiated or fully satiated as if you had used Consume Flesh.

## [[Feats/Wrath of the First Ghoul|Wrath of the First Ghoul]] Feat 20

*   Rare
*   archetype
*   death
*   divine
*   flourish
*   mental
*   occult

**Frequency** Once per day

* * *

The ravenous maggots inside you become capable of exploding forth from your attacks into the wounds of an opponent, whispering telepathic words of destruction that invoke horrific flashbacks of Kabriri's transformation from elf to ghoul or psychic images of hundreds of maggots bursting from the victim's flesh all at once. Make a melee Strike against a target creature. If it hits, in addition to taking damage from the Strike, the target is affected by a 10th-rank casting of [[Spells/Power Word Kill|Power Word Kill]]. If Wrath of the First Ghoul is used against a target elf, Leng ghoul, or worshipper of Pharasma and does not instantly kill the creature, the target takes double damage.
