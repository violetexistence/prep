# Palatine Detective (Class Archetype)
*   Uncommon

You are an elite agent of the Esoteric Order of the Palatine Eye. Separated from the regular members of this obscure league of scholars and academics, you have attained divine and occult abilities through methods kept secret to outsiders. The air of mystery that surrounds you and your organization only serves to aid you in your cases, which can often be dangerous investigations into cultists and supernatural threats. However, you might have earned the suspicion or ire of others within the Order of the Palatine Eye due to your near-constant field work and the fact that initiates and lower-order members are kept in the dark about your provenance.

You are likely unclear as to the exact source of your abilities. Depending on your understanding of your Order's teachings, you could have gained this power from the knowledge you gained through The Lost Gospels of Tabris. This knowledge seems to hint at greater mysteries underlying existence and the cosmos, as well as mysteries hidden between the veils of morality that suffuse the planes, which could have unlocked your potential. It could also be that you gained your abilities due to your connection to the various artifacts and relics that the Order of the Palatine Eye has collected over its lifetime. The nature of many of these items remains unclear even after decades of study, but your proximity to these relics could have triggered an awakening of abilities. Your abilities might simply function because you believe they must. It would be disastrous for you to lose access to these abilities, so you believe them to function and considerations otherwise are something you refuse to acknowledge.

Regardless, you've learned to make use of your abilities to work against magical forces. These abilities allow you to tap into greater magical potential, create wards to protect yourself from magical attacks, and even grant you esoteric insight to better harm your foes. While these abilities are potent, you must also make sure to not let your Order training lapse. You make use of your mind, your canny insight, and deductive skills to deal with the various mysteries of existence that you encounter and the supernatural foes that you find along the way.

## [[Class Features/Palatine Detective|Palatine Detective]]1st

*   investigator

Whether at the invitation of a senior member of the Esoteric Order of the Palatine Eye, after going through a rigorous sorting process, or by a twist of fate, you recently underwent a secret ritual involving _The Lost Gospels of Tabris_ that granted you a greater understanding of both the divine and the occult. Not even you are certain of the origin or purpose of the forces that have granted you these abilities, but you know the key to answering that question and expanding your power lies hidden behind the cryptic words of the many ancient texts still waiting to be discovered and examined. If you choose this class archetype, you must select Palatine Detective Dedication as your 2nd-level class feat.

**Prerequisites:** You must be an investigator. You are affiliated with the Esoteric Order of the Palatine Eye.

**Palatine Detective Adjustments:** Instead of choosing a methodology from others available to the investigator class, you have the esoterica methodology (see below).

## Esoterica Methodology

You become trained in Occultism or Religion, and you gain the [[Feats/Quick Identification|Quick Identification]] skill feat. In addition, choose one common cantrip from the divine spell list and one common cantrip from the occult spell list. You can cast those spells as innate spells at will. You become trained in the spell attack modifier and spell DCs statistics. Intelligence is your spellcasting attribute.

**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** A creature you can see Casts a Spell that is from the divine or occult tradition.

Your deep grasp of the mystical lets you know exactly what to say to make others doubt how well they understand the source of their own power.

Attempt a counteract check against the triggering spell. Your counteract rank is half your level rounded up. You use your Occultism modifier as your counteract modifier if the triggering spell is from the occult tradition, or your Religion modifier if the triggering spell is from the divine tradition.

## [[Feats/Cursebreaker|Cursebreaker]] Feat 10

*   archetype
*   concentrate
*   healing
*   manipulate

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

Using various implements and esoteric methods, you can attempt to remove a curse from an unfortunate victim. It takes 10 minutes to perform these rites on a willing creature, who must remain within your reach the entire time.

Attempt to counteract one curse afflicting the creature; your counteract rank is half your level rounded up, and you use either your `Occultism check` or `Religion check` modifier as your counteract modifier. If the afflicted creature or the individual who placed the curse on the afflicted creature is the target of your active investigation through Pursue a Lead, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to this counteract check.

If the curse comes from a cursed item or other external source, a success indicates that the target creature can rid itself of the cursed item, but it doesn't remove the curse from the item.

In addition, when you attempt a Strike during this time against a creature about which you could Recall Knowledge using Occultism or Religion, the attack ignores circumstance penalties to the attack roll and any flat check required due to the target being [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] or [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]].
