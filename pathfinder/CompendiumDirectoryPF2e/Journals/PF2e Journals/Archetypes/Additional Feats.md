# Additional Feats
Some archetypes include a list of "Additional Feats" that appear in other sources. The list includes each feat's level, which might be different than normal when gained from the archetype. You can take the feat as an archetype feat of that level, meaning it counts toward the number of feats required by the archetype's dedication feat. When selected this way, a feat that normally has a class's trait (such as the fighter trait) doesn't have that class trait.
