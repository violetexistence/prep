# Lich
*   Rare

The path to lichdom is long and winding, with many pitfalls that overcome all but the most accomplished and precise spellcasters. Despite the trials you underwent and decades spent sequestered away with magical tomes, you know with every fiber of your being that it's all been worth it. You devised a unique and incredibly evil ritual to tear your soul from your body, and you painstakingly crafted a receptacle to house your freed soul. Immortality now lies within your grasp.

Becoming a lich requires much more than just magical knowledge. It demands fierce intelligence, bold ingenuity, incredible determination, unending patience, and a strict adherence to perfection, along with incredible skill as an artisan, for each lich must create their own soul cage. A mispronounced word or flaw in the construction of your soul cage would end not in immortality but ignominious death. You have all these skills in abundance and now, with your ascension, you've proven your superiority beyond a shadow of a doubt.

As a lich, you understand better than any the power and potential of magic. Many liches strive to increase their magical skills and foil the magic of any who dare oppose them. Others delve so deeply into necromantic arts and foul rituals that their flesh can burn the living, causing biological processes to falter and filling those who behold them with uncontrollable fear.

Regardless of what paths they pursue, nearly all liches are obsessed with their soul cage, spending untold hours and a veritable fortune to protect it, surrounding it with magical and mundane hazards, and guarding it with powerful, loyal defenders. Some liches prefer to secure their soul cage through obscurity rather than force, enshrouding it in magical abjurations or illusions to hide it from prying eyes. The most gifted crafters among liches tinker and improve their soul cage over time, rendering it nigh indestructible. This is a dangerous proposition, undertaken by only the most confident and arrogant magical engineers, as physically altering one's soul cage could have unintended consequences on its function. Many wizard liches instead learn to tap into the soul cage's magical energy from afar to fuel their own spellcasting.

## [[Feats/Drain Soul Cage|Drain Soul Cage]] Feat 14

*   archetype

You make your soul cage into your bonded item, allowing you to harness its abundant magical energy. Once per day, when you use [[Actions/Drain Bonded Item|Drain Bonded Item]], you can choose any spell in your spellbook that you can cast, even if you haven't prepared or cast it that day. Your soul cage doesn't need to be on your person for you to use Drain Bonded Item. If your soul cage is broken or destroyed, you can't use Drain Soul Cage. Even if you can Drain Bonded Item more than once per day, for instance if you are a universalist wizard, you can still only choose a spell you haven't prepared and cast once per day.

## [[Feats/Spell Gem|Spell Gem]] Feat 16

*   Uncommon
*   archetype

Inspired by the degenerate demiliches your kind sometimes devolves into, you've embedded a gem into your brow, fusing it to your necrotic flesh. This gem has been specially calibrated to hold one of the following spells: [[Spells/Repulsion|Repulsion]], [[Spells/Scrying|Scrying]], or [[Spells/Truesight|Truesight]]. You must decide which spell your gem contains when you take this feat; changing the spell requires retraining the feat. Once per day, you can drain the gem's magical energy to Cast the Spell without spending a spell slot.

At 18th level, you can heighten whichever spell you chose to 7th level. At 20th level, you can heighten whichever spell you chose to 8th level; regardless of which spell you chose, you can instead drain the gem's magical energy to cast an 8th-rank spell turning without spending a spell slot.

## [[Feats/Frightful Aura|Frightful Aura]] Feat 18

You're surrounded by a palpable sense of menace and power that's terrifying to behold. The aura is a 15-foot emanation. An enemy that enters or ends its turn in the aura must attempt a `Will check` save against the higher of your spell DC or class DC.

**Success** The creature is unaffected and temporarily immune to your Frightful Aura for 1 minute.

**Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]].

**Critical Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]].
