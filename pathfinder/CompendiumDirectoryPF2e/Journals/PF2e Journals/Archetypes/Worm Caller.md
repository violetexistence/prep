You follow the ancient hryngar tradition of the worm callerâ€”mystics who can call upon the strength and destructive force of the mighty cave worms that inhabit the Darklands. You can manifest worms to attack your enemies, draw upon their senses and resistances, summon one to do your bidding and, eventually, become a worm yourself
