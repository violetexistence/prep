# Cultivator
*   Rare

Cultivators are seekers of immortality who practice occult disciplines to refine their qi. By gathering and purifying vast quantities of qi and enriching their bodies' qi with energies from the Universe and Creation's Forge, these warriors pursue—or "cultivate"—immortality and gain mastery over life and death. Many cultivators seek to become ageless immortals with awe-inspiring mystical powers known as xian and potentially even ascend to divinity as minor officials of the Tian pantheon. More unorthodox cultivators instead mingle qi with the Void and the Netherworld's dark energies.

While humanoid cultivators are the norm, it isn't unheard of for animals, trees, rocks, or even household objects to cultivate their qi and become powerful yaoguai. The mountains of Shanguang, Shenmen, and Zi Ha are famed sites for cultivators, as are the bamboo groves of Songbai and the verdant heart of the Valashmai Jungle. All types of cultivators are watched over carefully by Tian Xia's imperial dragons, for cultivators go against Heaven's will in seeking to transcend their ontology and destiny. There is little place for the timid among cultivators, as they seek to stand among the most powerful beings of both earth and Heaven. As a result, their personalities tend to be extreme, possessed of otherworldly benevolence, hellish wrath, or unmoving poise.

The intense effort and discipline required to reach the peaks of cultivation weed out most aspirants before they can even truly begin, and the tribulations that most cultivators attract winnows the rest. While calamity drives many to cultivate, rumors persist that gods and dragons alike test and punish cultivation's path with yet more hardship and woe. For every cultivator who eventually attains immortality, a thousand more aspirants meet their ends in the cruelest fates.

Cultivators are rare, even within Tian Xia.

## [[Feats/Cultivator Dedication|Cultivator Dedication]] Feat 2

*   Rare
*   archetype
*   dedication

**Prerequisites** trained in Occultism

* * *

Through an esoteric, often exacting, regimen of meditation, diet, and exercise, you've learned to transform your body's inner workings into a crucible of planar and spiritual energies. These austerities allow you to refine your body's vitality into qi, the foundation of all cultivation.

You become an expert in Occultism. In addition, you gain the [[Spells/Adapt Self|Adapt Self]] domain spell as a focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity meditating to refine essence into qi, which circulates and refills your focus pool. Your cultivator focus spells are occult spells. You're trained in spell attack modifier and spell DC. Your key spellcasting attribute for these spells is Wisdom.

Cultivator focus spells are treated as qi spells for prerequisites, counting the number of qi spells you possess and their effects, such as a jiang-shi's Drain Qi.

## [[Feats/Immortal Lightness|Immortal Lightness]] Feat 4

*   archetype

You breathe, allowing your golden core to release qi into the meridians governing your lower body, and break into a burst of speed that could shame arrows in flight. You gain the [[Spells/Athletic Rush|Athletic Rush]] domain spell as a focus spell.

## [[Feats/Lotus Above the Wind|Lotus Above the Wind]] Feat 6

*   archetype

Your qi, dancing ever diligently toward cultivation, eludes the grasp of the world's muck and mire. When you cast your [[Spells/Adapt Self|Adapt Self]] or [[Spells/Athletic Rush|Athletic Rush]] focus spells, you ignore difficult terrain until the end of your next turn.

## [[Feats/Three Clear Breaths|Three Clear Breaths]] Feat 6

*   archetype

Through your disciplined condensations and circulations of qi, you've caught a fleeting glimpse of cultivation's promise, and your health has handsomely profited along the way. You gain the [[Feats/Breath Control|Breath Control]], [[Feats/Diehard|Diehard]], and [[Feats/Fast Recovery|Fast Recovery]] feats. You must meet the prerequisites for these feats as normal. For each of these feats you already have, you can instead gain a different feat from the following list: [[Feats/Canny Acumen|Canny Acumen]], [[Feats/Fleet|Fleet]], and [[Feats/Toughness|Toughness]].

*   vitality

**Frequency** once per hour

## [[Feats/Cultivator's Keen Eye|Cultivator's Keen Eye]] Feat 8

*   archetype
*   occult

Attuned to all arrangements of qi, you gain lifesense as an imprecise sense with a range of 30 feet. You can also sense the presence of precious materials in the same range, which cultivators refer to as "cultivation materials."

When you participate in rituals, you can substitute all or part of the ritual's cost with an equivalent value of precious materials. This applies only to costs in valuable substances like diamonds, not to rituals that require specific items to function; the GM makes the call if it's unclear.

## [[Feats/Ghost-Path Epiphany|Ghost-Path Epiphany]] Feat 10

*   archetype

Deviating from the orthodox path, you tread an inauspicious descent littered with flowers of death; this heretical choice will, in time, earn you the enmity and fear of more traditional cultivators. You become sanctified with the unholy trait. You also learn the [[Spells/Call Spirit|Call Spirit]] and [[Spells/Commune|Commune]] rituals, which can be used to contact only undead or entities from the Void or the Netherworld.

When you cast a ritual, you can reduce the number of secondary casters by 1 as you direct decaying fragments of your own soul, felled by your proximity to death, to assist with the ritual. When you do, you must fulfill any requirements for the secondary caster, and you attempt the secondary check normally performed by that secondary caster. You can't replace a secondary caster who's the target of the spell (as in the atone ritual).

## [[Feats/Three Pecks of Dew|Three Pecks of Dew]] Feat 10

*   archetype

At this stage of cultivation, your body is as much spirit as flesh. While still fettered to the physical realm, your form flourishes without needing conventional food or drink, and your natural healing now rivals that brought by scalpel and suture.

You become sanctified with the holy trait. When you perform the Subsist downtime activity, you can use Occultism for the skill check (instead of the skills normally associated with your environment). If you do so, this activity gains the vitality trait as you subsist on ambient qi within your environment's dew-laden air and create shelter from solidified emanations of qi.

Additionally, when you Refocus, you can also [[Actions/Treat Wounds|Treat Wounds]] at the same time. If you do so, you can use Occultism for checks to Treat Wounds and disregard the need for a [[Equipment/Healer's Toolkit|Healer's Toolkit]]; this activity gains the vitality trait as you circulate healing qi through your own body or transfuse your ally with healing qi.

## [[Feats/The Bitter Scholar's Promotion|The Bitter Scholar's Promotion]] Feat 16

*   archetype

Tian Xia's shining cities belie its empires' long shadow of death, darkened by thousands of years of suffering and injustice. You pursue immortality not through tuft-hunting with Heaven's dragons or their imperial brats; yours is the power to crack its corrupt wheel, for you can now release the ghost gates to expedite the dead's revenge at being cheated of their fates.

You cease aging and, regardless of your actual existential state, now register as an undead to effects that can detect undead (such as lifesense or spiritsense).

In addition, you learn [[Spells/Create Undead|Create Undead]] rituals for [[Book of the Dead/Gashadokuro|Gashadokuro]], [[Book of the Dead/Provincial Jiang-shi|Jiang-shi]], and [[Lost Omens Bestiary/Shui Gui|Shui Gui]]. On a success with one of these rituals, you gain the effects of a critical success instead.

## [[Feats/The Immortal Attains the Summit|The Immortal Attains the Summit]] Feat 16

*   archetype

Your cultivation bearing glorious fruit, you behold Heaven's will. Returning from your vision of the Holy Mountain, you become an immortal with mystic potency over the terrestrial realms of wind and water.

You cease aging and, regardless of your actual existential state, now register as a living being to effects that can detect living creatures (such as lifesense or spiritsense).

In addition, you learn the [[Spells/Control Weather|Control Weather]] and [[Spells/Plant Growth|Plant Growth]] rituals. You can use Occultism instead of Nature for these rituals. On a success with one of these rituals, you gain the effects of a critical success instead.
