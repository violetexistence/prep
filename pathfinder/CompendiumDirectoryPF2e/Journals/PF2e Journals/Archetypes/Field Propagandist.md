# Field Propagandist
*   Uncommon

Some might call you a journalist, while others might think of you as a town crier or deploy you as a herald. You know that you are so much more: the words you use and the stories you tell can sway the course of battles or turn the tides of war. You have studied the means to influence the beliefs and behaviors of those around you. You boost the morale of your allies, confound enemies, and influence neutral bystanders.

Whether you work as a journalist for a private organization, such as the Pathfinder Society, or are directly employed by a government body to reveal the best face of their actions, you've accepted a role that requires you to do more than just report events. You excel at inserting your own interpretation into the narrative and using that interpretation to sway the hearts and minds of your audience, for good or ill. Those whom you might speak against may not appreciate your words, referring to them as "lies" or "slander," but you have come to understand that truth can be as changeable as the winds.

## [[Feats/Predispose Settlement|Predispose Settlement]] Feat 4

*   archetype
*   downtime
*   skill

You spend 7 days of downtime seeding propaganda through a settlement with a population of 2,500 or fewer. At 10th level, this increases to a settlement with a population of 10,000 or fewer, and at 16th level, you can affect settlements of any size.

Select a faction or organization (such as the Pathfinder Society, the Hellknights, or the Firebrands) that this propaganda targets and whether you are improving or decreasing the settlement's attitude toward that faction. After this period, attempt a `Deception check` or `Diplomacy check` check against the hard DC of the level of the settlement. These changes last for 1 week before the people return to their original attitudes.

* * *

**Critical Success** You adjust the starting attitude of the settlement's inhabitants toward the targeted faction by two steps. In addition, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus on initiative rolls made in encounters that include members of your targeted faction while in the settlement for 1 week.

**Success** As critical success, but the inhabitants' attitude is adjusted by one step.

**Critical Failure** The propaganda attempt backfires. The attitude of the settlement's inhabitants toward you decreases by one step.

## [[Feats/Invincible Army|Invincible Army]] Feat 6

*   archetype
*   auditory
*   concentrate
*   linguistic
*   mental

**Frequency** once per round

* * *

You enumerate the many virtues and victories of your chosen allies, creating a story of their invincibility so convincing that it is as good as the truth. Choose an ally you can see and attempt a `Deception check` or `Diplomacy check` check against the hard DC for the target's level. On a success, the target gains resistance 5 to either bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, chosen when you use this ability; the type of damage resisted is usually tied to the story you tell about the character, such as giving them piercing resistance after telling a story about the time they rushed through a rain of arrows to take on an enemy encampment.

You can instead attempt your check against a very hard DC for the target's level to give them resistance to two damage types, adding acid, fire, cold, electricity, and sonic to the damage types you can grant resistance to.

## [[Feats/A Tale To Believe In|A Tale To Believe In]] Feat 8

*   archetype
*   auditory
*   concentrate
*   linguistic

## [[Feats/Orator's Filibuster|Orator's Filibuster]] Feat 8

*   archetype
*   auditory
*   concentrate
*   linguistic
*   mental

When you seek to convince others of the worth of your cause, you are capable of unleashing such an entrancing torrent of rhetoric and metaphor that it is all but impossible to look away from you. When you begin a conversation or similar attempt with the goal of Making an Impression, all creatures who are observing you become [[Conditions/Fascinated|Fascinated]] unless they succeed at a `Will check` save against the higher of your class DC or spell DC. Creatures who are familiar with you and your verbal techniques, such as allies you've known for at least several days, are immune to this effect, though newer allies who have not heard one of your speeches before might still be affected.

Affected creatures remain fascinated for as long as you continue your filibuster, though they can attempt a new save to end the effect at the end of each minute while your filibuster lasts. A creature who succeeds at a saving throw to end the fascinated condition from your filibuster is also unaffected by your attempt to [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]].

You can continue your filibuster indefinitely, but after every 10 minutes you must attempt a `Fortitude check` Fortitude saving throw against a hard DC for your level. Failing this save results in your filibuster ending and prevents you from attempting another filibuster for 1 hour.

## [[Feats/The Truth As I See It|The Truth As I See It]] Feat 10

*   archetype

Your knack for spinning a believable reality from threads of story is so practiced that sometimes even you begin to believe what you're saying. When you use Deception to Lie, you can carefully structure your deceits so that each individual statement you make is the truth, from a certain perspective. Once per day when using Deception to Lie, you can roll twice and take the better result. This is a fortune effect.

You don't take a penalty to Deception checks while subject to the ring of truth spell or similar effects. Whenever you are subject to ring of truth or a similar effect, you can attempt a Deception check when you first begin speaking to counteract the spell's effects, with a counteract rank equal to half your level (rounded up); succeeding at this check doesn't end the spell or effect, but it does cause it to indicate that you are speaking the truth, even when you are actually lying.

## [[Feats/Mass Delusion|Mass Delusion]] Feat 12

*   archetype

You wave around fabricated evidence that contradicts what your enemies know to be true. When you Fabricate Truth, you can affect all enemies within 30 feet of you. Compare your Deception check result to the Will DCs of all targets. It is possible to get a different degree of success for each target.
