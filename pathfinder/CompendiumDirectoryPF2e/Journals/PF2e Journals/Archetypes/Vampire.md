# Vampire
*   Rare

After being exsanguinated by a vampire, you've risen again, pulling yourself from the earth as an immortal undead. You're a creature of the night, harmed by the light of day and thirsting for blood.

  

| Vampire Vulnerabilities |
| --- |
| Your power comes with a price. As a vampire, you have the following vulnerabilities.<br/>**Revulsion:** You can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of brandished garlic or a religious symbol of a non-evil deity. A creature must Interact to brandish garlic or a religious symbol for 1 round (similar to Raising a Shield). If you involuntarily come within 10 feet of an object of your revulsion, you gain the [[Conditions/Fleeing\|Fleeing]] condition, running from the subject of your revulsion until you end an action beyond 10 feet of it. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of your revulsion, you can attempt a `DC 25 Will check` save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, you overcome your revulsions for 1d6 rounds, or 1 hour on a critical success.<br/>**Sunlight:** If exposed to direct sunlight, you immediately become [[Conditions/Slowed\|Slowed 1]]. The slowed value increases by 1 each time you end your turn in sunlight. If you lose all your actions in this way, you are destroyed. Due to your supernatural aversion to light, you don't cast shadows or show a reflection in mirrors. |

## [[Feats/Coffin Bound|Coffin Bound]] Feat 12

*   Uncommon
*   archetype
*   divine
*   void

You bind your spirit to a coffin filled with soil of your homeland, making it a place of recovery. If you rest inside your coffin for 10 minutes, you regain Hit Points equal to your Constitution modifier x half your level. You can still be healed in other ways during that time, though you're [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]] and therefore unable to heal yourself. The GM might allow you to Refocus while resting, depending on whether it's a type of Refocusing you can achieve while you slumber.

If you would be destroyed, you instead remain near death. This doesn't change your dying or wounded value, and you remain unconscious. After 1 hour, you're destroyed. If returned to your coffin before that hour is up, you avoid destruction; if you spend 1 hour resting in your coffin, you regain 1 HP and lose the dying and wounded conditions. You can't be healed in any other way when near death.

Your coffin can't heal you if you're staked through the chest. You can be staked only if unconscious, and it takes three actions. You lose all benefits of this feat if your coffin is destroyed or the soil is lost. You must procure a new coffin and fill it with soil of your homeland to restore the feat's function.

You take move actions to move directly toward your coffin even though you are at 0 HP, though you aren't conscious and don't have control over how you do so. While at 0 HP in this form, you are unaffected by further damage. You automatically return to your corporeal form, [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]], if you reach your coffin or after 1 hour when you are destroyed, whichever one comes first.

If you are destroyed, all your dominate spells from Dominating Gaze immediately end.
