# Ostilli Host
*   Uncommon

Ostillis are amorphous organisms that combine characteristics of both plants and animals. Typically found in subterranean environments, they can share a symbiotic arrangement with surkis. When a magic-gathering node on a surki's body is damaged or absent, an ostilli is placed on it like a bandage, and after several weeks, the creature fully fuses with its host and becomes a makeshift node, accumulating the magical nourishment that the surki needs to survive. With training, surkis—and increasingly, members of other species—can direct these tiny symbiotes to a variety of magical feats.

## [[Feats/Ostilli Host Dedication|Ostilli Host Dedication]] Feat 2

*   Uncommon
*   archetype
*   dedication

**Prerequisites** trained in Arcana or Nature

**Access** surki ancestry

* * *

You've bonded with an attached symbiote known as an ostilli. You can bond with only one ostilli at a time since the symbiote emits low-frequency magical pulses that repel other ostillis. You become trained in Ostilli Lore; if you were already trained, you become an expert.

The ostilli is a Tiny creature grafted to your body. Like other grafts, it has no Hit Points or Speeds of its own and can't be targeted separately. It can't be removed and dies when you do; in the event of your demise and resurrection, you can bond to a new ostilli during a week of downtime, though you lose any abilities granted by your ostilli bond during that time. Your ostilli is obvious, unless you attempt to cover it with clothing or armor. In such a case, an onlooker can determine you're bonded to an ostilli with a successful Nature, Perception, or Surki Lore check against your Deception DC. Your ostilli must be visible for you to use any of the actions it grants.

Your ostilli is constantly siphoning ambient magic from the surroundings, granting you the [[Actions/Repel Ambient Magic|Repel Ambient Magic]] and [[Actions/Spit Ambient Magic|Spit Ambient Magic]] actions.

## [[Feats/Versatile Mutation|Versatile Mutation]] Feat 4

*   archetype

Your ostilli's darts can deal different types of damage. When you Spit Ambient Magic, you can choose to have the ostilli deal bludgeoning or slashing damage instead of piercing damage. At 8th level, choose one of the following: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage; when your ostilli Spits Ambient Magic, it can deal that damage type instead and adds that trait to the action.

* * *

**Special** You can take this feat a second time at 16th level. When you do, choose two additional energy types from those available through this feat at 8th level; you can choose to have your ostilli deal that damage type when it Spits Ambient Magic.

## [[Feats/Chaining Mutation|Chaining Mutation]] Feat 8

## [[Feats/Deadly Mutation|Deadly Mutation]] Feat 8

*   archetype

The dart fired by your ostilli is more dangerous. The damage dice of your Spit Ambient Magic increase to d8s, and when a target critically fails its save against the ability, it also takes 1d6 persistent bleed damage. If you dealt a type of energy damage with Spit Ambient Magic (such as when dealing fire damage with Versatile Mutation), the persistent damage is damage of that type instead of bleed.

The first time you regain Hit Points at the start of your turn, you reduce your wounded condition by 1.
