# Stonebound
*   Uncommon

A stonebound is a devoted sentinel who draws on the power of the earth and stone to protect their people.

While stonebound are most commonly found in dwarven enclaves, the practice of binding oneself to the nature of stone is found in the mountains of Garund, Vudra, Arcadia, and in various Darklands communities. A person who binds themselves to stone becomes more resilient to damage, capable of surviving for longer than their unbound counterparts, and often gains a deeper understanding of stone beyond mere knowledge.

Historians theorize that this technique originated in Orv and spread from there. The practice of binding to stone is most common where elemental power, especially the essence of earth, is the strongest. This practice has begun to spread to Belkzen, throughout the Darklands, and across the deserts of northern Garund. Most recently, the Martial Mineral Masters in Quain have adopted the technique for their new dojo and flour mill. The most famous stonebound public figure is Sorrina Westyr, Spellmaster for the Pathfinder Society, who spent a decade in the Elemental Plane of Earth.
