# Talisman Dabbler
The classic idea of magic is that of a hoary wizard, poring over a crumbling book of spells as years pass. But magic is so much more than thatâ€”it's thought, will, and action, and with the right talismans, you can make even the cut of a sword a deeply magical act. This all hinges on the small magical talismans you affix to your gear. You know how to make and use the perfect talisman for any job. The utility of talismans seems endless. They can help swords to swing harder, shields to block better, grant a burst of speed in a desperate situation, and even save one from a lethal fall. This all excites you, but no more than exploring just how far you can push your talent. What are the true limits of these baubles? You've heard rumors and tales of great dabblers like yourself mastering the art of creating and affixing fantastical magical memorabilia. Some say that these great sages have found a way to affix multiple talismans to a single object, circumventing the most fundamental limitation of the art. Whether you were formally trained or picked up the skill as a hobby, your talent is undeniable, and the usefulness of talismans is apparent. Take advantage of every ounce of magic you can manipulate and master these mystical trinkets.

*   archetype
*   dedication

**Prerequisites**

* * *

You are trained in the use of talismans and similar magical paraphernalia. This training might have occurred in a formal classroom or been an accumulation of folk magic picked up over time. You can craft talismans and know the formulas for all common talismans of your level or lower. You remember talisman formulas and don't need a formula book for them.

Additionally, you carry a vast collection of magical baubles you can turn into temporary talismans. Each day during your daily preparations, you can make two talismans with an item level no higher than half your level. You must know each talisman's formula. A talisman created this way is a temporary item and loses its magic the next time you make your daily preparations if you haven't already used it. Any saving throw DC required by a temporary talisman you create uses the highest of your class DC, spell DC, or the talisman's DC.

Finally, when you Affix a Talisman, you can (in any combination) affix or remove up to four talismans in the 10-minute span.

You gain the ability to [[Actions/Affix a Talisman|Affix a Talisman]] as a 3-action activity from that feat at 12th level, regardless of your Crafting proficiency.

## [[Feats/Talismanic Sage|Talismanic Sage]] Feat 14

*   archetype

Normally, affixing more than one talisman to an item causes the talismans to be suppressed, but when you Affix a Talisman, you can specially treat one item you're working on, allowing it to have two active talismans at once. This special treatment ends if you use [[Actions/Affix a Talisman|Affix a Talisman]] to treat a new item for this ability.
