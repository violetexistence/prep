# Prophet of Kalistrade
*   uncommon

You've dedicated your life to the teachings of Kalistrade, a mystic whose writings promise success through a restrictive set of practices. When you joined the Prophets of Kalistrade, you agreed to abide by the edicts of its eponymous founder. You follow a diet that prizes certain virtuous foods and avoids impure sustenance. You frequently meditate to keep yourself sharp. You value finding clever loopholes and making good deals as long as you don't ruin another's fortune entirely.

Dedicating yourself to Kalistocratic ways opened many doors when it comes to business connections and entrepreneurial knowledge. Like any good Kalistocrat, you turn one advantage into a stepping stone toward the next. Between your connections, your social skills, and (of course) your wealth, it's hard to get one over on you.

**Additional Feats:** 4th Gossip Lore
