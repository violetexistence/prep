# Acrobat
You have trained your body to perform incredible, seemingly superhuman feats of grace and agility. You move in ways that leave your opponents fumbling for a response, turning every fight into a nimble piece of performance art.

Often underestimated, such mastery over the body is useful both on a stage and a battlefield. In fact, acrobatics is an often-practiced art among thieves, assassins, and explorers.

## [[Feats/Acrobat Dedication|Acrobat Dedication]] Feat 2

*   archetype
*   dedication

**Prerequisites** trained in Acrobatics

* * *

You become an expert in Acrobatics. At 7th level, you become a master in Acrobatics, and at 15th level, you become legendary in Acrobatics. Whenever you critically succeed at an Acrobatics check to [[Actions/Tumble Through|Tumble Through]] an enemy's space, you don't treat the enemy's space as difficult terrain.

## [[Feats/Contortionist|Contortionist]] Feat 4

*   archetype

You can squeeze out of tight situations surprisingly quickly, gaining an advantage against foes that try to pin you down. You gain the [[Feats/Quick Squeeze|Quick Squeeze]] skill feat, and if you're a master in Acrobatics, you can [[Actions/Squeeze|Squeeze]] at full Speed.

Whenever you successfully [[Actions/Escape|Escape]] using Acrobatics, the creature you Escaped from is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] against the next attack you make against it before the end of your next turn.

## [[Feats/Dodge Away|Dodge Away]] Feat 6

*   archetype

**Trigger** You are the target of a melee attack.

**Requirements** You're aware of the attack and aren't [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]].

* * *

You use your acrobatic prowess to evade an attack, using momentum to keep yourself moving, if you choose.

You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC against the triggering attack. If the attack misses you, you can [[Actions/Step|Step]] after the Strike.

If you're a master in Acrobatics, you can move 10 feet on this Step instead of 5 feet.

## [[Feats/Graceful Leaper|Graceful Leaper]] Feat 7

*   archetype
*   skill

Mass and muscle are meaningless when you propel yourself through the air; only grace and balance matter.

You can roll an Acrobatics check instead of an Athletics check when making a [[Actions/high-jump skill=acrobatics|high-jump skill=acrobatics]] or [[Actions/long-jump skill=acrobatics|long-jump skill=acrobatics]].

## [[Feats/Show-Off|Show-Off]] Feat 8

*   Uncommon
*   archetype
*   flourish

**Frequency** once per minute

**Trigger** You succeed at an Acrobatics or Athletics check deemed suitably challenging and meaningful by the GM.

* * *

As is the tradition with many Firebrands, you call your shot and look to impress with an extra bit of panache or a greater stunt. Attempt the triggering check again, using the second result. On a success, you gain the normal results of the check, plus you feel invigorated by your stunt and gain temporary Hit Points equal to your level (double your level on a critical success). You lose any remaining temporary Hit Points after 1 minute. Typically, a challenging task is one with at least a standard DC for your level, though the difficulty may be higher depending on the situation. A meaningful context is one where the action's success or failure is relevant to the pursuit of your goals.

## [[Feats/Tumbling Strike|Tumbling Strike]] Feat 8

*   archetype
*   flourish
*   move

**Requirements** You are adjacent to an enemy.

* * *

You deftly dive through a gap left by a foe to deliver an advantageous blow. Attempt an Acrobatics check against the Reflex DC of an enemy adjacent to you.

**Critical Success** You move through the enemy's space to an unoccupied space on the other side of the enemy from your starting position. This movement doesn't trigger reactions. You can't move farther than your Speed, and you must end your movement adjacent to the enemy whose space you moved through. After moving, you make a melee Strike against the enemy whose space you moved through, and the enemy is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] against that Strike.

**Success** As critical success, but the enemy isn't off-guard against the Strike.

**Failure** You remain in your original space but can still Strike.

**Critical Failure** You neither move nor Strike.

## [[Feats/Mockingbird's Disarm|Mockingbird's Disarm]] Feat 10

*   Uncommon
*   archetype

**Frequency** once per minute

**Trigger** You succeed at a check to [[Actions/Tumble Through|Tumble Through]] or use [[Feats/Tumbling Strike|Tumbling Strike]], and you moved through an enemy's space.

* * *

The Mockingbird is a master at running into foes and coming away with their weapons. Mimicking their skill, you strike at a foe's wrist while tumbling past them, weakening their grip. You attempt to [[Actions/Disarm|Disarm]] the enemy whose space you moved through. You can use Acrobatics instead of Athletics for this check.

*   attack

**Frequency** once per minute

**Requirements** Your most recent action was to [[Actions/Tumble Through|Tumble Through]] or [[Feats/Tumbling Strike|Tumbling Strike]], and you successfully moved through an enemy's space.

* * *

You use a burst of stamina to perform a breathtaking feat of Acrobatics as you speed through a foe's space, leaving your foe lying flat on their back. You attempt to [[Actions/Trip|Trip]] the enemy whose space you moved through. You can use [[Actions/trip skill=acrobatics|trip skill=acrobatics]]{Acrobatics} instead of Athletics for this check.

## [[Feats/Virtuosic Dancer|Virtuosic Dancer]] Feat 12

*   Uncommon
*   archetype

You're so fond of using your Acrobatic feats on the stage that you've begun adding your own flair to these dances on the big stage. When you [[Actions/Perform|Perform]], if you do a performance that is either related to dance, acting or opera, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the roll. If you're legendary in Acrobatics, this increases to a +2 circumstance bonus. You gain the [[Actions/Dancing Dodge|Dancing Dodge]] reaction.

## [[Feats/Quick Spring|Quick Spring]] Feat 13

*   Uncommon
*   archetype
*   skill

Ishii Bunji is a skilled tumbler, and learning his technique allows you to push yourself off a foe and propel yourself across the battlefield faster. If you succeed at an Acrobatics check to [[Actions/Tumble Through|Tumble Through]] an enemy's space, you can Stride again as a free action after you complete your current movement.
