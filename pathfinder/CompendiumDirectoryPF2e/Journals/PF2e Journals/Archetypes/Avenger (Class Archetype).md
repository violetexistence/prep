# Avenger (Class Archetype)
Most people are aware of champions and clerics as the most obvious of a deity's divinely empowered servants, and those familiar with vindicators as the more subtle arm of the church's might have generally grown to accept their necessity. There exists, however, other corners of religious power that churches may be less open about with their lay worshippers. Avengers are one such example.

Sometimes known as slayers among more brutal doctrines, avengers are trained in remote monasteries or secret cloisters hidden from the eyes of casual passersby. They are indoctrinated in their church's teachings while being taught a variety of martial skills, many focused around mastery of their deity's favored weapon. These training environments often also enforce vows of silence, vows of celibacy, or other practices intended to keep the avengers-in-training from forming strong personal attachments.

## [[Class Features/Avenger|Avenger]] 1st

*   rogue

Trained far from watching eyes, you use stealth, intimidation, and deadly bladework to root out threats to your church. You must select [[Feats/Avenger Dedication|Avenger Dedication]] as your 2nd-level class feat.

**Prerequisites:** You must be a rogue.

**Avenger Adjustments:** You must choose a deity to be a follower of.

You are trained in Intimidation, Religion, Stealth, the divine skill granted by your racket, and a number of additional skills equal to 3 plus your Intelligence modifier, instead of your normal starting skill proficiencies.

You must choose the avenger racket for your rogue's racket.

You do not gain the [[Class Features/Surprise Attack|Surprise Attack]] class feature. You gain the [[Actions/Hunt Prey|Hunt Prey]] action.

## Avenger Racket

Trained to be a precise but brutal weapon by the priests of your faith, you eschew complex trickery for swift and deadly efficiency. Subtlety and deception have their uses, but when a false smile fails, your blades have their own way of finding the truth.

You are trained in your deity's favored weapon. Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency with simple or martial weapons, you also gain that proficiency rank with your deity's favored weapon.

You can deal sneak attack damage to your prey with your deity's favored weapon, in addition to the weapons listed in the sneak attack class feature. When you critically succeed at an attack roll using your deity's favored weapon and the target has the [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] condition, you also apply the weapon's critical specialization effect.

You're trained in your deity's divine skill and medium armor; if you're already trained in your deity's divine skill, you are instead trained in another skill of your choice. You can choose Strength as your key attribute modifier. When you gain light armor expertise, you also gain expert proficiency in medium armor, and when you gain light armor mastery, you also gain master proficiency in medium armor.

## [[Feats/Zealous Inevitability|Zealous Inevitability]] Feat 6

*   archetype
*   flourish

**Requirements** You are wielding your deity's favored weapon

* * *

You channel your zeal through a sacred weapon, bringing a foe closer to their demise. Strike a target with the required weapon. on a success, the target becomes [[Conditions/Doomed|Doomed 1]] or increases the value of their doomed condition by 1 (most living creatures die when they've reached doomed 4). Creatures doomed in this way take a status penalty to their saving throws against divine spells equal to their doomed value.

[[Feat_Feature Effects/Effect_ Zealous Inevitability|Effect: Zealous Inevitability]]

A creature that would become doomed 4 by this Strike can attempt a `Will check` saving throw against your class DC to avoid increasing the value of their doomed condition. When this occurs, this ability gains the incapacitation trait.

Your training included instruction on how to prevent enemy priests from using their magic against you, a technique you have mastered and adapted. Make a Strike with your deity's favored weapon against the triggering creature. On a success, the target is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the end of your next turn. The triggering spell is disrupted on a critical success, or on a success if the target is your hunted prey and the spell is a divine spell.

## [[Feats/Shadow of Death|Shadow of Death]] Feat 10

*   archetype

Strikes you make with your deity's favored weapon against a creature with the [[Conditions/Doomed|Doomed]] condition have the death trait, causing the target to be instantly killed when reduced to 0 Hit Points.

# Additional Feats

These feats are primarily intended for avengers but are also available to other rogues and members of certain other classes where appropriate. Once you select one of these feats, it loses the traits from the other classes.

## [[Feats/Haft Striker Stance|Haft Striker Stance]] Feat 4

*   fighter
*   ranger
*   rogue
*   stance

**Requirements** You are wielding a two-handed hammer, spear, or polearm.

* * *

You enter a stance that allows you to leverage the haft of your weapon to brutal effect as an effective and frighteningly efficient weapon in its own right. You treat the haft of your wielded weapon as a simple weapon dealing 1d4 bludgeoning damage. The haft is in the club group and has the agile and finesse traits. The haft shares any fundamental runes attached to the main weapon, so long as it would normally qualify for them.

While in Haft Striker Stance, you can use feats and abilities that normally require you to be wielding two melee weapons each in a different hand, treating the haft as the second weapon, but you can't use abilities that require you to be wielding a two-handed weapon.

## [[Feats/Haft Beatdown|Haft Beatdown]] Feat 10

*   fighter
*   ranger
*   rogue

**Frequency** once per minute

**Requirements** You are in Haft Striker Stance.

* * *

The momentum of each of your attacks feeds into the next blow in the routine, creating a brutal rhythm that enables you to give your target one continuous beatdown. Strike twice, once with your weapon and once with its haft. Each attack counts towards your multiple attack penalty, but do not increase your penalty until you have made both attacks. Then Strike twice again, once with your weapon and once with its haft.
