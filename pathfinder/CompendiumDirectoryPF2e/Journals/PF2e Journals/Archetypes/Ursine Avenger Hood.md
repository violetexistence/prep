# Ursine Avenger Hood
Some items inherit their magic not through an intentional spell or ritual but through generations of use and belief, slowly accumulating power and intent from those around them. The Ursine Avenger Hood is such an item. After defeating a powerful cave bear, the Ulfen hunter Baruk shaped the bear's head and fur into a helm and cape for himself. Baruk later fell in battle against a linnorm, successfully slaying the beast before succumbing to its death curse. His helm, soaked in the blood of man and linnorm and saturated with the magic of the linnorm's curse, was claimed by Baruk's daughter, who often told stories about the helm giving her a bear's strength and ferocity, though it was unclear at the time whether this was a boast.

Over many generations, the magic of the hood was proven true, and more than that, the magic continued to grow and evolve with ever-more-ursine attributes. As the belief and power of each new wearer soaked into the hood, the artifact's potential has continued to grow. Now, those who bond with the generational artifact will discover that the Ursine Avenger Hood continues to grow in power alongside them.

## [[Equipment/Ursine Avenger Hood|Ursine Avenger Hood]] Item 2

*   Unique
*   artifact
*   invested
*   primal

A gift passed from warrior to warrior, this cowl is made from a cave bear's skull and fur. Once invested, the wearer gains a +1 item bonus to Nature checks to [[Actions/Command an Animal|Command an Animal]], which increases to +2 if the animal is a bear. The wearer of the hood feels a constant longing for the wilderness and wild places and takes a â€“1 item penalty to all Diplomacy checks to Gather Information or [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] if they go more than 5 days inside a large town or city without spending at least 4 hours in the wilderness.

**Destruction** Soak the Ursine Avenger Hood in the blood of a linnorm that is at least 16th level and then burn it in a fire that uses only oak and chrysanthemum as fuel.

## [[Feats/Ursine Avenger Form|Ursine Avenger Form]] Feat 2

*   archetype
*   morph
*   primal

You draw the _Ursine Avenger Hood_ over your head and its fur over your arms, assuming an ursine form that has traits of your original form as well as that of a bear. In your ursine form, you gain a jaws unarmed attack that deals 1d8 piercing damage and a claws unarmed attack that deals 1d6 slashing damage and has the agile trait. Both unarmed attacks are in the brawling group. You lose the ability to speak complex sentences while transformed and can only communicate through grunts and gestures; this prevents you from using effects that require a shared or spoken language until you revert back to your non-hybrid form. You can use this action while transformed to remove the hood and return to your original form.
