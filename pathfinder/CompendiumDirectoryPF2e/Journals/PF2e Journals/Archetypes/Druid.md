# Druid
You have entered a druidic circle and learned a few of the order's secrets, granting you primal power.

## [[Feats/Druid Dedication|Druid Dedication]] Feat 2

*   archetype
*   dedication
*   multiclass

**Prerequisites** Wisdom +2

* * *

You cast spells like a druid. You gain the Cast a Spell activity. You can prepare two common cantrips each day from the primal spell list or any other primal cantrips you learn or discover. You're trained in the spell attack modifier and spell DC statistics. Your key spellcasting attribute for druid archetype spells is Wisdom, and they are primal druid spells. You learn the Wildsong language, and you are bound by the druid's anathema. Choose a druidic order. You become a member of that order and are also bound by its specific anathema, allowing you to take the order's feats. You become trained in Nature and your order's associated skill; for each of these skills in which you were already trained, you become trained in a skill of your choice. You don't gain any other abilities from your choice of order.

## [[Feats/Vigilant Mask|Vigilant Mask]] Feat 20

*   Rare
*   archetype
*   druid
*   wizard

Your mask grants the extraordinary magical senses of Carmine Jaws, the Hyena who Looks Between. You gain scent as a precise sense to a range of 60 feet. If you already have scent as a precise sense, increase its range by 60 feet. You can sometimes catch a faint whiff of magic itself. Immediately after you Cast a non-cantrip Spell, your scent extends between worlds, like Carmine Jaws's own. This causes you to be able to smell ethereal creatures, those in an extradimensional space with an aperture that's within your scent range, incorporeal creatures and objects, and other creatures and objects that are insubstantial or not fully in phase with reality. Unlike your normal scent, this is an imprecise sense.
