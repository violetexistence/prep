# Winged Warrior
Nature provided wings to certain creatures to help them soar above predators or reach food hanging from tall trees or the side of a cliff. When those graced with wings no longer have to depend on flight for survival, their appendages can be turned to a different use: combat. In addition to granting strategic elevation over foes, wings provide a variety of combat advantages.

Winged warriors are found independently among several ancestries. While awakened animals seem able to use these techniques as if by instinct, tengu of the Inner Sea region are the most commonly seen practitioners of this fighting style. Naval and pirate crews in the Shackles particularly value a tengu's skill at boarding actions. Warriors able to take flight, even temporarily, can often name their price when joining a crew on the Fever Sea. Despite the ranged armaments available on most ships, many sailors are hard-pressed to defend against skilled aerial assailants.

Even those who develop wings later in life, like certain surkis and those with grafted wings, can learn the fighting style of a winged warrior. Although it's a long path, many of the techniques involved are reinvented, rediscovered, and even updated by individual warriors.

Through rigorous training, you have strengthened your wings, granting you enough thrust to gain additional altitude.

Any fly Speed granted by ancestry feats and other permanent wings increases by 5 feet.

## [[Feats/Wing Bounce|Wing Bounce]] Feat 4

## [[Feats/Feathered Flechettes|Feathered Flechettes]] Feat 6

*   archetype

Unfurling your wings in a quick snap, you send feathers scattering in all directions. Creatures in a 15-foot emanation take 6d6 slashing damage (`Reflex check` save against your class DC). This increases to 10d6 slashing if your unarmed attacks have a greater striking rune, such as by etching it onto [[Equipment/Handwraps of Mighty Blows|Handwraps of Mighty Blows]], and 16d6 slashing if they have a major striking rune.

## [[Feats/Sunbird Glare|Sunbird Glare]] Feat 6

*   archetype

**Requirements** You're in bright light.

* * *

By keeping your feathers clean and sleek, you can catch the light across your wings to create a startling glare in the eyes of a creature within 20 feet. The target must succeed at a `Fortitude check` save against your class DC or be [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] for 1 round (1 minute on a critical failure). Regardless of their result, the target is temporarily immune to Sunbird Glare for 10 minutes.

## [[Feats/Wing Shove|Wing Shove]] Feat 8

*   archetype

**Requirements** You're flanked by at least two enemies.

You spread your wings wide, pushing foes away from you. Attempt to [[Actions/Shove|Shove]] one of the flanking enemies, and then make a second Shove attempt against a different enemy that is flanking you. You don't need one hand free. The second Shove attempt has the same multiple attack penalty as the first and doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty. On a success or critical success, you can't Stride after a target, but that target is also [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the beginning of their next turn. On a critical failure, you're off-guard until the beginning of your next turn instead of falling [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]].
