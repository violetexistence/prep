# Celebrity
You're a special personality... and you know it. You're not merely comfortable in the spotlight, you crave it. While the traditional celebrity is a musician or another type of performer, you could be known for any occupation. You know how to use your position to command the attention of others or steal it away from those around you. While you're in a room all eyes are on you, and you love it. Your life is a show, and you are here to steal the love and admiration of everyone watching.
