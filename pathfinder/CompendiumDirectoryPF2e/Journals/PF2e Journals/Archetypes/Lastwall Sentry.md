# Lastwall Sentry

## [[Feats/Always Ready|Always Ready]] Feat 4

*   archetype

Extensive training against undead has taught you to cover your weak points, even when you think that you're alone. You aren't [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] to [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]], [[Conditions/Undetected|Undetected]], or flanking undead of your level or lower. However, the undead can still help their allies flank. If all of your opponents are undead, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to initiative rolls; the GM determines whether to apply this bonus if undead are disguised as another type of creature, if another type of creature is disguised as undead, or if there are additional opponents you haven't noticed who aren't undead.

## [[Feats/Grave Sense|Grave Sense]] Feat 6

*   archetype

Your time spent hunting the undead allows you to sense them. You sense undead as a vague sense similar to a human's sense of smell, an uncomfortable sensation akin to smelling something cloying and rotting. When in proximity to the undead, you eventually sense their presence, though you might not do so instantly, and you can't pinpoint their location. An undead using a disguise or otherwise trying to hide its presence must attempt a Deception check against your Perception DC to hide its presence from you. If the creature succeeds at its Deception check, it is then temporarily immune to your Grave Sense for 1 day.

You've battled more undead than you care to remember, often with little time to prepare between foes, forcing you to rely on experience and muscle memory to guide your blade. Attempt a check to Recall Knowledge about an undead you can see and then Strike that undead. If your attempt to Recall Knowledge is successful, your Strike treats the target's resistances as 5 lower. The target is then immune to your Practiced Opposition for 24 hours.

## [[Feats/Necromantic Bulwark|Necromantic Bulwark]] Feat 8

Regular exposure to necromantic effects left you better able to defend against them.

## [[Feats/Lastwall Warden|Lastwall Warden]] Feat 10

*   archetype

You use your shield to protect your allies, not just yourself, especially against the undead.

## [[Feats/Resolute Defender|Resolute Defender]] Feat 14

*   archetype

You hold your shield together with the power of your faith and conviction, refusing to let wood splinter and steel shatter until the day's battles are won. If a shield would be destroyed due to damage taken during your Shield Block, the shield remains intact at 1 Hit Point instead. Its construction is weakened until you repair it, preventing you from using Resolute Defender to save the same shield again until your next daily preparations.

*   archetype
*   stance
