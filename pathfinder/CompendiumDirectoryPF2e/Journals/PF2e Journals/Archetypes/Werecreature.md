# Werecreature
*   Rare

You're a werecreature, a humanoid doomed by an ancient primal curse to transform into an animal or an animalhumanoid hybrid under the light of the full moon. You might be a "true werecreature," born to werecreature parents; you might have found yourself afflicted with the primal curse after surviving the bite of another werecreature; or you might have been transformed into a werecreature by powerful magic, perhaps even willingly.

Although humanoids with the ability to transform into animals aren't universally feared, they're looked on with terror in many places because of a confusion with werecreatures or other threats. With the curse both spreading infectiously and robbing the afflicted control of their actions, those suspected of being werecreatures can rarely live in peace.

While many werecreatures have little control over their own transformations, formal training or an exceptionally strong will has enabled you to exert a degree of mastery over the beast that rages within you, allowing you not only to assume your bestial shape at will but also retain your own mind while doing so. In many cases, this results in being able to prevent spreading the curse as well. This mastery is more common in societies that embrace or accept werecreatures, such as Ulfen countries in northern Avistan and communities of beastkin, wherever they can be found.

  

| Roleplaying a Werecreature |
| --- |
| As a werecreature, your personality is likely to be heavily influenced by your relationship with the curse that made you what you are. If you were afflicted against your will, you might find yourself locked in an interminable struggle against your condition, even as you're continually tempted by the power it offers; or you might revel in the transformation, embracing your newly empowered bestial side as the purest reflection of your true self. If you were born a true werecreature, perhaps you don't see your condition as a curse at all, but a noble calling; alternately, maybe your upbringing in a community of evil-minded werecreatures has led you to despise your own kin and, by extension, yourself. Consider also how your nature as a werecreature affects your relationships with fellow humanoids: do you see it as your charge to protect them, even as you suspect they might hate and fear you if they knew your true nature, or do you consider yourself a proverbial wolf among sheep?<br/>As your character advances and gains more werecreature feats, you can also explore how the lines between your humanoid side and your bestial side might begin to blur, or choose the alternate route and emphasize the divergence between your dual natures. There is great roleplaying potential in a character whose humanoid and bestial sides contrast so dramatically that they might as well be different characters altogether! |
