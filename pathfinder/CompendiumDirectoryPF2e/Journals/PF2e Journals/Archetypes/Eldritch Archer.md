# Eldritch Archer
While many archers see their craft as an art form as much as a means of battle, a small number of archers seek to perfect their skills through magic, and you are among their number. Bolstering your athletic and martial abilities with mystical talents, you achieve rare heights with the bow or crossbow—transforming arrows or bolts into eldritch ammunition, sending projectiles zig‑zagging unerringly to their targets, and manifesting arrows that can deliver spells or even instant death. The imbuing of raw magic into the point of an arrow is no easy feat. Eldritch archers are respected and feared for their prowess and make valuable members for any party of adventurers.

While having some spellcasting ability increases your flexibility and power as an eldritch archer, you might learn the secrets of these arts without being independently skilled in spellcasting, instead learning the magic of the bow for its own sake. In fact, many eldritch archers begin as archers first and spellcasters second. That is not to say that the occasional spellcaster has not picked up archery. In fact, many wizards, wise in the art of war, have studied the bow, particularly to master this art. Ultimately, what matters is a perfect combination of martial skill and magical ability; the order you go about obtaining them matters little.
