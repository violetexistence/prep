# Archfiend (Uncommon)
*   Uncommon

Fiends are legion. From the scheming, tyrannical devils and the sinful, soul-coveting demons, to the terrifying sahkils and the unknowable qlippoth, they come in countless forms and are more numerous than the stars in the sky, the sands upon the beach, and the sins of morals. Beings of cruelty and malice, cunning and corruption, fiends revel in bloodshed, violence, and destruction. These are the forces you're destined to join and eventually rule over—the servants and soldiers who will protect your domain, carry out your orders, and destroy your enemies.

Through your Calling, you're destined to become an archfiend, a powerful leader, general, or tyrant who rules over your own extraplanar realm and amasses a following of fiends. A devious archdevil who rises through the ranks of Hell's hierarchy, a powerful demon lord who seizes their realm in the Outer Rifts by bloody coup, a fearmongering sahk il tormentor who builds a palace of nightmares in their own personal demiplane, and a sadistic velstrac demagogue who cuts a swath of agony through the Netherworld—all are archfiends. And while their motives, methods, domains, and minions differ, the evil they cause and the power they wield are universal. Archfiends are fiends of legend, whose names live on forever, both among their own kind and the mortals who fear them. The most powerful of archfiends gain a horde of fiendish followers who help them bring evil to the mortal realms.

**Moloch** (tyrannical male devil general), General of Hell, rules Malebolge and directs Hell's armies from Melqart Keep at the heart of Citadel Ba'al. The Lord of the Sixth personifies wrathful destruction held in check by absolute discipline, and those who honor him often find their enemies crushed by the might of his armies.

Scheming in his twisted tree lair known as the Witchbole, the Lord of the Blasted Tarn, **Treerazer** (corrupting male demon deforester), seeks dominion over the Tanglebriar. Once a powerful aspiring demon lord, the fiend was banished to the Universe long ago and seeks revenge against the elven deities who imprisoned him within the surrounding forest and all they hold dear.

Searching for the perfect beings so she can end all others, **Raetorgash** (cruel female velstrac demagogue), the Skull-Hoarder, resides in a bone tower at the heart of the charnel house Targothieh with the Netherworld. She often judges potential subjects by the shape and composition of their skulls, usually by first having them removed from the containing skin and muscle.

You wish to number among these mythic beings. You have been gathering power, whether through the study of occult tomes, the accumulation of wealth, or the manipulation of heedless pawns in political spheres. You hold little regard for much of anything except your own goals, though you might briefly ally yourself with others for mutual protection or financial gain. However, should the need arise, you are prepared to abandon those ties without so much as a second thought. After all, you are destined to sit upon a throne that has room for only one —and that is you. The time has come for you to establish your realm, amass your fiendish hordes, and carve your own legend into the annals of history.

  

| An Archfiend's Realm |
| --- |
| From the circles of Hell to the layers of the Outer Rifts, fiends are usually linked to their particular realm with an archfiend holding dominion over that area. To fulfill your destiny as a ruthless fiendish tyrant, you must know the lands you will eventually rule. You begin by manifesting the idea of your realm onto the real world, but you shouldn't need to worry about your realm's future planar location. After all, Hell isn't only filled with fire—there are areas of freezing cold and grasping shadow within its circles. Get creative with the description of your realm as it will be where you'll be spending eternity! |

  

| What is a Fiend? |
| --- |
| There are far more fiends in existence than mortal eyes have ever glimpsed, and an immortal could ever count. While cataloging them all is a hopeless endeavor, fiends are grouped into categories—types of fiends with a common goal, purpose, outlook, and origins. These fiends include demons, devils, qlippoth, sahkils, and velstracs.<br/>**Demons** reside in the Outer Rifts, revel in sin and spreading corruption, and are ruled by demon lords.<br/>**Devils** reside in Hell, are manipulative tyrants, and are ruled by archdevils.<br/>**Qlippoth** reside in the Outer Rifts, despise demons and mortals alike, and are ruled by qlippoth lords.<br/>**Sahkils** reside in the Ethereal Plane, sow terror through nightmares, and are ruled by tormentors.<br/>**Velstracs** reside in the Netherworld, delight in torture and spreading pain, and are ruled by demagogues. |

## [[Feats/Archfiend Dedication|Archfiend Dedication]] Feat 12

*   Uncommon
*   destiny
*   mythic

Driven by your Calling, you've begun to make plans for your own personal realm from whence you're destined to rule over an army of fiends. Name your realm and describe its eventual appearance. Whether it contains raging hellfire, ponds of caustic acid, or banks of poisonous fog, your realm should be marked by distinctive terrain. Select one of the following damage types associated with your realm's environmental dangers: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or poison. This is your realm's damage type. You gain resistance to the selected damage type equal to half your level. If you already have resistance to this damage type, increase your resistance by 5.

The certainty of your will is such that you can temporarily bring forth a portion of your realm into this world. You gain the [[Actions/Manifest Realm|Manifest Realm]] ability. Other feats allow you to further manipulate your manifested realm.

## [[Feats/Don Thy Fervor|Don Thy Fervor]] Feat 14

## [[Feats/Lord of the Fiends|Lord of the Fiends]] Feat 14

*   mythic

You consider every fiend a future subject and can assess them at a glance. Spend a Mythic Point. Attempt a check at mythic proficiency to Recall Knowledge about every fiend you can see. For the next hour, whenever you roll a success on a Deception, Diplomacy, or Intimidation check against a fiend, you get a critical success instead.

## [[Feats/Manipulate Realm|Manipulate Realm]] Feat 14

*   mythic

Thanks to your continued belief in your ultimate transformation, you have learned greater control over your manifested realm. If you spend a Mythic Point when you Manifest your Realm, you can use the [[Actions/Drain Realm|Drain Realm]], [[Actions/Spread Realm|Spread Realm]], and [[Actions/Unleash Realm|Unleash Realm]] free actions.

## [[Feats/Marshall Fiendish Forces|Marshall Fiendish Forces]] Feat 16

*   mythic

You have been in contact with a retinue of fiends, brokering all manner of deals so that they may eventually serve you. When you [[Actions/Manifest Realm|Manifest your Realm]], you can choose to have one such fiend come to your aid. This fiend is a common fiend of level 11 or lower, which you select when you take this feat. The fiend appears in a place of your choosing within your manifested realm and has the minion trait. They remain for as long as your realm is manifested, until they're reduced to 0 Hit Points, or until you command them to leave, at which point they immediately vanish and return to their place of origin.

At 20th level, you can choose a common fiend of level 15 or lower to appear instead when you Manifest your Realm.

## [[Feats/Realm Strider|Realm Strider]] Feat 16

*   mythic

You can teleport across the battlefield, disappearing and appearing in a burst of hellfire and brimstone, a flash of lightning, a cloud of caustic gas, or other environmental hazard common within your planned realm. You can cast [[Spells/Translocate|Translocate]] as a 4th-rank divine innate spell at will. When you do, spaces adjacent to the one you leave from and the one you appear in are momentarily filled with a damaging energy common to your realm, dealing 4d6 damage of your realm's damage type to creatures in the affected spaces (`Reflex check` save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher).

## [[Feats/Seat of Power|Seat of Power]] Feat 16

*   mythic

Your sheer determination has created a demiplane that houses a grand residence which will serve as the heart of your planned realm. You determine the appearance of this seat of power, such as a duskwood longhouse, a crumbling stone castle, an ice tower, or a pagoda constructed from the solidified souls of the damned.

You can enter your realm using the [[Actions/Enter Seat Of Power|Enter Seat Of Power]] activity. You and any creatures you choose gain three times as many Hit Points when resting within your seat of power. Once per day while within your seat of power, you can cast [[Spells/Cleanse Affliction|Cleanse Affliction]] as a 4th-rank innate divine spell or [[Spells/Sound Body|Sound Body]] as a 4th-rank innate divine spell. You can target only yourself with these spells.

## [[Feats/Brandish Authority|Brandish Authority]] Feat 18

*   auditory
*   mythic
*   visual

With a terrifying pronouncement, you manifest a visible sign of your authority and fiendish power, such as a crown of flame upon your brow, a scepter forged of solidified souls, or a throne comprised of a dozen dragon skulls. This object appears in your space or in your hand, as appropriate, and remains for 1 minute. When your sign of power appears, attempt an Intimidation check to [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] each enemy within 30 feet who can see or hear you. These Demoralize attempts don't take any penalty for not sharing a language. As long as your sign of power remains manifested, your enemies can't reduce the value of their [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened]] condition below 1.

You can spend 1 Mythic Point as part of performing this action; if you do, frightened creatures grovel before you, in awe of your terrible power. At the beginning of their turn, a creature that has the frightened condition from Brandish Authority must attempt a `Will check` saving throw against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. On failure, they must [[Actions/Drop Prone|Drop Prone]]. On a critical failure, they must Drop Prone and can't Stand this turn.

## [[Feats/Imprison Foe|Imprison Foe]] Feat 18

*   mythic
*   teleportation

**Requirements** Your last action dealt damage to a creature.

* * *

Rather than grant your foes the mercy of a swift death, you can consign them to suffer in an extradimensional prison with an appearance of your choosing. Spend 1 Mythic Point to force a creature that you dealt damage to with your last action to attempt a `Will check` saving throw against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. Regardless of the result, the target is temporarily immune to your Imprison Foe for 24 hours.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target is [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 2]].

**Failure** The target is transported into a cell within your extradimensional dungeon for 1 minute. It is unable to leave or damage the cell in any way. Teleportation effects can't carry the target outside the cell unless they can also traverse the planes, such as interplanar teleport. At the end of each of its turns, it can attempt a new Will save to reduce the remaining duration it is imprisoned by 1 round or end it entirely on a critical success. When the duration ends, the target returns to the space it occupied when it was imprisoned, or to the nearest space if the original is now filled.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target is stunned for the first round it is imprisoned.

## [[Feats/Profane Bargain|Profane Bargain]] Feat 18

*   Rare
*   divine
*   mental
*   mythic

You can strike a profane bargain with a willing, sapient creature. That creature promises to never take hostile actions against you, to never lie to you, to never speak of this bargain, and to either perform, or refrain from performing, one other specified task, such as paying you a specified sum every year, gifting you their first-born child, or never speaking.

If the target accepts, they verbally make a request. You can choose to twist their request by selecting specific details, as long as you still fulfill the requirements of their request. If the request could be granted by a [[Spells/Wish|Wish]] ritual, you spend 1 Mythic Point and the request is magically granted.

As long as the bargain persists, you always know the target's location, can communicate telepathically with the target at any distance, and can see through the target's senses by taking a single action that has the concentrate trait. Once per day, you can take control of the target as an activity that takes three actions and has the concentrate trait. When you do, they become [[Conditions/Controlled|Controlled]] by you for 10 minutes. They have no memory of their time spent under your control.

If the target ever breaks the terms of this bargain, you immediately select one of the following punishments: they die, they die and you possess their soul, they become permanently controlled by you, or they become imprisoned in a cell within your realm's dungeon (you must have the [[Feats/Imprison Foe|Imprison Foe]] feat to select this final option).

A target can only enter into a Profane Bargain with you once—not even the breaking of this bargain, death, a _wish_ ritual, or divine intervention frees them of this limitation. You can't make a Profane Bargain with yourself.

## [[Feats/Fiend Eternal|Fiend Eternal]] Feat 20

*   mythic

Through all your machinations and accumulation of power, you have completed your apotheosis and become a true archfiend. You gain the fiend and unholy traits and are immune to your realm's damage type. You don't age. Your planned realm becomes a complete reality, forming within a section of Hell, the Outer Rifts, the Netherworld, its own fiendish demiplane, or some other planar space of your choosing. If you have the [[Feats/Seat of Power|Seat of Power]] feat, that seat of power is grafted onto your realm and the [[Actions/Enter Seat Of Power|Enter Seat Of Power]] activity transports you to any place within your realm; otherwise, you can enter and exit your realm in a similar fashion with a brief ritual that takes 10 minutes (though you can't bring anyone with you).

Whenever you would die, you are instead reduced to 0 Hit Points, become [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]], and are immediately transported to your seat of power within your realm. After 1 hour (or 1 round if you have the Seat of Power feat), you regain 5 Hit Points and reawaken. You can't leave your realm until you're fully healed or 1 week passes (whichever comes first).

In addition, you gain a small group of fiendish followers who reside in your realm. They never leave your realm (though one might occasionally come to your aid if you have the [[Feats/Marshall Fiendish Forces|Marshall Fiendish Forces]] feat), but they constantly spy on the mortal world to keep you informed. You are telepathically linked to these followers and can choose to speak with the group, or a specific fiend, as a three-action activity that has the concentrate trait. In doing so, you can avail yourself of the fiends' surveillance to learn about the world or current events. You can either [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] on any topic or [[Actions/Gather Information|Gather Information]]. If you critically fail to do either, you get a failure instead.
