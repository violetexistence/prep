# Wild Mimic
Wild beasts of all kinds can be found outside of the cities and villages of Golarion, and many possess remarkable abilities that help them survive, even thrive. From the capacity to fight through deadly wounds to the production of painful electric jolts, the multitude of the world's beasts presents a staggering array of diversity in form. Through rigorous training of your body, the meticulous study of treatises on wildlife, or by spending a large portion of your life among them, you have learned to adopt the martial techniques of many beasts. Some of these are a matter of simple mimicry, while others are impressive displays of primal magic.

The style of wild mimicry is believed to have been created long ago in the Realm of the Mammoth Lords. Hunters took on the aspects of local prehistoric beasts to better stalk and kill them for survival. In this constant struggle against nature, quick adaptation is key. In more recent decades, whether through convergent development or by adherents showcasing their techniques as they travel, wild mimicry has been found all across Golarion, from the Valashmai Jungle in Tian Xia to the coasts of Droon in southern Garund to anywhere large numbers of beasts can be encountered.
