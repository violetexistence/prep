# Dual-Weapon Warrior
You're able to effortlessly fight with multiple weapons simultaneously, weaving your weapons together into a storm of quick attacks. To you, continual offense is the best form of defense, and you leave little room for your foes to avoid your whirlwind of weapons. Your unconventional fighting style still manages to weave in a unique kind of defense, blocking blade with blade, all without sacrificing power. Speed is your friend, and stagnation can mean ruin. Your attacks come fast and from unexpected angles. Become one with the blur of weapons and find victory.

## [[Feats/Dual Thrower|Dual Thrower]] Feat 4

*   archetype

You know how to throw two weapons as easily as strike with them. Whenever a feat you gained from the dual-weapon warrior archetype allows you to make a melee Strike, you can instead make a ranged Strike with a thrown weapon or a one-handed ranged weapon you are wielding (weapons that need "1+" hand, such as longbows, don't qualify).

Any effects from these feats that apply to one-handed melee weapons or melee Strikes also apply to one-handed ranged weapons and ranged Strikes.

## [[Feats/Flensing Slice|Flensing Slice]] Feat 8

*   archetype

**Requirements** Your last action was a [[Feats/Double Slice|Double Slice]], and both attacks hit the target.

* * *

When you hit with both attacks with Double Slice, you flense the target, making it bleed and creating a weak spot.

The target takes 1d8 bleed per weapon damage die of whichever of the weapons you used that has the most weapon damage dice (maximum 4d8 for a _major striking_ weapon).

The target becomes off-guard, and its resistances to any physical damage types are reduced by 5; these two effects last until the beginning of your next turn.

## [[Feats/Dual-Weapon Blitz|Dual-Weapon Blitz]] Feat 10

*   archetype

**Requirements** You are wielding two one-handed melee weapons, each in a different hand.

* * *

You attack as you weave your way around the battlefield. Stride up to your Speed. During this movement, you can Strike once with each of the two one-handed melee weapons. Each of these Strikes can be made at any point during your movement.

## [[Feats/Dual Onslaught|Dual Onslaught]] Feat 14

*   archetype

When you lash out with both weapons, you leave no room for the target to escape your attack.

When you use [[Feats/Double Slice|Double Slice]], if you miss with both [[Actions/Strike|Strikes]], choose one of the two weapons and apply the effects of a hit with that weapon.

You can't choose a weapon if your attack roll with that weapon was a critical failure, meaning you still miss entirely if both attack rolls were critical failures.
