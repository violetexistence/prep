# Lion Blade
*   Uncommon

You've trained as a spy in service of Taldor, learning secrets of disguise, manipulating crowds, and deceiving various sorts of magic users with ease. You likely dropped out of the Kitharodian Academy, Taldor's premier bardic college, in order to train at one of the Lion Blade's elite Shadow Schools.

**Prerequisites** member of the Lion Blades, trained in Performance

**Access** You're from Taldor.

Your Lion Blade spy training helps you conceal yourself and your identity. You become trained in your choice of Deception or Stealth; if you were already trained in that skill, you become an expert instead. You also gain the [[Feats/Additional Lore|Additional Lore]] skill feat for Espionage Lore. If you were already trained in Espionage Lore, you also become trained in a Lore skill of your choice.

You never take circumstance penalties for attempting to take a disguise of a different ancestry, age, and so on, as long as the disguised form is appropriate for your size.

## [[Feats/Spy's Countermeasures|Spy's Countermeasures]] Feat 10

*   archetype

**Trigger** You succeed at a save against a detection, mental, or scrying effect.

* * *

You've learned how to analyze and fake your responses to the most common magic used against spies. You can attempt to identify the effect via [[Actions/Identify Magic|Identify Magic]] using the magical tradition skill of the effect or Espionage Lore, even if you didn't notice the spell being cast.

If you successfully identify the triggering effect, and it would normally fail or have no effect, you can make the caster of the triggering effect think the effect or spell succeeded. If they would obtain a result, such as receive a piece of information, you decide what that result is. If the effect would influence you to take certain actions, you can make it appear as if you were affected and attempt to play along; if the effect normally establishes a mental link, it functions normally, but you can disregard any commands you receive through the link.

## [[Feats/Flickering Twirl|Flicker]] Feat 12

*   archetype

You use your movements and disguises to make yourself a flickering blur. You gain [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealment]] until your next turn. As usual for concealment involving an obvious visual manifestation, you can't use this concealment to [[Actions/Hide|Hide]].
