# Duelist
All across the world, students in fencing academies practice with their weapons to master one-on-one combat. The libraries of these schools contain troves of information, detailing hundreds of combat techniques, battle stances, and honorable rules of engagement. Those who gain admission to such training classes might duel in formalized settings—and that's certainly the more genteel route to take. However, others assert that there's no better training ground for duels than the chaotic life of an adventurer. In such situations, a flexible, single‑handed fighting style is invaluable. You never know when you'll need an extra hand to shove a foe, haul open a door, or grab valuable loot. You can accomplish such deeds with style and grace. Regardless of your method, fighters such as you are feared across the land.

## [[Feats/Duelist's Challenge|Duelist's Challenge]] Feat 4

*   archetype

Select one enemy you can see and proclaim a challenge against it. That enemy is your dueling opponent until it's defeated, it flees from the encounter, or the encounter ends. Any time you hit that enemy using a single one-handed melee weapon while your other hand or hands are free, you gain a circumstance bonus to the Strike's damage equal to the number of damage dice your weapon deals.

If you attack a creature other than your dueling opponent, you take a circumstance penalty to damage equal to the number of damage dice your weapon deals.

## [[Feats/Tut-Tut|Tut-Tut]] Feat 4

*   Uncommon
*   archetype
*   emotion
*   fear
*   mental
*   press

**Trigger** You hit a creature with a melee attack roll.

* * *

The Sapphire Butterfly is not one for violence when simply intimidating a foe will do. From that vigilante's techniques, you've learned how to pull a deadly blow at the last moment, threatening your target instead of striking them. Rather than dealing damage with the triggering Strike, attempt an Intimidation check with a +2 circumstance bonus to [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] all enemies within 30 feet who can see you. If you critically succeed at your check to Demoralize the target of your Strike, their attitude toward you improves by one step while they also become [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]].

## [[Feats/Selfless Parry|Selfless Parry]] Feat 8

*   archetype

You protect those near to you with a flash of steel and a stroke of good luck. When you're benefiting from Dueling Parry, allies adjacent to you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC. If you have [[Feats/Dueling Riposte|Dueling Riposte]], you can use it when an enemy within your reach critically fails a Strike against an ally adjacent to you, not just against yourself.

## [[Feats/Student of the Dueling Arts|Student of the Dueling Arts]] Feat 12

*   archetype

Dueling is your art, and your weapon is your instrument. You have studied and evaluated a great many combat techniques, which you can review each day without fail to ensure you are prepared for any and every situation that may occur. During your daily preparations, you can swap out any number of your duelist archetype feats for other duelist archetype feats of the appropriate level for which you are qualified. You can't swap out Duelist Dedication or Student of the Dueling Arts in this way.

In addition, you can enter a stance from a duelist archetype feat you don't have (such as one listed under Additional Feats) by increasing the number of actions it takes to enter the stance by 1 (typically to 2 actions). You must still meet the stance feat's prerequisites.
