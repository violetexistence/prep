# Tattooed Historian
*   Uncommon

In Belkzen, an important part of a storyteller's arsenal is body artâ€”anything from depictions of past events to illustrate a legend to gruesome scars that prove the bearer faced real danger and survived. Belkzen orcs with extensive body art and scars are often dubbed historians for the stories they carry. The greatest of them can unlock these stories' intrinsic magic to perform supernatural feats. A tattooed historian commands respect and reverence, often allowing them to travel safely among Belkzen's holds.

This archetype represents the Belkzen version of a tattooed historian; other cultures might have developed variations of this tradition with different prerequisites.

## [[Feats/Tattooed Historian Dedication|Tattooed Historian Dedication]] Feat 2

*   Uncommon
*   archetype
*   dedication

**Prerequisites** Constitution +1, trained in Belkzen Lore, Orc Lore, Orc Pantheon Lore, or (at the GM's discretion) a related Lore skill

* * *

You become trained in Diplomacy or Performance; if you are already trained in both skills, you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You gain access to all uncommon magical tattoos with the orc trait.

You gain a [[Equipment/Storied Skin|Storied Skin]] for free upon gaining this feat (or another magical tattoo of 2nd level or lower if you already have storied skin). You cannot have more than one storied skin tattoo, but the frequency of its Living History ability increases by one use per minute for every three tattooed historian feats you have. For every two tattooed historian feats you have, you can invest one magical tattoo that does not count against the maximum number of items you can have invested at one time.

## [[Feats/Agent of all Holds|Agent of all Holds]] Feat 2

*   Uncommon
*   archetype

**Trigger** You critically fail a Diplomacy, Intimidation, or Performance check.

* * *

Orcs across Belkzen recognize you as an honored lorekeeper. You're adept at leveraging this status and showing off your tattoos to resolve conflicts, change minds, or distract others from a faux pas. You get a failure on the check, rather than a critical failure. If the triggering check was made against a creature with the orc trait, you can instead add the fortune trait to this ability and reroll the check, treating any critical failure as a failure.

## [[Feats/Inked Panoply|Inked Panoply]] Feat 4

*   Uncommon
*   archetype

**Trigger** A creature targets you with an attack, and you can see the attacker.

* * *

Your tattoos can briefly animate and extend from your skin, granting you a spectral shield-bearer who protects you from harm. Doing so expends one use of your storied skin, granting you a +1 circumstance bonus to AC against the triggering attack. In addition, you gain resistance to mental, spirit, and void damage equal to twice your number of tattooed historian feats against the triggering attack.

## [[Feats/Infused with Belkzen's Might|Infused with Belkzen's Might]] Feat 6

*   Uncommon
*   archetype

Your tattoos immortalize the conquests of orc war leaders, such as Belkzen besieging the dwarven Sky Citadel of Koldukar. You can expend one use of your storied skin's Living History ability to channel this power into your own weapons. Until the end of your next turn, you deal additional spirit damage with weapons and unarmed attacks equal to 1 plus half the number of Tattooed Historian feats you have.

## [[Feats/Inscribed with Elders' Deeds|Inscribed with Elders' Deeds]] Feat 6

*   Uncommon
*   archetype

Your tattoos commemorate unique exploits that (according to legends) only an orc could accomplish. During your daily preparations, you can reconfigure part of your storied skin to depict a specific orc hero, granting you a 1st-level ancestry feat with the orc trait until you prepare again; this ancestry feat cannot require any physiological feature you lack, as determined by the GM. Since this feat is temporary, you can't use it as a prerequisite for permanent character options, such as for a feat. At 13th level, you can instead gain a 5th-level ancestry feat with the orc trait.

## [[Feats/Wrath of the Hold|Wrath of the Hold]] Feat 8

*   Uncommon
*   archetype
*   occult

Your tattoos carry the strength of an innumerable horde, and you can expend one use of your storied skin's Living History ability to animate your tattoos as ghostly assailants that swarm your foes. These spirits attack all foes in a 30-foot cone, dealing 0d6 spirit damage. The damage increases by 1d6 at 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter. Each affected creature must attempt a `Will check` saving throw against the higher of your class DC or spell DC.
