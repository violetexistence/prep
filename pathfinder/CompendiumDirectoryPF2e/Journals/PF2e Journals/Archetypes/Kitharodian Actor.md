# Kitharodian Actor
*   Rare

Some performers at Kitharodian Academy are so dedicated to method acting that they can completely disappear into roles in a manner that's almost magical. These thespians are capable of mimicking Taldor's vast array of stage-immortalized luminaries via vivid impressions, awe-inspiring vocal performances, and wild stunts that defy all expectations. The Academy's foremost instructors and senior Lion Blades agents keep a close eye on all prodigies who show a sliver of this potential, helping them harness their talents for use in both the acting world and the world of spycraft.

Through Taldor's long history, a handful of classic roles have been repeated and hammered into shape until they became icons and metaphors that define the art of Taldor. Although some of these are symbols of national strength, like First Emperor Taldaris, many are tragic or even comedic figures like Emperor Beldam I. Accepting any one of these roles in a high-profile production can be the highlight of an actor's career, but the best of the best gather these roles like trophies.

Newer roles are added to the canon very slowly, with modern figures like Grand Princess Eutropia usually alluded to with references from other roles. Many performances with Cyricas and his animal friends now feature a dog at his side, for example, as a reference to the grand princess's beloved pet.

Although the most famous internationally, Kitharodian Academy is not the sole repository of Taldor's stories. Many other schools in Taldor, like the nearby Rhapsodic College, teach the classics. But these plays and songs are such a deeply rooted part of Taldor's culture that prodigies arise from the soldiers of Zimar to the dwarven enclaves in Maheto.

In addition, when you attempt a Deception or Performance check to portray a famous figure, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your check. This bonus changes to +3 at 10th level and +4 at 17th level.

You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to all checks to Command an Animal and [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] about creatures with the animal trait. You can use your chosen animal Lore to Command an Animal of that type.

## [[Feats/Heaven's Step Offense|Heaven's Step Offense]] Feat 4

*   archetype

**Trigger** Your melee Strike reduces a creature to 0 Hit Points

* * *

Your lessons from the stage find life in the storied mercy and fearlessness of Grand Prince Gennaris III. With a theatrical flourish, the Strike becomes nonlethal, and you can Stride up to half your Speed in a straight line toward another enemy. This attention-arresting movement does not provoke reactions from enemies unless they are immune to mental effects.

## [[Feats/Monumental Maestro|Monumental Maestro]] Feat 8

You've studied the moving compositions of Andreas Romung, a legendary maestro whose Shining Crusade anthems live on in the music for the play Echoes of Glory.

## [[Feats/Stunt Performer Stance|Stunt Performer Stance]] Feat 10

*   archetype
*   stance

**Requirements** You are unarmored.

* * *

You clear your mind, regulate your breathing, and prepare your muscles in a stance inspired by Kemen Kayton, a graduate of Zimar's Monastery of the Seven Forms. Kemen controversially shunned monastic life and instead used his martial skills as a death-defying stunt performer, winning acclaim for exhibitions that saw him survive great falls and escape deadly traps. While in this stance, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Reflex saving throws and skill checks to [[Actions/Escape|Escape]], as well as resistance 2 to all physical damage.

## [[Feats/Bleak Humorist|Bleak Humorist]] Feat 12

*   archetype
*   emotion
*   linguistic
*   mental

**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** You are reduced to 0 Hit Points by a creature within 30 feet, but not immediately killed

* * *

You've watched dozens of morbid comedies depicting Beldam I, Taldor's prankster emperor whose wife accidentally killed him when she struck him with a marble bust after he jumped out from behind curtains to frighten her. You are reminded of this depressing yet perversely comical tale whenever you are near death, and in your final moments of consciousness you murmur a bleak joke to the creature who reduced you to 0 Hit Points. The creature must attempt a `Will check` save against your class DC.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target is distracted by giggles and can't use reactions until the beginning of your next turn.

**Failure** The target laughs uncontrollably. It can't use reactions until the beginning of your next turn and is [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]].

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target also immediately falls [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]].

## [[Feats/Sympathetic Portrayal|Sympathetic Portrayal]] Feat 12

*   archetype

You portrayed Grand Prince Stavian III in Fall of the Troubled King, a production dedicated to the life and times of the paranoid Taldan ruler whose violent resistance to new policies on succession kicked off the War for the Crown. Your acting won rave reviews for recasting Stavian's paranoia and political machinations in a sympathetic light, and you've learned to apply these subtle techniques outside of the stage to win others over. Whenever you succeed at a Deception or Performance check to portray a famous figure, you can select one creature within 60 feet who observed your performance. As long as this creature isn't hostile, its attitude toward you automatically improves by two steps (three steps if your check was a critical success). If it's hostile, it's [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] for 1 minute as it tries to reconcile its desire to harm you with its newfound sympathy for you.

## [[Feats/Of Lions and Wyrms|Of Lions and Wyrms]] Feat 14

*   archetype

You starred in a war drama depicting First Emperor Taldaris's battles against the Grogrisant, a massive six-eyed lion, and Verksaris the Kingeater, a mighty dragon. To prepare for your role, you spent weeks in the wild observing and occasionally scrapping with any creature resembling Taldaris's legendary foes. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against effects from beasts and dragons.

## [[Feats/Ruthless Orator|Ruthless Orator]] Feat 16

*   archetype
*   auditory
*   emotion
*   linguistic
*   mental

**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

You were once cast in the role of Daronlyr XII, one of Taldor's most ambitious rulers who slew his cousin to seize the crown, yet somehow still managed to convince the entire Ulfen Guard to swear loyalty to him simply through his powers of oration. You attempt a `Performance check` check to launch into a powerful monologue, pulling lines from Daronlyr's playbook to win respect from everyone around you, even your enemies. The DC of this check is a hard difficulty DC of your level. On a success, any hostile creatures within 20 feet take a â€“2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls and spell attack rolls that target you until the beginning of your next turn, and any allies within 20 feet are [[Conditions/Quickened|Quickened]] until the beginning of your next turn. The additional action can be only used to Strike or Stride.
