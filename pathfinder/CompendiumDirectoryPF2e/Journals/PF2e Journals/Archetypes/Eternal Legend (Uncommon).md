# Eternal Legend (Uncommon)
*   Uncommon

Do you ever consider your death? That grand thing that reaches us all, the consequence of life. The shadow cast by light. Do you ever consider your death? Do you ever think about the life that follows it? Pick up your blade, warrior. If your death is won in glory, you will be remembered for all time. That is the true path to immortality.

Woven into the threads of all cultures and traditions are various heroic champions, whose epic battles and martial exploits are sung of in hymns and sea shanties, whispered in hushed reverent tones, or sometimes deified and sacrificed to with burnt offerings. To be an eternal legend is to be one of these heroes. Whether with blade, bow, or fist, your deeds will live forever through stories and poems, your very essence woven into the fabric of the universe.

Think of a grand warrior, whose deeds of valor are witnessed by peons and infantry soldiers, the stories of which are then passed down to their friends and family back home. That warrior s name might be altered or mangled in the process, but he will be remembered all the same. The way his blade captured the light of the sun, the way his mien was that of a mighty king or celestial. When he is inevitably slain by the one stronger than him (for there will always be someone stronger), he will die with a grin. For his blade will become a sacred treasure upon which nations will be founded, his name the bedrock of religions. But for now, his entrance into a tavern is met with hushed whispers that he returns with a gregarious wink. Or perhaps his passage through this world goes unheeded until that fateful day he joins the ranks of the dead.

Ponder **The Old Man** (wise male human herald), whose real name has been forgotten, replaced by an epithet. Did he ever have a real name? As a herald of the god Irori, The Old Man has helped many monks achieve their full potential and been the inspiration for several fighting styles. But don t let his wizened appearance fool you. His fists are as hard as stone, his movements as swift as the wind. Do not cross The Old Man if you wish for all your bones to remain unbroken and your skin unbruised.

Consider **Torman Iates** (risk-taking male human nomarch), renowned gladiator of Absalom. After emerging triumphant from countless battles within the Irorium arena, the grizzled human has parlayed his fame into successful careers as a tavern owner and local politician. He sits as a nomarch on the Low Council of Absalom, where he helps pass legislation to aid ex-fighters like himself. Because of this, Torman is respected and well-liked by those who fight for coin.

Contemplate the grand traveling warrior **Halimess** (ferocious female dromaar freedom fighter), whose cloak is made of white tiger pelt, whose helm is plated with the scales of dragons, and whose blades are crafted from the teeth of deep-sea leviathans. She travels the land not slaying monsters, but helping commoners, standing up to tyrants, and working the fields when others cannot. She is rarely forced to unsheathe her blade, but when she does, her legend grows. Many intelligent monsters even fear her approach.

Suppose that any of these individuals are—or have the potential to be—eternal legends. They are unforgettable paragons of might and unmatched exemplars of finesse. In the face of insurmountable odds, they stand with conviction and determination. In that vein, you have answered the call of the eternal legend. Your life will not be an easy one; no, you will face tribulations. You will end most of your days with aching muscles and the blood of your foes drying upon your armor. Your battles will be like songs sung amidst storms—the pounding of a drum mixing with the rumble of thunder. Hold steadfast your weapon, clench tightly your fist, and tales of your exploits will become the myths of tomorrow!

  

| The Unforgotten Blade |
| --- |
| The eternal legend mythic destiny is themed around a character whose mighty deeds will be continually told of in traditional songs, bedtime stories, and local legends. The hero's exploits may get exaggerated or misattributed, but what matters is the spirit of the tale: an individual whose strength, agility, cunning, or wisdom allowed them to perform seemingly impossible tasks or prevail against insurmountable odds. These stories often give hope to those who might be struggling in their lives, hoping one day that the hero will return to save them. Or, more importantly, spurring them to perform their own great deeds!<br/>While many of the feats in this destiny revolve around battle prowess, your tales need not only be the clashing of blades and the spilling of blood. Perhaps you once took down a tyrant with a single well-placed word. Perhaps you won a drinking contest against an entire garrison of soldiers to free a captive ally. Perhaps you crafted a shield from moonbeams and carried it into battle against an army of werewolves. Whatever your legend, you won't soon be forgotten! |

## [[Feats/Eternal Legend Dedication|Eternal Legend Dedication]] Feat 12

*   Uncommon
*   destiny
*   mythic

As your renown as a fighter grows, your Calling comes to fruition. Almost nothing can keep you down. During your daily preparations, choose [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy]], [[Conditions/Drained|Drained]], or [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled]]. For the remainder of the day, when you roll a success against an effect that would impose that condition on you, you get a critical success instead. In addition, anytime you gain the chosen condition, reduce its value by 1. You can change the chosen condition with a single action that has the concentrate trait.

## [[Feats/Demolishing Knockback|Demolishing Knockback]] Feat 14

*   flourish
*   mythic

You make a forceful attack that has the power to push your foe through walls. Spend a Mythic Point and make a Strike at mythic proficiency. If you hit and deal damage to the target, you push them up to 15 feet away from you. If this movement would cause the target to collide with an object that has a hardness of 5 or less, the object breaks and the target is pushed through the object's space for the remainder of the forced movement, taking an additional 2d6 bludgeoning damage (the GM can decide that this is a different type of damage depending on the object the target was pushed through; for instance, slashing damage if the target is pushed through a pane of glass).

If the forced movement doesn't cause the target to collide with an object, the target must succeed at a `Reflex check` saving throw against your class DC or be knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] at the end of the movement.

## [[Feats/Earth to Heavens Strike|Earth to Heavens Strike]] Feat 14

*   mythic

Your blows hamper both a foe's mobility and cognitive functions by focusing first on their lower extremities and then their head. Make a Strike; if you hit and deal damage, the creature is also [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 1]] until the end of your next turn. Then, make another Strike against the same creature. If that Strike hits and deals damage, the creature is also [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] until the end of your next turn. If both Strikes hit and deal damage, the duration of both conditions increases to 1 minute. Each Strike counts toward your multiple attack penalty, but you don't increase your multiple attack penalty until after you've made both Strikes.

## [[Feats/Faultless Defense|Faultless Defense]] Feat 14

*   mythic

**Trigger** You would take damage from a Strike made by a creature.

* * *

As you are struck, your steely determination reminds those who fight you that they are destined to be no more than footnotes in your tale. Spend a Mythic Point to gain resistance equal to half your level to the triggering damage, and then attempt a Strike at mythic proficiency against the creature that attacked you. If the Strike hits and deals damage, the creature is also [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]].

## [[Feats/Immovable Object|Immovable Object]] Feat 14

*   mythic
*   stance

You plant your feet in a wide stance, resisting all movement not of your own volition. While in this stance and on the ground, you are immune to forced movement and if an effect would knock you [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]], you aren't knocked prone and can Step as a free action.

## [[Feats/Scattering Shout|Scattering Shout]] Feat 14

*   mythic

With a flex of your mighty thews and a guttural bellow that can make ears bleed, you drive back any enemies surrounding you. Each enemy within a 10-foot emanation must attempt a `Fortitude check` saving throw against your class DC.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature is pushed 5 feet away from you.

**Failure** The creature is pushed 10 feet away from you and takes 8d6 sonic damage.

## [[Feats/Death from Above (Eternal Legend)|Death from Above (Eternal Legend)]] Feat 16

*   mythic

**Requirements** You are adjacent to a climbable surface at least 10 feet tall.

* * *

Seemingly to defy gravity, you use a nearby vertical surface to propel yourself upward and then strike downward like the driving rain. Stride up to half your Speed upward on the required surface; if you have a climb Speed, you may use your full climb Speed instead. The surface does not need to span the full height of your Stride. You can then either make a ranged Strike at a target within your weapon's first range increment and land in the space you began (or an adjacent space) without taking falling damage, or you can land in a space adjacent to a creature within 10 feet of the required surface without taking falling damage and make a melee Strike against that creature. Either Strike deals an extra two dice of weapon damage. In addition, the target dealt damage by your Strike must succeed at a `Fortitude check` saving throw against your class DC or become [[Conditions/Stunned|Stunned 1]].

## [[Feats/Leaping Hedgehog Strike|Leaping Hedgehog Strike]] Feat 16

*   mythic

You pounce toward an enemy and then barrel them over with one fluid movement, ending this maneuver with an attack that may catch them off-balance. [[Actions/Leap|Leap]] horizontally toward an enemy you can see; treat your Speed as 30 feet or more for this Leap if it is less than 30 feet. If you end this movement adjacent to that enemy, attempt an Acrobatics check to [[Actions/Tumble Through|Tumble Through]] that enemy's space. On a success, the target is also knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]. You then Strike that same enemy. If the target has been knocked prone, you can spend 1 Mythic Point as part of this Strike to make it at mythic proficiency.

## [[Feats/Pierce the Eye|Pierce the Eye]] Feat 16

*   mythic

**Requirements** You are wielding a ranged weapon.

* * *

You aim a shot from your weapon directly at a foe's eye, blinding them in the process. Make a ranged Strike. On a hit, the target additionally takes 2d8 persistent bleed damage. The target must also attempt a `Fortitude check` save against your class DC with the following effects.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target is [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] until the end of its next turn.

**Failure** The target is blinded for as long as they are taking the persistent bleed damage and for 1 additional round thereafter.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target also takes a –2 circumstance penalty to the flat check to remove the persistent bleed damage; a creature Administering First Aid to stop this persistent bleed damage takes a –2 circumstance penalty to the Medicine check.

## [[Feats/Terrifying Mien|Terrifying Mien]] Feat 16

*   mythic

Whether they have heard of your legend or seen your prowess on the field of battle, those already quaking in their boots grow weak when forced to stand against you. You gain resistance against bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage against Strikes made by creatures with the [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened]] condition. This resistance is equal to four times the value of that creature's frightened condition.

[[Feat_Feature Effects/Effect_ Terrifying Mien|Effect: Terrifying Mien]]

When this resistance applies to at least one of a creature's Strikes during their turn, that creature doesn't reduce the value of their frightened condition at the end of their turn.

## [[Feats/Weft and Warp|Weft and Warp]] Feat 16

*   mythic

With graceful poise, you perform a dance of dangerous attacks. Stride up to half your speed toward an enemy; if you end this movement adjacent to them make a melee Strike against that foe. If you hit, you can [[Actions/Reposition|Reposition]] the target into your square at the same time that you Step into their square. You then make another Strike against the same target, who is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] to the attack. Finally, you can Step away from that enemy.

## [[Feats/Exaltation Overwhelming|Exaltation Overwhelming]] Feat 18

*   emotion
*   fear
*   mental
*   mythic
*   visual

Raising your weapon or fist aloft, you begin to gleam with dazzling radiance. You fulminate with power and glory, making it clear to all who see you that your legend is real and possibly even greater than purported. Spend a Mythic Point. All enemies who can see you must succeed at a `Will check` saving throw against your class DC or become [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 3]] ([[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 4]] on a critical failure). You and any ally who can see you may choose to Strike or Stride as a free action. Any of these Strikes are made at mythic proficiency.

For the next minute, you gain an extra reaction at the start of each of your turns. You also gain the [[Actions/Speed of Arms|Speed of Arms]] reaction.

## [[Feats/Mythic Weapon Specialization|Mythic Weapon Specialization]] Feat 18

## [[Feats/Unstoppable Force|Unstoppable Force]] Feat 18

Once per 10 minutes, if you Dismiss your Immovable Object stance, you can Stride as a free action. At the end of that Stride, your final footfall causes an explosion of energy. Each creature within a 20-foot emanation takes 14d6 force damage (`Reflex check` save against your class DC). Creatures that fail the save are also knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]].

## [[Feats/Fight Through Oblivion|Fight Through Oblivion]] Feat 20

*   mythic

Mortal wounds that would kill other warriors are no more than the flutter of butterfly wings to you. When you are reduced to 0 Hit Points, you aren't knocked [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]] and you don't gain the [[Conditions/Dying|Dying]] condition. Until the start of your next turn, you become immune to all damage, but you also can't regain Hit Points in any way except the following. If you Strike and damage a foe on this turn, you regain 4d8+30 healing Hit Points. Otherwise, your [[Conditions/Wounded|Wounded]] value increases by 1 and you remain immune to damage and healing. This cycle continues until you regain Hit Points by damaging a foe or until you reach wounded 4, at which point you lose the wounded condition, fall unconscious, and gain the dying condition.

## [[Feats/Finish Their Story!|Finish Their Story!]] Feat 20

*   mythic

Though your tale is immortal, your foes aren't afforded such an advantage and mainly serve only to further your legend. When the time is right, you can shepherd a weaker opponent off this mortal coil. Spend a Mythic Point and make a Strike at mythic proficiency against an enemy. This Strike counts as two attacks for your multiple attack penalty and either kills or damages the target depending on their level, as noted below. After you make this Strike, the target becomes temporarily immune to Finish Their Story!, for 1 hour.

**16th Level or Lower** If the Strike hits, the target dies instantly.

**17th Level** If the Strike hits, the target takes the Strike's normal damage plus an additional three damage die.

**18th Level or Higher** If the Strike hits, the target takes the Strike's normal damage plus an additional two damage die.

## [[Feats/Living Epic|Living Epic]] Feat 20

*   mythic

You are a living legend, a being who cannot be claimed by death, as death has already passed you. You are beyond whatever they wish to make you. When you would be killed, you instead disappear. You reappear anywhere where your name is spoken in the next week. Your name must be said in the context of recounting one of your exploits, including your death. If the person speaking your name is a close ally (such as another PC), you return to life with only 1 Hit Point. However, if a stranger speaks your name, you return to life with full Hit Points and you gain a +1 status bonus to attack rolls, Perception, saving throws, and skill checks for 1 week.

[[Feat_Feature Effects/Effect_ Living Epic|Effect: Living Epic]]

If no one speaks your name within a week of your death, your soul enters the River of Souls, and you can be brought back to life using other means.
