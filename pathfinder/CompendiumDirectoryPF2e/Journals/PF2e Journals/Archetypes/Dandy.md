## [[Feats/Distracting Flattery|Distracting Flattery]] Feat 4

*   archetype

You know how to maintain a good impression and manage your image, even while keeping uncouth company.

Make a `Deception check` check against the target's Will DC. Regardless of your result, the target is temporarily immune to your Distracting Flattery for 10 minutes.

**Success** The target's attitude doesn't decrease as a result of your ally's social blunder.

**Failure** The target's attitude decreases, as normal.

## [[Feats/Gossip Lore|Gossip Lore]] Feat 4

*   archetype

Your time gossiping in fashionable salons keeps you informed on every topic.

You are trained in Gossip Lore, a special Lore skill that can be used only to [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]], but on any topic. If you fail a check to Recall Knowledge with Gossip Lore, you get the effects of the [[Feats/Dubious Knowledge|Dubious Knowledge]] skill feat.

If you have legendary proficiency in Society, you gain expert proficiency in Gossip Lore, but you can't increase your proficiency rank in Gossip Lore by any other means.

## [[Feats/Tut-Tut|Tut-Tut]] Feat 4

*   Uncommon
*   archetype
*   emotion
*   fear
*   mental
*   press

**Trigger** You hit a creature with a melee attack roll.

* * *

The Sapphire Butterfly is not one for violence when simply intimidating a foe will do. From that vigilante's techniques, you've learned how to pull a deadly blow at the last moment, threatening your target instead of striking them. Rather than dealing damage with the triggering Strike, attempt an Intimidation check with a +2 circumstance bonus to [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] all enemies within 30 feet who can see you. If you critically succeed at your check to Demoralize the target of your Strike, their attitude toward you improves by one step while they also become [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]].

## [[Feats/Party Crasher|Party Crasher]] Feat 7

*   archetype
*   skill

You attend all the fashionable society parties, no matter how exclusive they might be.

Any time you encounter a social event you would ordinarily be denied access to, such as a coronation, royal gala, or other society function, you can spend 1d4 hours to secure entry without the need for a skill check. You find invitations, invitees looking for fashionable dates, temporary jobs with the caterers, event staff willing to look the other way, or some other mode of access for yourself and your allies.

This ability doesn't apply to secret events or other small private gatherings with no staff, dates, or outsiders involved.

The DC for this save is equal to your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.
