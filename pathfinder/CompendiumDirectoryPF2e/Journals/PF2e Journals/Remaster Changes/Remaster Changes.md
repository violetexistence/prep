# Remaster Changes
With the 5.9.0 release of the Pathfinder 2e Foundry system we have moved fully to the remaster rules. We want the transition to these rules to be as seamless as possible for groups.

Version 6.X adds the content changes from Player Core 2, finishing the bulk of the remaster changes to the game. The remaster will not be complete until the release of Lost Omens Divine Mysteries, which will feature a remastered version of each deity.

This journal is a reference for GMs or players who are looking for something but can't locate it in the system compendiums or menus, and we have future plans to expand the ability to find items quickly even if you can't remember that _Scorching Ray_ is now called _Blazing Bolt_.

In the pages of this journal you will see the feats, spells, and other items that were heavily altered, merged together, or removed from the system with this release.

One change not noted elsewhere in this journal is that several heritages and ancestries have been merged or renamed to match their new representations in Rage of Elements or Player Core 1 and 2:

*   Aasimar, Aphorite, Ganzi, and Tiefling are merged into [[Heritages/Nephilim|Nephilim]].
*   Ifrit are now [[Heritages/Naari|Naari]].
*   Half-Elves are now [[Heritages/Aiuvarin|Aiuvarin]].
*   Half-Orcs are now [[Heritages/Dromaar|Dromaar]].
*   Gnoll are now [[Ancestries/Kholo|Kholo]].
*   Grippli are now [[Ancestries/Tripkee|Tripkee]].

Some items have been removed from the system as they are not compatible with the new rules. Alignment ampoules, for example, are not usable in a game without alignment. However, because we know that people want to use new releases while not fully moving to the remaster rules a copy of all of the legacy content has been made available through the PF2e Legacy Data module. This module also adds alignment back to actors.

This is not a full changelog of the remaster changes. That changelog would be exceptionally large, as many feats and spells had minor tweaks to the descriptions. A full changelog can be built from our github repository, though be aware that the diff file produced affected several thousand files, mostly in changing stored name references.
